Comments on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NPRM RIN 1830-AA22 (Docket No. ED-2015-OCTAE-0003), implementing programs and activities authorized under Title II of WIOA.


For performance accountability (Proposed 677.175) collecting participant Social Security Numbers and matching them with quarterly wage rate data is effective.  However, California Adult Education programs do not uniformly collect Social Security Numbers and some of our students do not have a Social Security Number. There are other data matching mechanisms by which to track employment outcomes.    

Many places in the proposed regulations require greater clarification, including content standards for English Language Acquisition programs (Proposed 463.32), and the definition of Integrated Education and Training (Proposed 463.35).  Also, make clear that Title I funds can support Title II as the definition of Training (WIOA Section 134 (c)(3) includes  (x) adult education and literacy activities, including activities of English language acquisition and integrated education and training programs, when they are provided concurrently and in combination with other training services.

Funding for Adult Education national programs has declined by 25 percent since 2002.  WIOA provides higher authorization levels each year from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2020, but even if fully funded, agencies would still be below the level at which Adult Education was funded a decade ago. With the implantation of WIOA and the focus on integrated education and training, the need for additional funding has never been greater.

Any pilot that has invested that much time in piloting can and does work for a larger airline which can afford to pay him or her more.  Who wants to work for less with those qualifications?  Our small markets are being squeezed out and we the clients are on the losing side with no way to improve our situation.  Perhaps these comments will help those making decisions to see this situation from the Wyoming point of view.

When  I travel by air, I must drive to Casper, Rock Spings, Cody, or Jackson to get a reliable flight.  These drives are minimum of 2 1/2 hours away and over mountain passes!  This is a huge waste of travel time, fuel and a motel room and cost in time and money is in both directions!

How does LNS continue its eligibility for EAS when similarly situated RDG has not qualified?

When actively the consumer complaints either customer care refuse to make good, or the customer is threatened with a potential lawsuit for insisting the airline to make good, they get corporate security involved, who the say that they will involve law enforcement, they ban the customer from flying United Airlines ever again and the frequent flier account is shut down and miles confiscated as well, at times they may allege that miles were bartered or sold.

Emotional Support Animals (ESAs) should still require medical documentation however I feel a doctors note dated within the year should be more than sufficient instead of jumping through hoops on what the letter has to say specifically if it says something along the lines of ""(insert name here) has a disability and requires his/her ESA to accompany him/her"" that should be sufficient.  The wording shouldn't hold up a passenger as ESAs can also provide a critical function in keeping the handler calm.

Finally I also believe those accompanied by Service Animals, PSDs, and/or ESAs should be allotted extra leg room or a free seat next to them (if the plane isn't full) to maximize the use of their Service Animal, PSD, or ESA.

I ask that you ban across all flights the use of e-cigarettes or other vaping devices. There is sufficient evidence pointing toward the contents of the aerosol that they are not harmless. Nor is it healthy for kids to be exposed to seeing adults vape or smoke products that look a lot like cigarettes. They may ultimately be safer than conventional cigarettes, but the information available on them is showing that they aren't safe. Nor regulated. Deaths among children have occurred from exposure to the nicotine in the cartridges. Airline carriers do not allow other potentially harmful products on board, nor should they allow e-cigarettes.

Thank you for considering a comprehensive ban that helps families, regular flyers, and other members of the public feel safe when on a flight - and not have to wonder if this or that flight will be treating e-cigarettes differently. 

Thank you,

 I am a health educator who has worked in tobacco control and prevention for many years.  While the long term effects of using e-cigarettes and/or being exposed to the vapor from others' e-cigarettes have not been sufficiently studied at this time, we do already know that there are carcinogens and ultra-fine particles in the vapor, along with, of course, nicotine. I believe this knowledge should be enough to warrant regulations prohibiting the use of e-cigarettes, or any vaping device, on aircraft where the air is circulated and shared by everyone on the plane. After the disastrous effects on airline personnel's health due to second hand smoke in the past, surely we do not want to wait until they are ill and dying in large numbers before we regulate yet another source of air pollution. Further, I have a heart condition and my grandson has asthma.  I do not think either of us should be subjected to other people's vapor in an enclosed space, certainly not when we have to pay for being in this enclosed space and have no way of escaping it until the aircraft lands. Thank you.",,,,,,,

See Sottera, Inc. v. Food & Drug Administration, 627 F.3d 891 (D.C. Cir. 2010)(stating electronic cigarettes are often tobacco products). As an asthmatic child, even the smallest toxin in the air could have triggered an asthma attack requiring use of a prescription inhaler. This was a constant struggle growing up. What if an electronic smoking device causes pollution in an airplane cabin triggering an asthma attack in an asthmatic child or adult? Where would the asthmatic individual retreat in a pressurized airplane cabin at high altitudes to breathe in clean air?
	The Department has provided research on non-asthmatic individuals stating exposure to propylene glycol mist from artificial smoke generators may cause acute ocular and upper airway irritation, and in a few cases people reacted with cough and slight airway obstruction. See G Wieslander, D Norbck, and T Lindgren, Experimental exposure to propylene glycol mist in aviation emergency training: Acute ocular and respiratory effects, Occupational and Environmental Medicine2001; 58:649-655. If non-asthmatic individuals reacted with slight airway obstruction from artificial smoke generators, then an asthmatic individual will likely have greater than slight airway obstruction causing a severe health risk. 
	According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in twelve people had asthma in 2009. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Vital Signs, May 2011. Additionally, more than half of the individuals diagnosed with asthma in 2008 had an asthma attack within that year. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Vital Signs, May 2011. Clearly, asthma is one of many valid concerns for the Department in the broadening of Part 252. 
	The purpose of the proposed rule is to prevent introduction of a new potential source of contamination to the cabin environment that could potentially endanger the welfare of nonsmokers who are now protected from all such exposure. The only way to prevent endangering the welfare of nonsmokers is a complete ban against any type of nonprescription inhalation device that may produce toxins into an airplane cabin. Amtrak and the U.S. Navy set the standard for banned use of electronic smoking devices in all areas and the Department must follow by banning all use of electronic smoking devices in all flights. 
	The Department should extend the ban on smoking to all charter flights of air carriers and foreign air carriers between points in the U.S. and between the U.S. and any foreign point with aircraft that have a designed seating capacity of nineteen or more passenger seats. It is estimated that the number of people with asthma will grow by more than 100 million by 2025. World Health Organization. Global surveillance, prevention and control of chronic respiratory diseases: a comprehensive approach, 2007. Asthma is a global concern. The only way to prevent pollution of unclean air into an airplane cabin is a complete ban on all electronic smoking devices in all chartered and commercial flights.

  I have been dealing with asthma since I was a little girl.  Even the scent of perfumes impacts my breathing and at times causes me to reach for my inhaler.  The thought of being on an aircraft with someone who is puffing an e-cigarette causes me great alarm.  Although the e-cigarette is SUPPOSE to be healthier, pollutants (nicotine, formaldehyde) are yet spread in the air, particularly, within the enclosed space of an aircraft carrier leaving all within its cavity to breathe in the harmful toxins...especially, me!   It would be a step backward if Department of Transportation is not proactive in banning e-cigarettes from aircraft carriers, as we all have the right to breathe clean air.

Respectfully Submitted.

I recall my first flight, which was from NYC to Mexico, in the mid 1950's, when during which, free packages of cigarettes with women in mind, were handed out.  They were oval shaped and in a variety of pastel colors.  I was in my early 30's and never put a cigarette to my lips before -- thank goodness, it didn't take.  In my 40's I began to suffer greatly from second-hand smoke on jobs.  In the hospital for hysterectomy, I was being pushed back from surgery into my room filled with visitors' tobacco smoke, I yelled, ""get me out of here!"" and so my hospital bed was pushed into some huge dark cavernous room -- while the smokers were free to continue!  I got into a great deal of debt from inability to stay on a job.  I was frequently on unemployment insurance from sickness.  I was verbally abused, told by smokers, ""Why don't you work in a church!"" and ""Why don't you smoke so it won't bother you!""  Post Offices and banks as well as restaurants were off limits, all the while, the smokers claimed their ""Rights.""  Until we changed the laws -- and now we victims of their ""rights"" have ours!

our garage it did alot damage,  by making complaint, written letters it failed on deaf ears , because smokers protect smokers and that took our
right away as non smokers in the apartment community, in protection of my health and my client, I was forced  to move, into another community
with nothing, except the clothes on our backs, and our vehicle, that had to be reupholstered,  second hand smoke can kill you just as bad, recently
cvs drug store remove all the cigarettes off there shelves, and walgreen was proud to pick up there business, it is all about the dollars, not about peoples rights to breath fresh air while they ride bicycles, motorcycle, walking, or opening a window to let fresh air in, instead you get to inhale someone else second handsmoke, just image being on an airplane in closed all is between you is a curtain,  and someone lights you have no
place to run or hide, you tell the smoker to put out there cigarette,  the first thing out of there mouth is smoke and what about my rights
to smoke, new laws should be no smoking in apartment complex especially,  no smoking in or out of a business within a 200 feet
delivery drivers that deliver food prohibited,  or people who work around food, family settings, parks, and it should be illegal to stick your arm out
of your vehicle holding a lit cigarettes, banned all cigarett,  because smokers are not responsible in there bad habits,  and don't care about other around them, for the full story ask me g_darty@yahoo.com no one like to be rail roaded by a apartment complex,  the  court system, collection
agency, and paid off judges ran by the apartment association or who ever, to avoid going thru proper channels,  and avoid getting caught for during someone wrong and protecting there investment, but ruins someone else life because they are non smokers, non smokers voices need to be heard
and there story told without falling on deaf ear, e cigarettes, regular cigaretts, or any kind of cigarettes, cigar should not be allowed
in the air private jet gray area but commercial none what so ever, tobacco companies they make an addiction product, there profiting
from years and years, make billion of dollars, now take those billion of dollar and put back into the oboma care health system
or pay off victims of second hand smoke, from smokers what it come downs to is choice, you don't have smoke, you don't have to drink,
you don't have text and drive, if someone puts a cigarett in your hand, does not mean you have to smoke it, just say no, people
rather lose there car, there home, or skip a bill, just for a cartoon of cigarettes and the is a sham, I have heard all the excuses
my parents smoke, my friends smoke, it stills means you have choice, I made a choice not too, mildred tina upton Darty died in bed
smoking a cigarett (fire) December 11th 1969 a morning I will never forget and maybe our lives would be different now, if this maynot
have happen, cigarett smokers cause alot of fires, flipping there butt out, grass fires, dropping there cigarett while driving
apartment complex have burned down, people lost there home, parks have burn down from cigaretts flip butts, and people have
used cigaretts as a weapon on kids, and animals which is wrong, new laws need to be passed to protect non smokers rights
to breath fresh air, and right to move without retaliation,  from owner or management of apartment complex communities
which we fell victim too, and it is a long drop as well as a short drop of a lit cigarett on a plane filled with innocent people on board
That had to die because someone wanted to smoke a cigarett 300 to 1 lives lost not counting the ones after the plane crashes to the

When I converse with cigarette smokers, they always make clear statements of how they wished that they had never started the nasty little habit. But now, because they are hooked, their addiction purpose a health risk not only to themselves but to others as well.  America has progressed over the years with tobacco issues in baby steps which is good.  So, even though the numbers are down, tobacco- nicotine addiction is still around, going no where fast.

I do not want a situation where taking air travel (which is a quasi-necessity in the modern world) requires me to consent to exposing myself to second-hand e-cigarette vapor.  The federal government has an interest in combating nicotine addiction of all kinds.  The government also has an interest in the health and safety of air travelers, and in fostering business, commerce, and tourism by making air travel comfortable. For these reasons, the government should extend its current prohibitions against smoking on aircraft to cover e-cigarette use.

There is now ample evidence that electronic smoking devices expose those around them to second-hand aerosol chemicals, just as traditional smoking exposes non-smokers to second hand smoke.

All the major US-based mainline airlines already have their own ban in place.  It's time for public policy to match.  Aircraft (or any other sort of enclosed public transit) are not an appropriate place for ""vaping"" (or for smoking, although that is already banned.)",,,,,,,

Those studies that are in are showing that it is harmful. I have only noticed my own personal affects and that is a burning sensation and then sometimes coughing. I would not fly ever if there was smoking on board airlines. If ecigs become okay to smoke then I will not be traveling via plane anymore.

I have the right to breathe clean air and not be poisoned by someone else's choice to poison themselves.

Smoking with designated seating capacities over the amount of 19 is against the law, the includes U.S. carriers and foreign carriers. I agree with this amendment to the law regarding aircraft smoking, although I believe the rule should be extended to all public aircraft. Smaller airports have planes with under 19 designated seats and they, as well, should have to obey by the proposed rule.

Because TSA officers have free rein to open any luggage at will, they should be held accountable for that action. Ive had multiple cases where my suitcase was not latched completely shut after an inspection and anther time when a piece of clothing was left dangling outside the suitcase.  Inside the suitcase each time, I found an anonymous note saying that my luggage had been inspected.  However, it was impossible to complain about the sloppy work, because there was no way to know which agent at which airport had done the inspection.  It would be very simple for each agent to have an individually identifiable stamp that could be placed on that paper notice that would hold that agent responsible for his/her actions. The clothing industry does something similar with their Inspected by #22 slips of paper, and theres A LOT LESS at stake with inspecting a mens shirt than breaking into a persons luggage.

Our family travels by air every three months and over the course of doing this for six (6) years,  we have noticed significant changes in the amount of space provided for passengers, or not provided as the case may be, in the way of legroom for certain passengers with disabilities.  Our travel is from Texas to Hawai'i, so flights which are long in duration, but impacts persons with certain disabilities and/or service animals whether it's a 7 hour flight or 2 hour flight.

Under the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) certain passengers, and it's very specific as to who qualifies,  may request bulkhead or other seating which provides more legroom due to the qualifying disability.   This rule was put in place so that passengers with certain qualifying disabilities may have an opportunity for equal access to travel, i.e.  a person with an immobilized leg, braces, crutches, and service animals.

Recently, some of the major airlines have sent certain aircraft for re-configuration.   The end result is space is being taken from bulkhead and added elsewhere in the aircraft to generate more revenue.  By doing this, whether intentional or not, by design, if a qualifying passenger with immobilized leg, cast, braces, or service animals cannot fit, there is exclusion and no longer have equal access to air travel, unless the passenger has money to fly first class.  In certain aircraft we travel on, even the first class bulkhead has had legroom reduced to the point of almost no access.   In the main cabin, the space is typically reduced  by one to three more inches.

I'm asking this Advisory Committee to also take the following into account as an example of why we are even more concerned. 

Last summer, Hawaiian Airlines sent a fleet of their Airbus aircraft for re-configuration.   This fleet primarily services the West Coast to the Hawaiian Islands.
Hawaiian Airlines elected not to include bulkhead seating in the ""main cabin"", where most passengers pay to sit.
So rather than keep standard bulkhead seating in what Hawaiian Airlines calls its main cabin,   Hawaiian Airlines created what they call a ""separate class of service"" and they advise passengers this is where the bulkhead seating is now situated.
They advise there is no longer a bulkhead row in the main cabin.    As a result, if you require the bulhead or other seating which will accommodate a qualifying disability under the ACAA, then you must pay more to sit in the new ""separate class of service"", or pay even more and fly first class, or worse, not be able to go at all if you cannot afford to upgrade seating and you are excluded from the main cabin where most passengers fly.

We ask this Advisory Committee to keep in mind airlines customers who have qualifying disabilities under the ACAA and in particular, those who qualify for the bulkhead seats as you consider passenger space issues.

We would ask this Advisory Committee to help ensure that airlines be required to provide equal access to each class of service it offers customers, including providing a bulkhead or space which would not exclude those passengers the Air Carrier Access specifically went into detail to ensure access was provided, i.e. those passengers with immobilized legs, braces, service animals, etc.   Ironically, the very narrow qualifying passengers the ACAA intended to protect, are in jeopardy of being completely excluded.

On behalf of my son, Steven and his service dog, Sophie, (a Labrador Retriever, 80 pounds, not the standard 100 pound Lab),   we thank you in advance for allowing us this opportunity to voice our concerns.

For individuals such as me and others who are tall the feeling is that the space shrinkage is intended to pile up passengers like sardines in a can. I cannot think of any other reason for this than to increase the airlines' profits which have reached incredibly high levels in the last couple of years.

The shrinkage is unhealthy since it can lead to the very dangerous and life threatening formation of clots in the deep veins of the legs. These can cause death. Also, in the event of an emergency evacuation where quick and effective movement is expected, the increased number of passengers in more cramped spaces would substantially raise the number of casualties.

I believe that eventually the airlines shrinking their seating spaces will end up losing customers. I and, others I know, seek to fly uniquely in airlines with more comfortable spaces. Sadly, most of those airlines are not American. My travel abroad in the last few years has been uniquely limited to foreign airlines where the seats are more comfortable and, incidentally, the in-flight service and amenities are much better. I would much rather fly in American airlines but long flights in small seats, mostly fit for middle school size passengers, has become an experience to avoid.

I hope the Advisory Committee for Aviation Consumer Protection seeks the advice from safety and medical experts to comment on the shrinking seat size in many of the American airlines in particular. ",,,,,,,

While AA does say that they TRY to accommodate passengers, they also state that the airline can simply refund the money paid (or miles tendered) and the passenger has no choice. Please look past what AA says ""we will do because we are nice guys"".  What matters is what they MUST do.

As has been argued by the Complainants, the choice of which of the ""three options"" applies when a carrier initiated change occurs MUST lie with the passenger.  Any other interpretation will allow airlines to cancel flights and give back money and miles without accommodation of passengers who have entered into a contract of carriage and then find themselves without a ticket.

This particular aspect is larger than a matter of BA fuel taxes (the issue of these complaints), but can have significant repercussions to a great many travelers.  Passengers must be protected against airlines canceling flights or 'changing schedules' and forcing passengers to just get their money back.",,,,,,,

Mr. Jeff Gorham
Office of Airline Information

1200 New Jersey Avenue SE
Washington, DC 20590-0001

Dear Mr. Gorham:
Bloomberg News respectfully submits this comment to request that BTS release the 20-year-old airframe and aircraft engine cost data of the 12 impacted airlines.  Bloomberg News, as part of Bloomberg L.P., provides data, news and analytics to decisions makers across all industries, including the aerospace industry.  Bloomberg News is delivered through the Bloomberg Professional Service, television, radio, mobile, the Internet, two magazines (Bloomberg Markets and Bloomberg Businessweek), and is syndicated in hundreds of newspapers globally.  In covering the world with more than 2,300 news and multimedia professionals at 146 bureaus in 72 countries, we are experts in disseminating and analyzing information.

The information at issue is now 20 years old. Given the passage of time, any interest in keeping the data out of the public domain has presumably lessened. A policy of disclosure of cost data after 20 years would seem to achieve a reasonable balance between transparency and maintaining the confidentiality of potentially sensitive commercial information.

Bloomberg News appreciates the Department of Transportation's reconsideration and review of the confidentiality period for BTS airframe and aircraft cost data. 

Sincerely,



Edward Dufner
Americas Industrial/Aerospace Team Leader

This also gives airlines too much leeway to say ""oops, that was a mistake"". Who's to say what's a glitch and what's cheap fare, where do we draw the line?

Airlines have no problem charging consumers for ""mistakes"", such as arriving late and missing a flight, packing a little too much in a suitcase, canceling due to life/schedule changes, etc. They also have no problem nickle & diming consumers on EVERYTHING. It's completely unethical and anti-consumer to give them an ""out"" from honoring fares they sold and offered.",,,,,,,

If the airline can choose to correct a mistake by voiding sold tickets but consumers can't, the system is unbalanced.  

Currently, operators Norwegian Air Shuttle and WOW Air have entered the trans-Atlantic market with shockingly low prices.  The latter entered fares that were not mistakes of $99 each way.  Additionally, there are business class fares currently in the range of $1200 to and from Europe on every alliance, yet British Airways claimed that $1800 fares form Austin to Dubai were clear mistakes.  How can a consumer know that when they book a $200 ticket to Iceland that the fare is valid, or that $1800 to Dubai is a mistake when competitive fares are still in that range?  Emirates also sold tickets (and does so frequently) in pairs for $899 from JFK-Milan, that's less than $450/person all-in, and United has fares to Hong Kong from Philadelphia for less than $550 today (5/20/2015).  

Average consumers can't be expected to understand complex fare construction and know, for example, that YQ (commonly used fare code for fuel surcharges) are meant to be included in some fares (British Airways) and not in others (American Airlines). If the YQ is absent, British Airways would call it a mistake fare, but buyers of tickets on their partner American would not know to look for that, identify the error, and then avoid the booking because it had been mislabeled.  

Airlines had carte blanche before CFR 399.88 was in place to choose when they would and would not be responsible for their mistakes.  They could choose to ""honor"" a fare out of goodwill, or to avoid legal action, but this is unfair to consumers.  If I, as a consumer, buy a product and make a mistake when I purchase it I don't get to choose whether or not to ""honor"" my original purchase, but rather I am subject to the company's return policy which is non-uniform and can vary store to store and state to state.  

I would not argue that the advent of resources in the frequent flyer community make these mistakes much larger than they were before, however, these same conditions exist elsewhere in industry.  Twitter, blogs, and forums exist in every niche community from ""mom"" groups to players of certain video games.  Dansdeals.com is a site where bargain hunters go to find great deals and occasionally price mistakes are highlighted on the site. However, if an order is processed - mistake or not - in most states the vendor is liable for the price they agreed upon with the customer.  Why is airfare different?

The title of this proposed rule: Transparency of Airline Ancillary Fees and Other Consumer Protection Issues will do little to resolve the murky waters of airline pricing if carriers aren't held accountable for what they sell.  I would argue that not only should they honor their mistakes, but the legislation should be extended to cruise lines, buses, trains and hotels.  

There are certainly bad actors on both sides of this transaction.  Some purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of airfare, some of which they would not even fly for pennies on the dollar during the United Danish Kroner issue, and that seems unfair to the airline.  But is it not the responsibility of a business owner to make sure their merchandise is accurately priced?  What would stop a gas station owner from changing the price of a gallon of unleaded from $2.99 to $.29 and then once someone has already filled their car and there is a line around the block, claiming that the price was not valid and demanding the rest of the price.  ""You should have know that was an error"" the gas station owner might say, except that every now and again gas stations get people in the door by dropping their prices for a brief time to incredibly low rates.  

Airlines can be bad actors too.  Recently, several American carriers were found to have price fixed routes to Seoul or settled out of court on compelling evidence.  This isn't the first time this has happened and it is unlikely it is the last.

If I were to hold up signs with prices and routes (as listed above) without showing the airline's name, could you tell if it was a mistake?  If not, how can a consumer, and should they be liable for conducting thorough route analysis to determine that this carrier would go low but not that low? 

Finally, we live in an era where Twitter, forums, and other online presences can compound an issue for any business - airline or otherwise.  That does not mean the DoT should allow them to no longer be responsible for the mistakes of their employees or antiquated technology.  

Whatever choice is made regarding this CFR, it should be forced consistently and without prejudice.  If the rule stands, then United should be (in future situations) required to honor tickets, bad actors or not.  Consumers will continue to be on the hook for their mistakes too.  But the way the rule stands now (unenforced) is ineffective. ",,,,,,,

So much power that when I wanted to keep an open seat that I paid for to be used by another traveler whose plans changed at the last minute and they could not travel, that the airline said no, they had the right to steal my money and sell the seat to someone else.

Unless they want to figure out how to work with all customers - so far, that hasn't been a direction they want to head.

Airlines could easily avoid these types of problems by 
adding additional logic to their pricing programs; for example, if a fare is being changed to one that is 50% of 
historical averages, it would need to be routed to a manager for manual approval before being posted.

Airlines should be required to continue to abide by existing policies that require them to honor purchased tickets.  
If nothing else, this would provide them with incentive to fix their pricing systems.

Conversely, changing the existing policies gives airlines the ability to decide that a bona fide pricing change is actually a 
""mistake"" (if for example, an airline realized it did not need to cut a fare as deeply as it purposely did) and cancel tickets 
people purchased in good faith, with no recourse for purchasers.

While the existing rules are subject to abuse by passengers, the travelling public has no other practical means of redress 
against large airlines and their contracts of adhesion except for rules issued and enforced by DOT.  Please do not eliminate 
one of the few means left to the travelling public to protect themselves against obnoxious practices of airlines, and actually
give airlines the ability to manipulate prices further in their favor as discussed in the previous paragraph.",,,,,,,

If I, as a consumer, buy a product and make a mistake when I purchase it I don't get to choose whether or not to ""honor"" my original purchase, but rather I am subject to the company's return policy which is non-uniform and can vary store to store and state to state.

I would not argue that the advent of resources in the frequent flyer community make these mistakes much larger than they were before, however, these same conditions exist elsewhere in industry. Twitter, blogs, and forums exist in every niche community from ""mom"" groups to players of certain video games. Dansdeals.com is a site where bargain hunters go to find great deals and occasionally price mistakes are highlighted on the site. However, if an order is processed - mistake or not - in most states the vendor is liable for the price they agreed upon with the customer. Why is airfare different?

The title of this proposed rule: Transparency of Airline Ancillary Fees and Other Consumer Protection Issues will do little to resolve the murky waters of airline pricing if carriers aren't held accountable for what they sell. I would argue that not only should they honor their mistakes, but the legislation should be extended to cruise lines, buses, trains and hotels.

There are certainly bad actors on both sides of this transaction. Some purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of airfare, some of which they would not even fly for pennies on the dollar during the United Danish Kroner issue, and that seems unfair to the airline. But is it not the responsibility of a business owner to make sure their merchandise is accurately priced? What would stop a gas station owner from changing the price of a gallon of unleaded from $2.99 to $.29 and then once someone has already filled their car and there is a line around the block, claiming that the price was not valid and demanding the rest of the price. ""You should have know that was an error"" the gas station owner might say, except that every now and again gas stations get people in the door by dropping their prices for a brief time to incredibly low rates.

Airlines can be bad actors too. Recently, several American carriers were found to have price fixed routes to Seoul or settled out of court on compelling evidence. This isn't the first time this has happened and it is unlikely it is the last.

If I were to hold up signs with prices and routes (as listed above) without showing the airline's name, could you tell if it was a mistake? If not, how can a consumer, and should they be liable for conducting thorough route analysis to determine that this carrier would go low but not that low?

Finally, we live in an era where Twitter, forums, and other online presences can compound an issue for any business - airline or otherwise. That does not mean the DoT should allow them to no longer be responsible for the mistakes of their employees or antiquated technology.

Whatever choice is made regarding this CFR, it should be forced consistently and without prejudice. If the rule stands, then United should be (in future situations) required to honor tickets, bad actors or not. Consumers will continue to be on the hook for their mistakes too. But the way the rule stands now (unenforced) is ineffective.",,,,,,,

I believe in fair play. If the airline wants to void a ticket purchased at an incorrect fare, it should be able to do so, but only if it pays the purchaser the same penalty that that airline imposes on customers who make a mistake during the purchase process. Payment to customer for such mistakes should be made in the currency used to purchase the airfare, not in credits for future travel.",,,,,,,

The timely approval of the ADI firness and interstate air service certification is very much needed for the requested daily airline service between the Youngstown-Warren-Sharon communities from the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport and the Chicago O'Hare International Airport. This will afford the communities connectivity to many connecting destiantions and for business in Chicago. ADI has responded in a positive and timely manner to meet all requests and requirements of the DOT. Approvals by the end of July would make daily service available on or slightly before October 1, 2015. Any further delays may jerpardize the success of this air service as such start-ups in the winter months are more difficult to inirially sustain. Service commencement during the months of October and November will give the service a good foundation to sustain the service prior to the cold winter months. The community has a SCASDP grant totaling $1.2M, has raised the Local Match, and has additional fund raising efforts planned when such service is approved and announced. The DOT's timely approval of the airline fitness and interstate air service certification is greatly appreciated. 

Thank You,

Dan Dickten, A.A.E.
Director of Aviation

We appreciate the significant responsibility of issuing such an Order and can only imagine the work and effort required to meet that responsibility.

As you are aware, recent regulatory changes designed to help improve overall airline safety have also brought an unfortunate side effect of diminishing the availability of air service to non-metropolitan communities. Although we may believe that rules could be adjusted to provide both a safe environment and improve availability, we recognize that there may be more than one point of view on this topic and we do not consider ourselves experts in the field.

We are pleased that the Department of Transportation has demonstrated a willingness to approve carriers who are interested in serving non-metropolitan areas and are specifically pleased with the Order issued on behalf of Aerodynamics Incorporated (ADI). We look forward to engaging ADI in discussions to improve the availability of air service for our community and encourage the Department of Transportation to continue to support additional airlines who may wish to enhance rural air service.

Currently we have to drive to CLE to catch a plane which is a nuisance and expensive with turnpike tolls and parking. There is no competition in parking prices anymore.  Also, as renovations continue prior to the Republican National Convention, the place is torn up and very confusing to navigate inside and outside the terminal.

I would welcome daily service between Youngstown and Chicago and would fly the route at least once or twice per month. This service opens up a whole realm of travel possibilities for the people of the Trumbull County and the Mahoning Valley.  I believe that not only business travelers will benefit, but anyone who wishes to connect to the world. I throw my whole-hearted support to this projected air service and hope that we are up and flying very soon.

This is from United's requirements...
****
Musical instruments

Depending on their size, musical instruments can be carried on board, handled as checked baggage, or carried as cabin-seat baggage.

As carry-on

As part of the allowance of one carry-on bag plus one personal item, a passenger may carry a violin, guitar or other small musical instrument onboard the aircraft if:

The instrument can be stowed in the overhead bin or under the seat in front of the passenger; and
There is space for stowage at the time when the passenger boards the aircraft
Musical instruments transported onboard United and United Express aircraft must be in hard-shell cases.

****
This is a problem for those of us who have always had our small instruments in soft cases (in my case, a small harp or a wooden Irish-style flute), and it would be too expensive to have a hard case custom made for it. This contradicts the new ruling which says that instruments carried in the cabin are to be treated like other carry-on luggage. In addition carry-ons such as computers are not required to be in hard, shock-proof cases even though many laptops are worth hundreds of dollars. United's carry-on rule clearly discriminates against musicians!!  What can be done to bring United Airlines in line with the new regulation?

1.	In its reply Delta has admitted to the violations and identified that fewer than 500 ticket transactions were affected by its 55-day long misrepresentation (page 1). Having identified the affected ticket transactions, Delta admits that it:
	a.	knows who the affected customers are;
	b.	has contact information for these customers;
	c.	has the credit card number used for payment, upon which a restitution credit can be easily applied.
2.	At approximately $400 per ticket of misrepresentation on fewer than 500 ticket transactions, this amounts to less than $200,000 in restitution due to consumers. I urge the DOT to mandate that Delta effect this administratively simple restitution without delay.
3.	Deltas argument that no customers were actually harmed (page 3) makes a mockery of the DOT rules at issue. The DOT rules require truthful information at every turn. With or without the DOT rules, Deltas statement was literally false. The DOT has already found in Edelman v. American Airlines Order 2013-12-6 that customers are entitled to receive truthful and accurate information. And the Complainants show persuasively the deceptive nature of Deltas misrepresentations (Complaint  13-14).
4.	Finally, Deltas reference to Edelman v. Cathay Pacific Order 2013-8-23 is irrelevant. There, a separate company (Oneworld Management Company) made a false statement that was imputed to Cathay through the principle that airlines are responsible for the actions of their ticket agents; here, Delta itself made the false statements. Cathay sells a small amount of tickets in the U.S.; Delta sells tens of thousands of tickets a day in the U.S. Moreover, the Cathay violation occurred relatively shortly after DOT guidance specifically alerted carriers to the risk of making false statements about tax, whereas these Delta false statements occurred years later, at which point Delta was abundantly on notice.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2015-0001-0003/attachment_1.pdf",

This is largely because it allows state transportation agencies to benefit their local communities. By allowing them to use workers from their area, these agencies also help their local economies grow and develop along with their transportation infrastructure. With this policy, not only will these agencies develop transportation but also will create jobs in their areas where they are needed. There is a potential problem however, that workers/firms could be chosen regardless of their qualifications. For example, under this policy, firms with higher bids may be chosen for federal contracts purely because of their proximity to the location, even though they may cost more than a farther firm. It may also lead to unqualified workers being employed because of their proximity to the site, all because qualified workers are further away. So these precautions and situations must be kept in mind when administering Federal Awards even when they are based on geography. I think that with all these precautions taken into consideration, my local area will also benefit as there are a lot of roads in my town that often require maintenance. With these hiring methods, my area will not only have more jobs but will also benefit from the long term benefits of having a stable source of jobs that also improve our transportation infrastructure.",,,,,,,

However, in spite of good intentions, the imposition of rules, too often carry unintended side effects. 

I remember a luxury tax from the 80s. The intent was to take a little from the haves to provide more for the have-nots. Many of my friends at the time, employed in the manufacture of expensive boats, lost their jobs. The haves stopped buying the things subjected to the luxury tax. So government revenues did not go up. The have-nots ended up with less because they lost their jobs. Effectively, although full of good intentions, the legislation had a lose-lose outcome.

Rolling stock systems encompasses an array of specialized manufacturing and construction skill sets, processes, knowledge and understanding. In many cases the companies that produce these products and services bring 100s of years of experience to the bargain. Experience that reduces over-all project costs. 

As an employee of a Catenary systems and materials manufacturer, I fear the imposition of this rule will result in another lose-lose. The purveyors of Buses, Trains, Traction Power Substations, Catenary, Signals and Communications equipment have spent decades moving to their respective places on specialized learning curves. These companies and the people in them represent a unique knowledge base. 

The cost of quality and the cost of inexperience will ultimately fall on the taxpayers and public the intended beneficiaries of the rule. The trade-off between the benefit of local jobs and the detriment to the procurement process (and associated costs) cannot be justified.

The rule will strike a devastating blow to public transportation and the thousands of existing good paying jobs that support it.

Working in the construction industry on Federally funded highway projects from several million to over one billion dollars, I have experience in this area.
The first issue is that funding matches from FHWA or FTA come from a nationwide tax base and therefore should not be funneled to a locality that can give preference to the local community.
The second issue is that large transportation projects offer opportunities for people to seek new opportunities.  Our sustained size is a function of our ability to expand into new markets when our market slows down.  When we move into a new market we bring people who are ready to grow into higher paying positions and we fill the needed positions with people from the local workforce.  Exporting people brings a diversity of ideas that bring new techniques and innovations to a new market.  If we are handicapped in our ability to bring the knowledge and skills that can provide a low cost solution, the end result will be stale local workforces with no new ideas. 
Third, the local market will adjust to the preference.  Say a 5% bidders preference is granted.  The local contractor will increase his price by 4% to still beat the non-local contractor.  Eventually the non-local contractor stops bidding and the local contractors bids become status quo. The result coupled with point two above is an expensive and stale workforce. OId ideas that cost more.
Fourth, we have bid in local government environments where a bidders preference was allowed (no federal funds).  The system is too corruptible and the enforcement is inconsistent.  We have opted not to bid on projects where we perceived the local government preference requirements to be ambiguous and the penalty for not being in compliance not worth the risk.  Essentially, conforming to the bidders preference, especially in regards to using local subcontractors and labor, only because they are local and not because they are ""qualified,"" could compromise our core values of integrity and safety.
For these reasons, I oppose the rule.

Moving a factory from location to location for particular procurements would be both a massive financial burden that would be passed along to the buyer resulting in higher costs but also a significant impact to the overall quality of the vehicle. 

We deal with a supply base that is diverse and the transit market typically makes up a very small portion of their customer base.  Components such as engines, transmissions and axles all come from suppliers in the trucking market.  The logistics and applications support for these components is highly complex and have been honed over years of a close working relationship.  Further, small suppliers developed within close proximity to our plants are even more critical to vehicle quality.  To disrupt these supply chain arrangements would be disasterous.

When it comes to assembly staff, the amount of training required and ramp up of a new production site would impact vehicle quality negatively.  Further, no new jobs get created in such scenarios.  It is merely a matter of moving jobs from one location to another with no net increase.

Consequently, it is both impractical and imprudent to implement such a policy.

A general contractor cannot guarantee that all of the workers that they hire will be from a local region in which the project is bidding.  Therefore how can a preference being attained.

This creates an unleveled playing field when it comes to competition for low bid work.  Companies work can meet the preference and those who cannot because of union agreements.  

The preference should not be at the worker level but at the company that is bidding the project level.  A local preference is OK with us but not a preference in which there is no metric to measure at bid time but only a commitment.

Moving jobs from a companies core US manufacturing location to another location in order to obtain local hiring preferences is counter productive. Currently there are eight large passenger rail rolling stock manufactures with permanent facilities in the US. These companies have invested tens of millions of dollars in these facilities and worker training so it is not feasible for them to relocate. Most of these companies have made binding commitments to state and local governments to achieve employment goals in order to access industrial development funding and tax incentives. Local preference would cause a loss of jobs in a manufacturers current factory location and moving those jobs would substantially increase cost to the transit agency utilizing local preference with no overall gain in US employment. Many of these facilities are in rural areas that are very dependent on these manufacturing jobs as much as or more than any other area in the US. There is already a huge amount of overcapacity in the US passenger rail rolling stock market and this proposal will only weaken an already very cyclical market between the manufactures that are already in place.  Using local preference in evaluating projects while using Federal dollars is currently against current regulations which was put in place for good reason. If Recipients/Grantees want the federal funding, then hiring/subcontracting opportunities should continue to be federal as well.  If an agency wants to limit hiring/subcontracting preferences to local firms, then they should fund it 100% locally (i.e., city, county, state).

While this development is great and welcomed, it is rare to see a person of color working on a federally-funded construction project in our city.  The City of Detroit is nearly 90% people of color, yet the majority of the city's construction projects are lacking in this diversity. The majority of construction workers are geographically from outside outside of the city, and are not representative of Detroit's citizenship.  Detroit has one of the highest unemployment rates in the state, and could most benefit from jobs created via federally funded construction projects.  This proposed rule would aid in ensuring Detroiters get an equal piece of the pie, and get equal access to these important and desperately needed jobs.",,,,,,,

Geographic-Based Hiring Preferences in Administering Federal Awards
We understand and support the DOTs desire and intent to support the Ladders of Opportunity.  Geographic preferences for construction and other commoditized services make sense where there is an abundant labor pool skilled in the required work.  For highly specialized services, there is a limited pool of qualified, potential bidders.  Restricting the pool of professionals by the imposition of geographic preferences will restrict access to experts in the applicable field and have more than an incidental effect on the pool of potential bidders.

All Americans paid the taxes that fund these projects and all Americans should be able to compete for the work. It might be that simple.


 However, some other comments if it does fly.

The use of Geographic Based hiring in regards to rolling stock is unproductive.

Rolling stock is high technical with high quality requirements. Manufacturing can be moved, but quality processes and quality culture are not easily relocated.

Most rolling stock manufacturers employ people that live near the factory and have for many years,. We sometimes employ whole families. Awarding big contracts in distant cities will result in lay offs for our existing employees. It does not create jobs, just relocates them, which is unproductive.

Geographic hire is a shell game with winners and losers. The losers are our present employees. The winner are the folks that get new jobs, that is, until they are laid off as the work moves around. Then they become the losers.

This will undoubtedly result in higher costs, making American rolling stock manufacturers more uncompetitive than we already are. If you notice, we do not sell any buses or trains outside the US. Why make it any worse?

Construction and operation of federally funded new starts and transit projects are inherently local. Why overshoot? Do a good job with geographic based hiring in construction and operation and leave the marginal unproductive areas alone. What's the old saying? Do not harm.

If geographic based hiring moves forward, it will likely result is less competition for procurements. It will be one more thing to weed out potential interested bidders.

The devil is in the details. How will the proposals utilizing geographic preferences be evaluated? How do you score existing employees, versus rehire of furloughed employees, versus new employees? How long have the new employees lived in this country? There are all sorts of issues that new to be vetted.

This proposal just shuffles the deck with no net gain and is going to take enormous staff time to defend it from the inevitable challenges. This might better be called the attorney employment act.

Focus on creating new jobs. find new sources of funding, be creative with P3's, make proactive steps to get money into transportation projects.

RE: Geographic-Based Hiring Preference in Administering Federal Awards  (Local Hire) 2 CFR Part 1201 [Docket DOTOST20150013] RIN 2105AE38
 
Dear Secretary Foxx:
 
I am Ron Trimmer.  As a member of Gamaliel and the Transportation Equity Network, I led the successful effort to pass SAFETEA-LU section 1920.  Newly elected Senator Obama and his staff helped.  Senator Obama sponsored the provision in the Senate.  We all, including Obama, referred to the legislation as the local hiring amendment.

I am from the St. Louis Metro-east region (Madison County Illinois).  At the time the new Mississippi River Bridge was being planned.  We wanted the project to be used to help the maximum number of poor people, people of color, and women work their way out of poverty into good paying construction careers.

Unfortunately the civil rights department in the FHWA ruled that the language in 1920 was not strong enough and did not allow local hiring.

When I was working to pass 1920 I ran the numbers and showed that local hiring combined with other provisions already in place could move over one million underrepresented minorities into construction careers.  We demonstrated that this approach can work on the I-64 project in St. Louis.  The agreement that was used became known as the Missouri Model.  I am known as the Father of the Missouri Model.  Our MPO region has almost $2 billion in projects scheduled for 2015-2018.

I later found out in discussions with officials in DOT that the local hiring provision was originally put in place to base on competition as currently used to justify the provision, but to prevent good ol boy corruption.

It is recognized that all Americans should have an equal chance to benefit from Federal Infrastructure Investments.  However, women and African-Americans are significantly underrepresented in the trade unions.  There should be about 5 times as many women as there are.  In our St. Louis region there should be 50% more African-Americans in the construction trades than there are.  It is worse in Chicago where there should be 100% more African-Americans in the construction trades than there are.  The point is African American communities cannot benefit fairly from our Federal Infrastructure Investments until the construction trades reflect their communities.  Local hiring can help make that happen by providing opportunities for hardworking reliable African Americans and women to work their way into good paying careers.
Of the approximately $2 billion to be spent in our region about a third is to be spent on transit.  Studies show that transit produced far more jobs created for each $1 billion invested.  Thus, for the St. Louis region it is very important that local hiring be allowed so our poorest communities can work their way out of poverty and get their share of the work.  East St. Louis, Illinois area has some of the highest unemployment and poverty in the nation.  This is not possible with the current makeup of the construction workforce.

Sincerely,

Therefore, we applaud USDOTs efforts to allow city and state departments of transportation to set targeted economic and geographic preferences, as a step toward increased workforce inclusion for all Americans. 

Local hiring policies are a mechanism for connecting local residents, especially lower-income workers, women, and people of color, to jobs associated with transportation projects located in the communities in which they live. Many communities are utilizing local hiring and best value contracting provisions on infrastructure projects large and small. When paired with strong relationships between government, community, labor, and contractors, these provisions can maximize the economic benefit of transportation investments and provide ladders of opportunity to the unemployed and underemployed.

The proposed local hire program sets forth a pathway toward full workforce inclusion for workers who have been traditionally underrepresented in the transportation sector. Going forward, we urge USDOT to make this program permanent to solidify future gains in workforce inclusion.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2015-0013-0038/attachment_1.pdf",

Geographic-based hiring practices for rolling stock on FTA funded projects is impractical and will severely limit competition on every project.  Manufacturers of buses bid on approximately 50 -100 projects per year.  To expect the manufacturers to establish new factories in each of those new cities for the production of those buses is not very realistic for a variety of different reasons.  

Gillig's core business philosophy includes the manufacturing of high quality buses and for us to achieve this goal it is critical for production to come from one centralized plant which builds buses on a large scale.  Experienced workers are the key to providing high quality buses.  That experience cannot be gained on a short and temporary basis for the build of one (or few) order(s) of buses. Quality would suffer with that kind of business approach. We will not risk our high quality reputation on inexperienced workers.

Bus assemblers are a highly trained group of employees.  It would be extremely improbable that we could attract and hire technically qualifed employees on a quick, temporary basis for those ""pop -up"" factories without providing that employee with a long term job commitment.   It should be noted as well, that this proposed rule making will cause significant job layoffs at our existing manufactuing facility so there will be actually no net increase in jobs in the US for this local hiring initiative.  It just provides for a shell game of moving those jobs from one city, or one plant, to the next.  Our communities would be devistated with the movement of our current jobs from of our area.

Another huge detriment to the deployment of geographic-based hiring is the ultimate cost of the project which would increase substantially.   To purchase or lease land, build a new factory or reconfigure an existing factory, hire new employees, train those employees, purchase and provide the necessary tooling, duplicate inventory and production management staff, etc on a city to city, temporary basis would increase overhead costs which would be passed on to the customer resulting in substantially increased bus prices. 

But most importantly, the biggest impediment to this proposed rule making will be limiting competition.  Gillig, as well as other bus manufacturers, have made huge investments in their existing manufacturing facilities and their commitment to their current  employee base.  Fractionalizing all these investments means decreasing production and costing effeciencies which would result in the reduction of already slim margins.  Therefore, Gillig would not find it prudent to participate in any procurement with geographic-based hiring preferences as we feel that would greatly negatively impact the proven success of our company in many ways.

As the operator of a medium sized transit agency, our current employee resources are fully utilized with compliance and tracking efforts for existing state and federal grants/programs. The addition of a geographic-based preference for construction projects or any other project for that matter would add another layer of administrative oversight as staff would need to create checks and balances to ensure contractors and sub-contractors are in fact hiring local employees. While there may be (as it is yet still undetermined) positive impacts on local economies when geographic-based preferences are used for mega-projects, it is unclear whether such an impact would be the same for the small and medium sized projects that many agencies routinely enter into; and whether those impacts would offset the additional administrative burden placed on the local agency. Moreover, if there are positive effects on the local economy, they would most likely only be temporary. Additionally, any program that essentially limits the pool of bidders, even unintentionally, will result in the local agency paying more for the cost of goods and services  further straining already tight budgets. Lastly, the introduction of geographic-based preference requirements could politicize the procurement process and slow down the delivery of critically needed projects.  ",,,,,,,

Dear Secretary Foxx:

We are writing on behalf of the Jobs to Move America Coalition (hereinafter JMA), an alliance of over 40 organizations from across the United States that is dedicated to the creation and improvement of jobs and opportunity for low income communities through the investment of public transportation dollars. Specific organizations signing onto this letter are listed below. 

We submit these comments in response to the DOTs Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (hereinafter NPRM) ID number DOT-OST-2015-0013-0002, Geographic-Based Hiring Preferences in Administering Federal Awards. Because the collective work of JMA is focused on the creation of good manufacturing jobs in the transit vehicle manufacturing industry, our comments relate primarily to strengthening the final rule currently entitled Geographic-Based Hiring Preferences in Administering Federal Awards (hereinafter Final Rule) as it relates to rolling stock and other equipment procurement. While we have seen many creative examples of geographic preferences and targeted hiring programs linked to the award of construction contracts, we leave other organizations to comment more specifically in that arena.

GENERAL COMMENTS:

First, we applaud the DOTs proposed rule as well as the recently launched DOT experimental program for 2015. Virtually all of the JMA member organizations have extensive experience in the creation of geographic and targeted-based hiring preferences in public contracting, and therefore recognize the historic nature of the DOTs proposed rule as well as the recently launched DOT experimental program. As discussed below, we urge the DOT to include a direct reference to targeted hiring programs in the Final Rule. The evidence shows that, if grantee agencies are allowed to apply innovative contracting language to all of their procurements, the job creation and economic development impact of that investment will grow substantially.  Past experience has also shown  as described below  that these increased community and economic benefits will occur without significant negative impacts on open competition in the bidding process. In addition, we believe that grantee agencies should be able to use geographic preferences in rolling stock procurement with certain limitations, as described in the attached letter.

Founded in 1946 by paralyzed veterans, United Spinal Association is the largest disability-led nonprofit organization serving and representing the interests of more than a million Americans living with spinal cord injuries and disorders (SCI/D).  United Spinal has dedicated its energy, and programs, to improving the quality of life for these Americans of all ages and advancing their independence.  People with disabilities must have equal and safe access to all transportation options, and employment opportunities in the transportation sector.  

United Spinal Association is supportive of policies that leverage transportation investment to foster healthy, equitable and inclusive communities of opportunity. We support the U.S. DOTs efforts to allow city and state departments of transportation to set economic and geographic preferences, as an initial step toward workforce inclusion for all Americans. Local and targeted hiring policies are a mechanism for connecting local residents, especially lower-income people, women, and people of color, to jobs in the communities in which they live. 

Many communities have employed local and targeted hire provisions on projects large and small, with tangible benefits for their residents seeking quality employment.  Milwaukee implemented local hire policies which increased the employment of local residents on transportation jobs by 16% over in just 4 years.  Los Angeles and Oakland are utilizing local hire policies as well on major projects.  Unfortunately, a U.S. Department of Transportation prohibition on local hire for federally-funded projects has made it difficult for other cities to leverage investments for job and training opportunities.

Research has shown that low-income workers, women, people with disabilities and communities of color are vastly underrepresented in jobs in the transportation sector, when compared with their overall participation in the workforce.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, people with disabilities comprise just 3.8% of the transportation and utilities industry.  In February 2015, only 20% of people with disabilities participated in the workforce compared to 68% of people without disabilities.  

The proposed local and targeted hire program sets forth a pathway toward full workforce inclusion for workers who have been underrepresented in the transportation sector. Going forward, it is important that U.S. DOT make this program permanent, to solidify future gains in workforce inclusion. 

We urge the U.S. DOT to extend this allowance for targeted hiring provisions to apply to women and people with disabilities, who also stand to benefit significantly from such policies. This can be accomplished by inserting a provision into the federal surface transportation authorization that would allow for local and targeted hiring.   In addition, we recommend the U.S. DOT include language supporting contractor compliance with the U.S. Department of Labor Section 503 rule requiring affirmative action policies leading to the employment of people with disabilities.

We urge the U.S. DOT to support such efforts as they are entirely consistent with the departments Ladders of Opportunity Program and represent an important tool for fostering economic and social equity.

The County of Los Angeles (County) supports the proposed rule change permitting local hiring preferences on DOT grant funded projects.  The proposed rule change is in line with the Countys efforts to increase local participation in construction projects, to strengthen communities, spur the local economy, and improve the quality of life for its residents.  The County has its own local hiring programs such as the Local Small Business Preference (SBE) Program, Community Business Enterprise (CBE) Program, Disabled Veteran Business Enterprise (DVBE) Program, and Local Worker Hiring Program which is currently implemented on capital projects.   These programs can now have a greater impact to our communities, especially the disadvantaged communities as these programs expand to include DOT grant funded projects.  Local agencies are very aware of the specific needs of its communities; therefore, the local agency should have the delegated control on the formalization and implementation of the local hiring elements.  We suggest State oversight in local agencies review or approval of the program or selection of projects be limited, as long as the program does not conflict with existing Federal and State regulations.
 
The County is very eager to participate in the pilot program.  We are concerned about term of the pilot program and the length of the SEP-14 approval process on FHWA funded projects.  A pilot program of only 1 year does not allow agencies to take full advantage of the pilot program and advertise enough projects to complete a thorough evaluation of the impacts of the new contracting requirements.  The Countys experience with the SEP-14 process has been lengthy with State and Federal approval and developing protocols for State oversight on new processes.  We recommend that the pilot program be extended beyond its current sunset date of March 2016 and request an expedited approval process by FHWA with clear instructions to all State agencies to expedite implementation and avoid unnecessary and timely oversight protocols.

I have been a tradeswomen with I.U.O.E. Local 18 , am currently a member of the National Task Force on Tradeswomen, and an advocate for women and other marginalized workers for over a decade - advocating for fair access to high-wage construction careers. There have been a wide array of communities which have employed local and targeted hire provisions on construction projects, typically through ""community benefits agreements"".  When complemented with strong partnerships between government, community, Labor, contractors, and training, these can maximize the economic benefit of public investment in local communities. However, the experience of these efforts is mixed with regards to the benefits and implementation process - in particularly for women.  Without keen oversight and partner cooperation, if the Local Hire Policy does not also include policies and practices that ensure that women are hired and retained for the duration of the project, either no or very few women are ever hired, let alone retained for any length of time once hired.  Therefore, all Local Hire Policies must also prioritize the hiring and retention of women, even if the women do not live within the target area.  At the very least, the Executive Order 11246 Regulations governing Federal Construction Contractors Affirmative Action Requirements with goals for women work hours and required actions must be observed and enforced at the same level as local hiring provisions. 

Meaningful access for women into jobs in the transportation industry would narrow the continuing wage gap between men and women, eradicate long-standing patterns of occupational segregation, and help solve the upcoming labor shortages that DOT is predicting. And it would ensure that women are part of the DOTs Ladders of Opportunity and ensure that women are not excluded from construction sites with Local Hire Policies -  including journeywomen, who often do not benefit from these efforts as the focus tends to be on new hires. Putting successful Local Hire Policies together with successful Equal Employment Opportunity practices can solve this problem ensuring both equal opportunity for women and minorities as well as local hires. 

For far too long, the U.S. DOT has not enforced the equal opportunity regulations for federally funded projects.  As such, U.S. DOTs investments have not fulfilled their potential to serve the communities and women and minorities most in need of good transportation jobs.  Lifting the geographical prohibition for federal aid recipients and sub-recipients will not aid women and minorities unless the regulation makes clear that the lifting of this restriction is not instead of EEO regulations but must be done in conjunction with the applicable federal EEO regulations. 

The following policy recommendations are suggested to be implemented along with the implementation of a Local Hiring Policy:
1.	A goal of 15% of all hours worked shall be filled by women. 
2.	Convene compliance/oversight committee of industry stakeholders to ensure that the partnerships are working together to meet the Local Hire Policy workforce goals.
3.	Use On-the-Job-Training/Supportive Services funds to support the workforce goals and retention of those workers - some examples include funding a pre-apprenticeship training, scholarships for new apprentices/hires for work clothes and/or tools, transportation, childcare, and other needs.
4.	Ensure state DOTs notify communities of both Local Hire Policy and OJT/SS funding through a transparent ,  open, and timely process by state DOTs to ensure full collaboration by the community.

To ensure that future gains in workforce inclusion, the U.S. DOT must extend targeted/local hiring provisions to apply to women who stand to benefit significantly from such policies. This can be accomplished by inserting an EEO provision into the federal surface transportation authorization that would allow for both local and targeted hiring.  Please consider supporting such efforts as they are entirely consistent with the departments Ladders of Opportunity Program and represent an important tool for fostering economic and social equity.

Sincerely,

From: Fred Royal

NAACP Milwaukee Branch

The NAACP Milwaukee Branch would like to go on record as being in support of extending the geographic based hiring preferences in administering federal awards. Construction is one of the few areas of labor that can not be out sourced and provides excellent opportunities for meaningful employment.

Milwaukee has suffered immensely from the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs over the past years. The community would benefit greatly from projects awarded from the Department of Transportation. If the preferences of  hiring were based on the geographic area within this city which faces over 40% of African-American males not being employed this provision could be an effective tool to offset some of this high unemployment that this community is currently dealing with.

Comments Submitted by the National Urban League (NUL) concerning the U.S Department of Transportations (DOT) Proposed Rulemaking on Geographic-Based Hiring Preferences in Administering Federal Awards

The NUL is pleased to offer the following comments in strong support of local hire on federally-funded transportation projects in the U.S. DOT's proposed rulemaking on Geographic-Based Hiring Preferences in Administering Federal Awards. [See PDF for full statement]

The NUL is a historic civil rights and urban advocacy organization dedicated to economic empowerment in historically underserved urban communities.  Research shows that we have a long way to go in order to secure economic equality in this country.  According to our just-released 2015 State of Black America report, the National Urban League 2015 Equality IndexTM  of Black  America stands at 72.2 percent, meaning that Blacks experience less than three-fourths the quality of life experienced by white Americans.  Additional key findings from our report dramatize the need, among other policies, to create well-paying jobs that can be accessed in African American communities:

	Black median household income is about 60% of that of whites - $34,815 vs. $57,684 respectively.
	African Americans are more than twice as likely as whites to be living in poverty. The poverty level Equality IndexTM for Black-White is 40%, with 27.6% of Blacks living in poverty vs. 11.1% of whites.
	With the Black-White Unemployment Equality IndexTM at 47%, the Black unemployment rate is more than double the white unemployment rate  with Blacks at 11.3% and whites at 5.3%. 
	With an Equality IndexTM of 6%, Blacks have a median wealth of $6,314 vs. whites who have $110,500  meaning the median African-American household has just 6 cents in wealth for every dollar of white household wealth. 
 
Transportation construction projects provide access to well-paying jobs and, if accessed, can bring economic relief to the unemployed and under-employed. Yet, research  has shown that low-income workers, women, people with disabilities and communities of color are vastly underrepresented in transportation sector jobs when compared with their overall participation in the workforce.  

For far too long, the U.S. Department of Transportation has held on to a prohibition on local hire for federally-funded projects. The Proposed Rule would finally loosen this prohibition and make it clear that geographic hiring preferences may be used in Department of Transportation grant programs. Many communities have employed local and targeted hire provisions on projects large and small with positive results for local residents and the local economy. For example, Gary, IN Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson cites the positive impact that local hire provisions have had in her city:

During the past three years, contractors entrusted with public projects have been pressed to meet local hiring ordinances. Additionally, businesses that move into Gary or expand their business have worked with the city to hire local residents. These efforts are reflective of the reality that new businesses in Gary have the greatest long-term impact when they create employment opportunities for Gary residents. During the course of the past three years, more than 1000 new jobs have been added to the city. At least 65 percent of these jobs have employed city residents.

As cited by PolicyLink, Los Angeles, CA represents another example of the benefits of local hire where the LAX/Crenshaw Light Rail project will create 7,500 jobs.   According to PolicyLink, equity advocates worked to embed a targeted hire provision for the nearly $2 billion project that will ensure that low-income and underemployed residents will benefit from this investment, because 40 percent of the project's work will be reserved for these workers. Upon announcement of the Department of Transportations proposed rulemaking on local hire, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti noted that the City has $36 billion committed to public transportation projects in the L.A. region (including the Crenshaw-to-LAX rail line), and said that locals will be defined as construction workers living in L.A. County.  Other major city mayors outlined what this rule change on local hire would mean for low-income residents in their respective cities. 

The NUL fully supports DOT's efforts to allow city and state departments of transportation to set economic and geographic preferences, as an initial step toward workforce inclusion for all Americans. The NUL also strongly recommends that the DOTs proposed local and targeted hire program be made permanent to solidify future gains in workforce inclusion. 

Thank you for consideration of our comments on this most important rule change.

Sincerely,

 
Marc H. Morial 
President and CEO

Re:  RIN 2105-AE38, Comments on Department of Transportationâs Proposed Rulemaking on Geographic-Based Hiring Preferences in Administering Federal Awards

I am writing in opposition to the U.S. DOT proposal that allows states and local governments to impose geographic hiring requirements on contractors performing federally funded contracts. 

My company builds construction projects that receive federal assistance from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and/or the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). The proposed local hiring preferences may force me to discriminate against some of my existing workforce because I would be required to replace them with new workers I must hire from the jurisdiction with the local hiring preference. My existing workforce is highly trained and skilled, which allows our company to offer to taxpayers the best possibly construction project at the best possible price. If I am forced to hire new and unfamiliar employees, it will impact my ability to deliver an on-time and on-budget project for this contract and other contracts that may not be subject to this order. The culture and safety in our company is created over time and takes an enormous amount of managerial leadership and teamwork to build on.  A mandate to utilize a local workforce will dilute those qualities.

In addition, understating this new mandate and installing appropriate compliance measures, laying off workers and hiring new workers will increase compliance and human resources costs. As a result of these new risks and uncertainties, I may choose not to bid on projects with these requirements. In short, this rule limits competition and is likely to increase project costs for companies and taxpayers.  

Recipients of federal dollars with local hiring requirements should be concerned about the unintended consequences of this rule. It could impact the ability of local residents from working on similar projects in neighboring areas that have instituted their own local hiring rules. Unless there is a steady supply of local construction contracts, the proliferation of local hiring rules could actually lead to less opportunities for the demographic this rule is intended to help.  The mobility of the construction workforce is critical to staffing the manpower needs of the construction industry and any effort to restrict the ability of contractors to meet market demands is problematic.

RE: Geographic-Based Hiring Preference in Administering Federal Awards (local hire) 
2 CFR Part 1201 [Docket DOT-OST-2015-0013] RIN 2105-AE38

Dear Secretary Foxx, 


I am an organizer with Metropolitan Congregations United (MCU) and an ordained clergywoman in the United Methodist Church. I have been active in job creation and economic develop projects through MCU for over 20 years. We have seen the value of local hiring in our St. Louis communities time and again, most notably in transportation based projects. 

St. Louis is finally coming out of the recession of 2007-08 but unemployment is still 6% overall and 10.3% in the African American community. Local hiring keeps unemployment at a low level for everyone. It insures that people are being paid good wages that enable them to invest in their community through spending on basic living expenses and on discretionary spending unachievable on low-wage jobs. 
 
The East-West Gateway Council of Governments, our MPO, lists in its TIP for 2015-2018 over $726 million in projects for the entire St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area (St. Louis City and counties surrounding St. Louis in Missouri and Illinois). Over $503 million is projected to be spent on the Missouri side alone.  This can translate into thousands of jobs over the next three years. 

By MCU working with the Missouri Department of Transportation in creating the Missouri Model on the Interstate 64/40 rebuild, the St. Louis region was able to dedicate $2.5 million to job training out of a $550 million project. 30% of workforce hours were dedicated to apprentices. The goal of local hiring in a transportation job is not just to put people to work once, but to prepare them for future and continued employment. 

Amending the preferences in administering federal awards to specifically impose local hiring rules, has the power to uplift an entire region. We are looking forward to applying those preferences here in St. Louis. 

Sincerely,
Rev. Susan E. Sneed

For the last 5 years, we have led a campaign to ensure that the new jobs created by the expansion of the MBTAs Green Line Subway into our city are available to local low-income, minority, and female residents. The use of geographic hiring preferences is a key tool in achieving that goal, as local residents are most vulnerable to displacement due to gentrification but also most impacted by the possibility of a new transit system. 

We have worked with our city government, state delegation, and the local and state transportation authorities to make this goal a reality through the MassWIN/GLX program, which extends to the cities of Medford, Somerville and Cambridge. Without the explicit approval of the federal government, it is more challenging for us to reach our local hiring goals, because many local players are concerned about potential violations of the constitutions commerce clause. The proposed provision will greatly facilitate our shared goals of making sure the local workforce can be prioritized when making hiring decisions for transit projects of this scale.  The extension of the Green Line in Massachusetts is one of the largest public works projects in the pipeline, with over $1 billion committed to achieve. This scale of work will be an important job generator for our local residents.

Re:  RIN 2105-AE38, Comments on Department of Transportationâs Proposed Rulemaking on Geographic-Based Hiring Preferences in Administering Federal Awards

I am writing in opposition to the U.S. DOT proposal that allows states and local governments to impose geographic hiring requirements on contractors performing federally funded contracts. 

My company builds construction projects that receive federal assistance from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and/or the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). The proposed local hiring preferences may force me to discriminate against some of my existing workforce because I would be required to replace them with new workers I must hire from the jurisdiction with the local hiring preference. My existing workforce is highly trained and skilled, which allows our company to offer to taxpayers the best possibly construction project at the best possible price. If I am forced to hire new and unfamiliar employees, it will impact my ability to deliver an on-time and on-budget project for this contract and other contracts that may not be subject to this order.

Comments Submitted by Center for Community Change concerning the U.S Department of Transportations Proposed Rulemaking on Geographic-Based Hiring Preferences in Administering Federal Awards

The Center for Community Change is pleased to offer the following comments concerning the U.S. Department of Transportations (U.S. DOT) proposed rulemaking on Geographic-Based Hiring Preferences in Administering Federal Awards. 

The Center for Community Change works to build the power and capacity of low-income people, especially low-income people of color, to change their communities and public policies for the better. Our work has included supporting policies that increase transportation equity and access to good transportation jobs for residents in the communities we work with.  We believe policies to support targeted hiring in geographic areas and for people who have had trouble accessing these jobs, such as women and formerly incarcerated people or people with conviction histories, are critical. We support the U.S. DOTs efforts to allow city and state departments of transportation to set economic and geographic preferences, and we view this as a very important step towards creating more jobs that are open and accessible to all.

We want to emphasize our support for the U.S. DOTs proposed rule as well as the recently launched DOT experimental program for 2015. We also urge the DOT to include a direct reference to targeted hiring programs in order to make clear that in addition to geographic hiring preferences, grantees can implement targeted hiring programs aimed at increasing the number of women, people of color, people with disabilities, formerly incarcerated people and people with conviction histories in quality transportation jobs.  Additionally, we want to echo and expand on the comment submitted by the Jobs to Move America Coalition, specifically regarding the creation of a suggested implementation framework that will help ensure transparency, accountability and effective evaluation by grantees. 

Past experience shows that when grantee agencies are allowed to apply innovative contracting language to all of their procurements, the job creation and economic development impact of that investment will grow substantially without significant negative impacts on open competition in the bidding process. Research has shown that low-income workers, women, people with disabilities and communities of color are vastly underrepresented in jobs in the transportation sector, when compared with their overall participation in the workforce . Many communities have successfully employed local and targeted hire provisions on projects large and small, which not only fosters increased economic and social equity but also builds broad support for transportation projects. 

Each year hundreds of thousands of incarcerated people complete their sentences and return to their families in neighborhoods suffering from underemployment and lack of opportunity. Through clearly and specifically making clear that targeted hiring programs can be implemented by grantees, we can help pave the way for more initiatives to help these workers get access to good jobs. 

In order to ensure that employers take targeted hiring seriously, we suggest that the DOT require its grantees to implement basic common language that is inserted into awarded contracts. This language  at a minimum  should spell out reporting requirements on the achievement of targeted or local hire goals, proposed enforcement mechanisms in the case of noncompliance or inaccurate reporting as well as cooperation by the private contractor with the awarding agency in the evaluation of the results of the hiring language. This kind of contract language will give both the grantee and the DOT the ability to assess the success and effectiveness of the grantees language and program. 

Again, the Center for Community Change applauds the DOT for launching this bold initiative and is excited for the ways this rule will support all Americans in gaining access to high quality transportation jobs. 

Sincerely,

Steve Savner

These provisions, when paired with strong relationships between government, community, labor, and contractors, and employment and training opportunities, can maximize the economic benefit of public expenditures in local communities.  However, the experience of Task Force members across the country is mixed. Without keen oversight and partner cooperation, if the Local Hire Policy does not also include policies and practices that ensure that women are hired and retained for the duration of the project, either no or very few women are ever hired, let alone retained for any length of time once hired.  

Therefore, all Local Hire Policies must also prioritize the hiring and retention of women, even if the women do not live within the target area.  At the very least, the Executive Order 11246 Regulations governing Federal Construction Contractors Affirmative Action Requirements with goals for women work hours and required actions must be observed and enforced at the same level as local hiring provisions. For far too long, the U.S. DOT has not enforced the equal opportunity regulations for federally funded projects.  As such, U.S. DOTs investments have not fulfilled their potential to serve the communities and women and minorities most in need of good transportation jobs.  Lifting the geographical prohibition for federal aid recipients and sub-recipients will not aid women and minorities unless the regulation makes clear that the lifting of this restriction is not instead of EEO regulations but must be done in conjunction with the applicable federal EEO regulations. 

Women have faced years of entrenched discrimination and barriers in attempting to access work on federally funded construction projects, a struggle that has kept their numbers far too low. The U.S. DOTs own workforce reports provide ample evidence of the lack of attention to ensuring equal opportunity for women on DOTs construction sites.  The Federal Aid Highway Construction Contractors Annual EEO Workforce Reports FHWA 1391 and 1392,  confirm the consistent underuse of women far below the EO 11246 6.9% goal and even further below the 17% benchmark set for women in similar occupations.Our own experience working in the Chicago area with construction industry stakeholders and tradeswomen is that local hire policies have negative outcomes for women - simply put - women are not hired. City and neighborhood residency requirements are promoted and enforced while gender goals are just that, goals. When contractors do make efforts to meet goals for women on a project, they insist that women also meet residency requirements despite a local ordinance requiring goals for tradeswomen.  

CWIT suggests the following:  
1.A goal of 15% of all hours worked shall be filled by women;2.To satisfy that goal, women must be employed a minimum of 100% of the average staff hours for the category of work for which they were hired throughout the duration of time that the category of work is performed for the covered project.  For example, if cement finishers employed on a particular DOT project an average of 40 hours each week throughout the duration of time that cement finishing is performed, then women cement finishers should work the same amount of time to count towards meeting the 15% goal for women;3.Priority should be given to women who reside within the area and there should be no prohibition of meeting the goal with women who do not live in the targeted area;4.Implement a compliance/oversight committee of industry stakeholders should be convened to ensure that the partnerships are working together to meet the Local Hire Policy workforce and disadvantaged business goals; 5. Use of On-the-Job-Training/Supportive Services funds should be utilized to support the workforce goals and retention of those workers - some examples include funding a pre-apprenticeship training, scholarships for new apprentices/hires for work clothes and/or tools, transportation, childcare, and other identified local needs; 6.Local Hire Policy implementation and complimentary OJT/SS funding should be communicated to communities through a transparent, open, and timely process by state DOTs to ensure full collaboration by the community.

To solidify future gains in workforce inclusion the U.S. DOT must extend targeted hiring provisions to apply to women who stand to benefit significantly from such policies. .  We urge the U.S. DOT to support such efforts as an important tool for fostering economic and social equity.

Our company primarily builds transportation projects that receive federal assistance from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). 

Local hiring preferences will force us to make staffing decisions that may not be in the best interest of our employees or the individuals the preference is intended to help. For example, while the local preference may benefit local labor, the preference requirement will indirectly disadvantage nonresidents by restricting their ability to work in nearby cities or counties. It can also discourage the local labor force from pursuing positions in the construction industry as a career. 

A typical construction crew consists of many specialty craft workers. They may be operators, cement masons, laborers, carpenters and truck drivers. Our approach is to train individuals to be a part of a crew and perform tasks related to that crew's work type specialty. We have found that this method allows an employee to learn a trade and become very proficient in their field of vocation. This works especially well if an employee is inexperienced. As a member of a crew, they have experienced individuals nearby that can give advice and answer questions. But our crews move in and out of projects throughout the season. We may have a crew on a project for a day or a month or the entire season. 

If we are required to maintain a workforce that is based on an individual's address rather than their skill set, it will take away a vital component of training and information exchange. This can result in poor workmanship and create safety issues. It may even dampen an individual's desire to make construction their career by not allowing them enough time to become proficient in a valued skill. This is also true of journeymen workers. 

Over the years most craft workers have worked on perfecting a particular skill set. They might have operated a front end loader for most of their career. When a loader is needed on a project, the operator generally goes with the machine. Once the work for the loader is complete, the machine and operator will move to the next project. By keeping the employee in a specific job task, it provides consistency and continuity to the employee, and allows for continued improvement for the employee in their position. 

We understand the motivation to require contractors to hire unemployed individuals on federally-funded projects; however there are more practical approaches to address this issue. For one, providing the needed training that will provide individuals the skills needed to have a successful career in the construction industry. In addition, it would be beneficial to have long term, stable and sustainable funding for transportation and transit. It is crucial to provide certainty to individuals who may chose to make construction their career.

Based on the issues we have described above, we respectfully request that you do not allow local hiring preferences to be used on FHWA and FTA funded projects.

My company builds transportation projects that receive federal assistance from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and/or the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Local hiring preferences force me to discriminate against some of my workers by laying them off because I have to hire new workers from the jurisdiction with the preference. My workers are well trained and highly skilled. These skills allow our company to offer the taxpayers a high quality construction project that is built safely at the lowest possible cost. Because of the need to lay off some of my workers, I may choose not to bid on projects with these requirements. This limits competition and can increase project costs.

I understand the motivation to force contractors to hire unemployed individuals on federally-funded projects; however, as a Union contractor, we actively participate in numerous training and recruiting efforts already and do not require the government intervention on this issue.

Also, our work as an advanced certified steel erector requires highly trained employees to reduce risk in a dangerous work environment.

The Association is opposed to the U.S. Department of Transportation's proposal that would allow states and local governments to impose geographic hiring requirements on contractors performing federally funded contracts. 

CAWP contractors build transportation projects that receive federal assistance from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and/or the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Local hiring preferences would force contractors to discriminate against certain workers by laying them off in order to hire new workers from the jurisdiction with the preference. Construction employees working for CAWP contractors are well trained and highly skilled. These skills allow western Pennsylvania contractors to offer the taxpayers a high quality construction project that is built safely at the lowest possible cost. However, local hiring preferences have been shown to limit competition and increase project costs.

Through their membership in CAWP, contractors contribute to several joint labor and management training programs that provide individuals the skills needed to have a successful career in the construction industry. These training programs provide a better way for unemployed individuals to work on federally-funded projects, without mandating local hiring preferences.

These unanswered questions are always going to exist for those just ademantely opposed to the program; but, a good result of the pilot program would go a long way to alleviating unnecessary fear.

Our company has extremely loyal employees that not only bring their vast knowledge and experience to every project throughout the country but their checkbooks to feed the local service industries (i.e. hotels, restaurants, bars, etc...). The already short-supplied skilled workforce of operators, truck drivers, mechanics etc... would become extremely magnified if the pool was reduced to a certain geographical areas. 

Allowing companies to bring experienced and knowledgeable employees to projects is the best (and sometimes the only) way to introduce new advancement in products and techniques. In our industry we have taken a concrete mix design from a project in Minnesota that withstands Semi-Truck traffic in 2 hours from the time it is poured and introduced it on a project in Louisiana (as well as other places). This would not and will not be attempted if a company has to train new employees as well as the governing body to these types of advancements. 

In an effort to reduce the overall impact to the traveling public most transportation projects are coming with accelerated completion dates and/or shortened work windows avoiding rush hour or heavy traffic situations. Contractors can't be expected to risk substantial penalties/liquidated damages on projects with an unknown and un-proven workforce. ",,,,,,,

Re: RIN 2105-AE38, Comments on Department of Transportation Proposed Rulemaking on
Geographic-Based Hiring Preferences in Administering Federal Awards

I am writing in opposition to the U.S. DOT proposal that allows states and local governments to impose
geographic hiring requirements on contractors performing federally funded contracts. 

Once more the Federal Government seeks to waste the tax payers money constructing projects with unskilled and untrained people.
Once time and money is spent on training; the newly trained people will find themselves without work like the people they caused to loose their jobs. 

Please make it illegal for any Geographic-Based Hiring Preferences.  Let the free market work.

Re:  RIN 2105-AE38, Comments on Department of Transportations Proposed Rulemaking on Geographic-Based Hiring Preferences in Administering Federal Awards
I am writing in opposition to the U.S. DOT proposal that allows states and local governments to impose geographic hiring requirements on contractors performing federally funded contracts.
My company builds construction projects that receive federal assistance from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and/or the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). The proposed local hiring preferences may force me to discriminate against some of my existing workforce because I would be required to replace them with new workers I must hire from the jurisdiction with the local hiring preference. My existing workforce is highly trained and skilled, which allows our company to offer to taxpayers the best possibly construction project at the best possible price. If I am forced to hire new and unfamiliar employees, it will impact my ability to deliver an on-time and on-budget project for this contract and other contracts that may not be subject to this order. The culture and safety in our company is created over time and takes an enormous amount of managerial leadership and teamwork to build on.  A mandate to utilize a local workforce will dilute those qualities. 
In addition, understating this new mandate and installing appropriate compliance measures, laying off workers and hiring new workers will increase compliance and human resources costs. As a result of these new risks and uncertainties, I may choose not to bid on projects with these requirements. In short, this rule limits competition and is likely to increase project costs for companies and taxpayers. 
Recipients of federal dollars with local hiring requirements should be concerned about the unintended consequences of this rule. It could impact the ability of local residents from working on similar projects in neighboring areas that have instituted their own local hiring rules. Unless there is a steady supply of local construction contracts, the proliferation of local hiring rules could actually lead to less opportunities for the demographic this rule is intended to help.  The mobility of the construction workforce is critical to staffing the manpower needs of the construction industry and any effort to restrict the ability of contractors to meet market demands is problematic.

Docket DOT-OST-2015-0013
RIN 2105-AE38
Geographic-Based Hiring Preferences in Administering Federal Awards
 
Comment of Siemens Rolling Stock USA
 
Thank you for this opportunity to comment on the above-captioned proposed rule.  The most recent notice stated:
 
""The DOT has also received a comment to the docket asking whether this proposed rule applies to rolling stock.  The DOT specifically requests comment on this issue and whether the DOT should clarify the proposed rules application to the procurement of rolling stock.""  80 Fed. Reg. 18784 (April 8, 2015)
 
We respectfully submit that DOT should clarify that this rule does not apply to the procurement of rolling stock.  The main reason is that applying the rule to rolling-stock procurements would unduly limit competition, which DOT acknowledges it does not have discretion to do.  See 80 Fed. Reg. 12092, 12093 (March 6, 2015).
 
Globally, there are at most a dozen passenger rolling-stock vendors with the economic and legal ability to manufacture within the U.S. in the foreseeable future.  In the case of most of them, the company has already established the U.S. factory in which it manufactures rolling stock for customers here. 
 
Establishing a rolling-stock manufacturing facility requires large investments in real estate, structures, equipment, and a trained workforce.  The volume of orders for passenger rolling stock in the U.S. is too low for any vendor to be able to afford to maintain multiple rolling-stock manufacturing plants in this country. 
 
Moreover, it is not economically or socially possible for a company to shutter its rolling-stock manufacturing plant in one part of the U.S. and establish a new one elsewhere in the country for each new order.  As an illustration, Siemens rolling-stock manufacturing plant in Sacramento, California employs nearly 800 people and covers approximately 300,000 square feet. 
 
If an entity procuring passenger rolling stock with the help of federal funding (and very few passenger rolling-stock procurements happen without the help of federal funding) were to require local manufacture, the only vendors that potentially would bid on the project would be those that coincidentally already have a rolling-stock manufacturing plant in that locality, plus those that have not yet established a plant anywhere in the U.S.  That group is substantially smaller than the population of vendors currently in a position to compete for a rolling-stock order in the U.S. today. 
 
Moreover, if this DOT rule were to apply to rolling stock, then any vendor to win an order and consequently establish a manufacturing plant in the customers locality would become part of the population of vendors that would not bid on subsequent procurements in different parts of the U.S.  In short, the inclusion of rolling stock in this DOT rule would immediately shrink the population of rolling-stock vendors able to compete in new procurements in the U.S., and that population would continue to shrink with every additional procurement.  Such a consequence sits comfortably within any definition of unduly limit competition.  Artificially constrained competition leads to unnecessarily high project costs.  It also generates pressure on the excluded vendors to give up on the U.S. market  an outcome that would be to the long-term detriment of metropolitan mass transit and inter-city passenger rail in the U.S.
 
There is at least one other reason this rule should not apply to rolling-stock procurements.  History has shown that a well-established rolling-stock manufacturing plant tends to avoid cost overruns, delays, and quality problems better than a plant that has only just been established and is trying to fill its first order.  DOT should avoid creating a dynamic that leads systemically to more cost overruns, delays, and quality problems.
 
For the foregoing reasons, Siemens Rolling Stock USA respectfully asks DOT to clarify in any final version of this rule that it does not apply to the procurement of rolling stock.",,,,,,,

In summary, ACPA opposes the U.S. DOTs pilot program and other regulatory initiatives aimed at geographic-based hiring preferences in administering federal awards. We feel that the proposed actions are discriminatory, will limit competition, will compromise the integrity of the bidding process, will increase costs to the public, and are based on an erroneous and inadequate regulatory analysis.

The pilot program and the NPRM are focused on objectives that are not consistent with the overarching goal of procurement rules for Federal-aid contracts. As stated in a 1986 opinion, the U.S. DOT Office of Legal Counsel reaffirms that the efficient use of federal funds is the touchstone by which the legality of state procurement rules for federally funded highway projects is to be tested. U.S. DOT has failed to show how the proposed action addresses the efficient use of federal funds.

Instead, we urge the U.S. DOT to focus on voluntary efforts that maximize the economic growth and job-creating opportunities presented by transportation construction. These are not only the best practices in terms of public policy, but also have long served the best interests of taxpayers and all entities responsible for constructing, rehabilitating, and preserving our nations surface transportation infrastructure.

The local hiring preferences that our firm has been involved in as generated frustration among owners, employers and employees.  In a highly skilled, craft level and professional level, industry an regulation to require firms to hire local employees seems to limit an employer to his ability to determine the skill level of local preferences.  As an employer, we try to maintain a skilled workforce and keep them employed throughout the duration of the construction season.  With a regulatory mandate, we will not want to lose our employees and will add additional cost to a project to hire and meet the local preference regulation.  The last local preference contract we were involved with we actually found out after the bidding process and we ended up paying a fee to the tribe, who could not provide any local help.  As a contractor, we need to be able to determine the skill level of our workforce in order to accurately calculate production rates and schedules to complete the work.  A local hiring preference will remove that ability from the firm, and in order to protect our interest a firm will put a contingency into the bid to ensure that they have their cost covered.    There appears to be no advantage to this regulation.  In an industry that is facing a lack of skilled work force anyone that is qualified should be able to find a position in this industry anywhere.  If you want to increase the lack of unskilled labor and add additional cost to projects this regulation will meet those goals.  As a firm and tax payer I oppose this regulation.  ",,,,,,,

This belief is founded on our determination, based on past experience, that geographical hiring preferences applied to Metro's Rolling Stock projects can be implemented in a reasonable and measured manner that is consistent with federal objectives for free and open competition. As a result, Metro has proposed a Local Employment Program (LEP) that meets the federal grant rule standards for encouraging open competition with no barriers to entry. Metro's LEP is patterned after its successful U.S. Employment Program (USEP). Metro's USEP has been proven to create no advantages or disadvantages to any interested proposers, and all TVMs have an equal ability compete without drastic alteration to its means and methods of production. To support this assertion Metro describes two case studies that prove that Metro's USEP, and by extension Metro's proposed LEP, fosters competition and creates local jobs without disruption to existing jobs and manufacturing efficiencies.

For many years, transit bus purchases have been for replacement vehicles with little or no purchases to expand bus fleets.  This lack of growth has led transit bus manufacturers to focus on a well-trained workforce at their facilities.  To require a transit bus manufacturer to hire local workers for a bus manufacturing contract will result in shifting employment from one location to another.  It will increase the cost of transit buses as transit bus manufacturers will need to acquire facilities locally and train new employees.  The learning curve may lead to a decrease in quality.  As a bus contract is completed in a relatively short period of time, one to two years for a several hundred bus contract, those employees that were hired locally will be laid off at the conclusion of the contract.  New Flyer has a recent experience with the above.  In 2013, New Flyer was awarded a contract by the LA Metro for 550 firm plus 350 option buses.  A determining factor in the contract award was a commitment to hire local workers.  After contract award New Flyer established a 103,646 square foot facility in the Los Angeles area and hired and trained a total of 53 employees to perform final assembly.  This action led to reduction of an equivalent number of employees at New Flyers St. Cloud, MN facility.  The result was a zero gain in total employment.   ",,,,,,,

Dear Sir/Madame:

On behalf of the Board of Directors of the Kentucky Association of Highway Contractors (KAHC), this letter is to advise of this
associations opposition to the U. S. Department of Transportations proposed withdrawal of the ban on utilizing local hiring 
preferences on federal-aid highway and transit projects.  KAHC represent more than 250 highway construction contractors who
are pre-qualified for work on federal-aid projects in Kentucky.  Additionally, KAHC represents approximately 230 associate
members who supply materials and services  to those contractors.  The membership of KAHC performs the majority of the 
federal-aid projects administered by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet.  This work is typically bid through a competitively
bid process. 
 
We believe the change in the proposed policy to provide jobs for residents of specific cities will inhibit the normal ability of 
contractors to provide the particular skills and workforce required to meet the performance standard of projects.  There are
many specialties required in highway construction work that can only be met by having a skilled, mobile work force.  Residency
preferences will limit job opportunities for careers in construction because of the restrictions of mobility.  The workforce must be 
able to be mobile and move to where the work is required without the restriction of residency requirements.  Employers need 
the skilled employees to perform the necessary construction operations of the project efficiently in order to be produce a 
quality project at a competitive price. 

Local hiring preferences will negatively impact competitive bidding.  Local hiring preference may also undermine the needed
safety requirements that are necessary for a safe worker environment.  Mandates from local hiring preferences will make labor
an undefinable factor due to the demand that  the labor come from a largely unknown pool of workers whose skills and
proficiencies are unknown by the contractor.  The use of financial penalties has an adverse impact on competitive bidding. 
No local entity can guarantee the availability of specific skilled employees at a specific time when multiple projects are 
occurring in a locality. As a result, this risk cannot be determined adequately and subsequently included in a bid.  

This proposal for a government entity to exclude qualified individuals from a specific job based on their place of residence is
wrong.  To have to exclude individuals who have the appropriate construction skills for a job simply because of where they 
do not live is simply not right. The detrimental impact to the safety and efficiency of a contractors proven record of operations 
at a competitive price by forcing exclusive mandates on residency is not justified.  We respectfully request that this initiative to 
allow the use of local hiring preferences not be advanced.

Respectfully submitted,

Charles R. Lovorn
Executive Director

For example, there currently are eight large passenger rail rolling stock manufactures and now only four heavy-duty bus manufacturers with permanent facilities in the US; often in rural and economically distressed areas that depend on these jobs
-          Zero-Sum Game  Create Jobs in One Area, Lose them in Another
-          These companies have each invested tens of millions of dollars in their facilities and provided years of worker training to develop the highly skilled manufacturing workforce that is required to build the highly advanced rolling stock technology
-          Most of these companies have made binding commitments to both State and Local governments to achieve employment goals in order to access industrial development funding and tax incentives
-          Local hiring preferences would cause a substantial loss of jobs at the current manufacturing facilities across America by forcing the carbuilders to shutter their plants and move jobs to a new facility for each new procurement.  This is a zero sum game with no net gain in employment.
Impact on Transit Projects
-          Today, transit agencies benefit by not being fully burdened with 100% of the capital investment manufacturers put into their facilities and amortize on multiple projects
-          This proposal will substantially increase the cost of rolling stock procurements, according to some of the manufacturing experts of the industry, since each agency would have to pay 100% of the capital investment on their project
-          The effects of the program would likely reduce the total number of projects that can be implemented because the funds are being used inefficiently, could thus actually lower jobs overall
Please stop trying to ""help the industry"" and instead focus on growing the program overall, through additional funding and financing options that will actually create additional demand and grow orders and thus jobs.

This administration, given what it had to contend with in its early days, should by now understand that our 30-year experiment with ""supply side solutions"" to any of our economic troubles has simply not worked. This proposal if adopted would be only one more unworkable and possibly counterproductive addition to the list of such failures.",,,,,,,

SUMMARY:

The LIUNA Mid-Atlantic Regional Organizing Coalition (hereinafter, MAROC) respectfully submits this comment in support of the proposed rulemaking to permit geographic- based hiring preferences with respect to projects that receive grants from the Department and the Federal Highway Administration. 

MAROC submits the following points for the Departments consideration in support of the proposed initiative:

1.	Local-hiring preferences are necessary within urban areas to promote the employment of local residents in areas like the District of Columbia, where city residents have been traditionally excluded from the construction industry.

2.	Use of local hiring preferences by the District of Columbia has not limited competition in the procurement by DC of building construction.

3.	Local hiring can be carried out in non-discriminatory ways.

4.	Local hiring requirements will not reduce competition because contractors can meet these requirements by signing project labor agreements with local labor organizations.

MAROC agrees with the Departments preliminary assessment that, in ordinary circumstances, geographically-based preferences do not limit competition or raise costs for the government. Rather, they simply allow local governments to leverage federal and state funds into local jobs and economic growth. MAROC and the unions affiliated with the Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA) have long experience with promoting local-resident hiring by offering training and job placement to urban populations that often are excluded from employment in the construction industry. We have seen firsthand that these initiatives do not limit competition because construction contractors from anywhere around the globe easily can make arrangements with organizations like LIUNA to facilitate hiring from local communities. Consequently, these preferences have the entirely salutary effect of concentrating the economic benefits of construction projects within the communities where the projects are located, without reducing competition.

programs be included in the Final Rule and that separate guidance in the Rule be made for
construction and rolling stock contracts.  Construction work be done in a specific location
 where the infrastructure is being built redeveloped. Thus, the ability for local and targeted hire preferences should be permitted with
minimal change to the Rule. However, in rolling stock procurement, it may be financially
untenable to require that the manufacture of the vehicles be conducted in a specific geographic
location. Thus, we urge the Department to establish guidance for a set of factors that must be
attained for states or local governments to use local or geographic preferences for
procurement of rolling stock, such as the size and value of a procurement and local transit
market demand.
The proposed local and targeted hire program makes great strides towards providing more
Americans a Ladder of Opportunity and would improve grantees ability to foster economic
growth and see the full benefit from their investment. Transportation for America strongly
supports the pilot and the proposed changes in the Rule, and ask that that Department include
the changes recommended above that would make the proposal even stronger.  Making these rules stronger will connect the local economy to these rail projects.",,,,,,,

Re:	Docket ID Number DOT-OST-2015-0013, Geographic-Based Hiring Preferences in Administering Federal Awards

Dear Secretary Foxx:

CEMEX USA appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the United States Department of Transportations (U.S. DOTs) notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) concerning geographic-based hiring preferences in administering Federal-aid contracts for highway and transit projects.  CEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high quality products and reliable service to customers and communities in more than 50 countries throughout the world.  Our U.S. network operates in 27 states, where employ approximately 10,000 people in 13 cement plants, 46 active distribution terminals, 79 aggregate quarries and 366 ready-mix concrete plants.

While CEMEX agrees with the U.S. DOT claim that Transportation investments and policies can improve access to jobs, education, and goods movement, while providing construction and operations jobs, we are in strong opposition to the assertion that local and other geographic-based hiring preferences are essential to realizing such economic benefits at level. 

Though we could provide lengthy documentation for the reasons we are opposed to the Rule, we have read the comments from the American Road and Transportation Builder Association (ARTBA), the Highway Materials Group (HMG), the American Concrete Pavement Association (ACPA), and the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) and believe that their comments in opposition accurately reflect our concerns.  We are in full support of their comments opposing the U.S. DOTs pilot program and other regulatory initiatives aimed at geographic-based hiring preferences.  

In closing, CEMEX appreciates the opportunity to comment on U.S. DOTs proposed rule, but we believe that U.S. DOT should focus on voluntary efforts that maximize the economic growth and job-creating opportunities presented by transportation construction. These are not only the best practices in terms of public policy, but also have long served the best interests of taxpayers and all entities responsible for constructing, rehabilitating, and preserving our nations surface transportation infrastructure.

Sincerely

RE: Geographic-Based Hiring Preference in Administering Federal Awards  (Local Hire) 2 CFR Part 1201 [Docket DOTOST20150013] RIN 2105AE38
 
Dear Secretary Foxx:
 
My name is Lois Campbell and I am the Executive Director of The Pennsylvania Interfaith Impact Network (PIIN),  a coalition of over 50 congregations and other faith based organizations committed to work for justice in Pittsburgh and Southwestern Pennsylvania. PIIN is a member of the Gamaliel National network of faith-based organizations.  PIIN supports local hire on federally-funded transportation projects.

The unemployment rate in Pittsburgh is 5.4% but the unemployment rate in the African American community is more than twice that rate.  In some Pittsburgh neighborhoods and surrounding boroughs, the actual jobless rate is as much as 30%.  The lack of access to family sustaining jobs cripples these communities and impacts all aspects of community health.

The current Minority and Women's Hiring Goals (Executive Order 11246) for the Pittsburgh MSA is 6.3% for minorities and 6.9% for women.  They have not changed since 1980 and if regularly updated using the same formula the minority number would rise to 17%.  The women's number is a national number, but our colleagues at Wider Opportunities for Women and several of the tradeswomen's groups are calling for 10% for journey level and 25% for apprenticeship level.

 The largest percent of federal funds coming into our communities, regions, and states comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation.  For every billion dollars of public infrastructure spending, approximately 13,000 jobs are created.  Approximately $373 million of federal money will be used in the Pittsburgh area on transportation projects in FY 2015.  Under current federal regulations, the contracts on these projects cannot include local hire provisions.  If, however, local hire provisions could be applied to the $373 million of federal transportation money coming into the Pittsburgh area, nearly 5000 jobs would be createdmany of them could potentially be held by local residents.  
Between February 2013 and February 2014, Southwestern Pennsylvania lost 5,200 jobs, the biggest loss in percentage terms among the top 40 regions in the country.  Having local hire for a percentage of the career path transportation construction jobs created could make a significant difference in our community. 

 Gamaliel affiliates in Kansas City and St. Louis, for example, secured local hire ordinances on projects that did not receive federal funds. The results have been significant: more people of color and women were actually trained and secured jobs on those cities construction projects. Also, because the ordinances included a reporting requirement, contractors and the city became accountable to the community. 

As the U.S. Department of Transportation considers allowing local hiring preference on federally-funded projects, it should also consider including percentages of those jobs that should be set aside for women and minorities which would lead to real economic security for our community.


Sincerely, 

Lois Campbell

I am a private pilot, operating a small single engine aircraft for personal and business purposes.   

I currently use VOR and GPS navigation systems, with GPS being the more used of the two.  Unfortunately, GPS is a single point of failure system.  A software problem, satellite problem, whether accidental or the result of deliberate attack, can significantly disrupt navigational capability.  No other system currently available has the accuracy and flexibility of GPS.  Modern moving-map navigation systems universally rely on GPS, and if GPS capacity is degraded navigation will have to be done with VOR and paper maps, a system that is less accurate and far more attention-demanding.  

I believe that if eLORAN is implemented, manufacturers will release new navigational systems that utilize GPS and eLORAN signals to provide navigational capability.  Such systems would allow for better accuracy by cross-referencing the two, as well as much greater redundancy if one is disrupted.

Therefore, I strongly urge you to implement an eLORAN system that has equivalent accuracy to GPS-WAAS and at least North American continental coverage.  Better yet would be world-wide coverage.",,,,,,,

(a) A brief description of your application(s) of positioning, navigation, and timing services

I'm a recreational boater who cruises the coast of Maine, and often transits to the Carolinas in the fall and back in the spring.

(b) the positioning, navigation, and/or timing performance required for a complementary PNT capability to support operations during a disruption of GPS that could last for longer than a day, 

My personal safety and peace of mind when boating are quite dependent on accurate GPS positioning and I would greatly appreciate a complimentary system that provided similar accuracy.
My ability to communicate by cell phone and also use cellular for Internet connectivity are also important to my welfare on the boat, and I understand that a complimentary PNT system could help ensure cellular viability during a GPS outage.

(c) availability and coverage area required for a complementary PNT capability, 

My needs would be satisfied by coverage similar to the old LORAN C system.

(d) willingness to equip with an eLoran receiver to reduce or prevent operational and/or economic consequences from a GPS disruption, 

That will depend on cost but I believe that manufacturers will compete to produce reasonable cost eLoran receivers, including integrated GPS/eLoran receivers, if a large market like the U.S. indicates a strong commitment to building the infrastructure.

(e) current and planned availability of e-Loran capable user equipment, 

To the best of my knowledge -- and my work is researching and writing about marine electronics -- current eLoran receivers are expensive and primarily designed to provide accurate timing and for other industrial purposes. But please see question (d).

(f) other non-eLoran PNT technologies or operational procedures, currently available or planned, that could be used during a disruption of GPS for longer than a day.

I'm old enough to have navigated extensively coastwise and offshore without any electronic assistance, and I keep paper charts and the tools to use them on board, but my skills are getting quite rusty.",,,,,,,

By having two systems that utilize a different frequency to transmit data, increases the ""no fail mode"" of the signals to the users.
If anyone wants to jam the GPS signal, although illegal, it will be hard to trace the jamming device if it operates on a random basis and different geographical locations.  To trace or track the device will be time consuming and man power intensive, should there be multiple jamming efforts, the C/A code will be rendered suspect to the users.  Spoofing is another worry, that has been proven in demonstrations by various universities and organizations to lead a ship's electronics to plot a wrong course, same could happen to avionics.
By the addition of the eLoran signal, system integrity is strengthened, both navigation and timing signals will harder to jam or spoof.  Since most of the Loran infrastructure is still intact in the USA, the capital investment will be lower, thus saving money and time of installation to bring the system online.  The certification process will be able to use the UK eLoran data and the FAA NPA certification to bring the system online in a short time, rather than design a brand new system with all the money and studies needed to complete the task.

LORAN had reached nearly the precision of GPS, with equipment that functioned about the same as GPS (the controls on most GPS units were based on LORAN, making the transition to GPS easy) and it offered an alternative to GPS.  This was a ground-based system that seemed less affected by solar activity, periodic downgrades of performance by the military and other factors.  Despite this, the system was shut down.

Here we are, several years later, with the VOR system (a ground-based aviation navigation system for aircraft only) being phased out, leaving ""all of our eggs in one basket"" with GPS.  For aviation, or those on the lakes and seas, it will be GPS or nothing.  Solar activity, accidental or intentional shutdown of the GPS system, or even jamming of the system (the hardware and software is widely available and has already been used to jam GPS in small areas) all can cause havoc for navigation, since this is all we have for marine use, and will soon be all we have for aviation use.  We need redundancy, as well as a ""check and balance"" for GPS.  The combined GPS/eLORAN system would provide not only redundancy, but also potential improved accuracy.

While the exceptional performance of GPS is obvious, there is less awareness of its vulnerability.  Evidence of that is crystal clear from the decision in 2010 to decommission Loran-C, and thereby eliminate the infrastructure needed for eLoran.  All that despite the universally acclaimed report dated Sept 10 2001 from Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, highlighting GPS vulnerability.  Now after all these years a reliable backup, widely and repeatedly advocated, is still not firmly established.  A day of reckoning, denying vital capability for both navigation and timing, could occur at any time.  Cost incurred would completely overwhelm the $190 million ""savings"" over five years estimated by the Office of Management and Budget.

That $190 million figure is likewise dwarfed by funds that would be required to undo the damage inflicted by destroying existing provisions for Loran.  That destruction would expose our failure to act on what we've always known: Reliance on any one single information source vital for safety and security is reckless.

The three step manual process was quite an art because of electronic interference, especially at night, or when operating near base line extensions. However, one good time delay line plus a bearing from the high powered automatic direction finder (ADF) tower on Nantucket Island was much better than dead reckoning alone.

  Five years later, when flying over the same waters, our aircraft were equipped with LORAN C mini-navigators which provided Latitude/Longitude readout and navigational computing, That was a giant leap forward, and I used LORAN C for a quarter century, until the arrival of GPS.

  When the first attempt to shut down LORAN C was made, I argued against it for the reason that the Chinese proved by destroying one of their obsolete satellites: someone might destroy enough GPS satellites to render the system useless. Since LORAN C is now gone, it would be prudent to set up some land based long range navigation system as a backup to GPS. My recommendation would be eLORAN for long range navigation, and we should also retain  some VOR/ILS airways and approaches to permit recovery of aircraft in event of GPS failure.",,,,,,,

Global Positioning System is an excellent positioning system but it has limitations.  These include inadequate integrity (the system can provide data that is in error but is advertised as good) and inadequate availability (easily jammed, inadequate reach to non-line-of-sight locations, etc).  

Further, GPS has become a critical input to a burgeoning array of uses ranging from cellphones to ambulance and fire engine dispatching, vehicle safety, electric power system control, agricultural equipment control, etc, etc.  Thus the impacts of GPS failure are steadily increasing.  I therefore agree with the inferred intent of this inquiry  an complementary alternative is increasingly necessary.

eLoran is an imperfectly defined term.  In general it is a good idea.  It should include the following components:
     - the Loran navigational signal as an alternative positioning independent of GPS.
     - differential GPS signals that provide integrity checks for GPS itself as well as GPS pseudorange corrections for increased precision.  This capability is currently provided in port areas by the US Coast Guard's dGPS system and certainly should be part of the eLoran data stream.
     -  differential Loran is a secondary inclusion.  I believe that the value is less than that of dGPS but it better positions Loran to be a complement to GPS and the marginal cost of inclusion is small.
     - this list might be extended but the data communications capacity of the Loran signal is limited so there is a finite list of features that can be supported.

Coverage should at least be over the entire territory of the United States as well as the harbor/harbor approach zones and territorial seas.  Unlike Loran in its origin, eLoran as a GPS complement should be considered much more than just a maritime navigation system  it should be capable of supporting all mobile platforms.

The current GPS system will soon become the sole means of navigation for aviation after the phasing out of NDB (already obsolete) and VOR systems (relatively obsolete and high maintenance costs).

In aviation this means a critical aspect of flight safety will be dependent on a single system with no redundancy in case of failure. Failure could include natural noise- generating phenomenon, intentional jamming, or technical unexpected satellite failures. Having a single such system without backup for critical functions like aviation presents the possibilities of serious danger. A systemic failure could affect many aircraft simultaneously, unexpectedly and without a means of recovery in adverse weather.

eLoran represents a highly feasible, simple and cost-eefective means of providing a safety backup to the GPS system. A relatively small number of strategically placed transmitters can provide wide coverage on a completely different frequency band, with land based systems to complement the satellite based GPS system. The cost of installation is relatively nominal, especially when compared to existing VOR systems.

Technically speaking, all aircraft currently equipped with GPS systems are already virtually equipped for eLoran. What would be needed is a firmware upgrade (and probably/possibly some minor hardware modification in some cases) to allow an external position input for X and Y coordinates from the external, add-on eLoran receiver, and altitude from the altimeter. Then, the entire existing GPS computer, databases, user interface, etc. can be used as-is without modification. In case of GPS failure, the existing GPS unit could be programmed to switch to the eLoran input, indicate a safety message on the screen, recognize new/different limits or margins, and continue to function using the different input signal. This would provide a high degree of redundancy and safety.

I currently use GPS for aviation navigation. In preparation for upcoming changes, I have equipped the aircraft with 2 GPS units and ADS-B. I have eliminated NDB and have nearly eliminated the use of VOR (to be phased out). I have alos removed two older Loran units. Based on future available technologies, within 5 to 10 years there will be NO backup navigation available during significant IFR conditions.

If commercially available, I would equip my aircraft with one or two (redundant) eLoran external receivers to feed the GPS units with position information, in a manner described above. This would provide complete redundancy at reasonable cost, not impact flying procedures or training, nor change the panel configuration.

The external eLoran should be capable of continuous background operation, with a display available to show its status on the GPS system (minimum available, unavailable). The accuracy should allow at least accuracy for non-precision approaches at a minimum

If implemented the Coast Guard should not be burdened with the operation, development, or funding of the new eLoran system.  This belongs in another agency such as DHS S&T, NPPD, or NIST.

Additionally, the Loran-C system was shut down because it became an orphan.  Funding was limited and it was not upgraded soon enough to make manufacturers want to produce receivers.  GPS evolved quickly and manufacturers soon made that their choice for timing and navigation.  Loran-C never caught up and died on the vine.

What is the incentive for me to buy a GPS/eLoran combination receiver if I am a recreational boater?  After seeing what happened to Loran-C, how long will eLoran be around?

The demonstrated accuracy was: ""according to this box the runway threshold should be right about BLAM here"" (about ten feet).  Demonstrably, this beats the best that GPS could ever do.

GPS is now ""down"" regularly, unable to maintain three 9s; insufficient for air navigation and most particularly completely insufficient for terminal navigation and approach.

This is why most civil aviation aircraft now use Glonass for navigation.

When the Secretary of Transportation and Secretary of Defense both agreed that Loran was not necessary because we have GPS, they shut down the only PNT system that is unjammable, unspoofable, more available, and more accurate then all alternatives; thereby leaving us depending on the superior technology of the Soviet Union for reliable PNT today (idiots).

GPS (Global Positioning System) adds too many values to everyone daily activities, it expands from serving some very specific applications and fields in the past to reach normal people daily activities, but what if GPS suddenly been stopped?, i think with the current givings of watching how the GPS affects the human activities round the clock, a sudden miss-communication will happen not only to the normal people activities, but will reach the infrastructure of the now a days life, as a telecommunication expert i knows that GPS timing used to synchronize too many telecommunications infrastructure, as  an Ex-maritime telecom. and electronics expert it also used to synchronize too many systems like Radars and AIS within the maritime navigation, think of how will be the size of the GPS cut/stop disaster will be?.

The above was a focus on the increasing negative impact of the GPS stop/jammed any time, this very very high severity should be handled correctly, the proposal above of having a complementary Positioning, Navigation and Timing system became a necessity to compensate the rapid increasing severity of the GPS Jammed/Cutting/Stop/errors risk, for my far knowledge the risk is treated according to its impact versus probability, in our risk case here the risk severity/impact is almost reaching the top and still increasing, on the probability side, we witness many cases of jamming/errors of the GPS, for my best knowledge and experience i witness myself a case when the AIS system positioned two ships in Damman port berths having a wrong position over the berth land, imagine if this happened again when a ship reaches the port channel and having a wrong GPS data!! this of course happens in sea and we have no records of it, not only in commercial applications but also military, what if the fires navigated over wrong GPS info., this for sure is a disaster and unforgivable errors and mistakes.

Based on the above, I fully agree with a Complementary Positioning, Navigation and Timing system.

As a proposal, in the past decades we have witness the Loran-C wonderful service, for my best knowledge as Ex-expert in Saudi Arabia - SEA Ports Authority (SEAPA), i witness myself the importance of that system till now a days, and how it best served the US forces and allies during the first Iraqi War in the early 90's and still survived as a backup in the second one, the responsible at SEAPA and also the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF) was fully pleased of such level of service. Now E-loran became more accurate than the Loran-C and its accuracy almost reaches the GPS accuracy, and expected to compete it. In Saudi Arabia, the Loran-C system still broadcast and i know they will going to upgrade.

For the United States, I believe having the E-loran as complementary system to GPS over the whole territory is something inevitable for the sake of honesty and transparency, and a backup that is necessary to people daily activities which suffers the hidden errors of GPS to public and a possible disaster of GPS Stop/Jammed, Saudi Arabia Still believes in Loran-C and planning to migrating to E-loran, other countries migrated already, some others are following the steps, for the sake of the US citizens, the United States should follow the migration steps especially when the cost margin with E-loran calculations are almost nothing comparing the Loran-C previous operations cost.

Based on the above, i highly recommend the Eloran as a complementary positioning, navigation and timing system to GPS.

Such occurrences constitute a significant safety hazard.

We used to rely on LORAN as a fallback RNAV system.  There are very few common failure modes between GPS and LORAN or eLORAN, which makes eLORAN an ideal secondary system.

I strongly support the development of eLORAN and consider it essential.",,,,,,,

Accordingly, ""eLoran"" (or any other Loran) should now be permanently removed from any further consideration for practical use, and relegated to the list of obsolete, poorly functioning, and unnecessarily expensive concepts, along side MLS, PAR/GCA, REGAL, GEE, DECCA, TACAN, and scores of other ancient NAV ideas, that were once considered potentially useful, but were unworkable at affordable cost, or pushed the limits of the laws of physics and electromagnetism.

Instead, all future NAV and PNT should be based on good clocks, related to multi-constellation GNSS, filtered as needed with inertial, while using augmentation means as necessary, with a variety of other better methods, used to attain the needed degrees of robustness (e.g., accuracy, integrity, and availability). Examples include multi-constellation GNSS networked with GBAS [e.g., in multi-lateration pseudolite configurations], and use of backup residual radio aids (e.g., DMEs) in multi-sensor NAV systems (like RNP capable FMS) for at least the next several decades (until GBAS is globally deployed to replace ILS, and backup robust multi-lateration is available from those GBAS facilities).

The author of this comment has been involved in the discipline of Radio Aids to Navigation for the whole of his professional career. Engineering HF, VHF & UHF Radio Direction Finding systems in the 1950s led to design improvements of the Instrument Landing System and the design of the Wide Aperture Doppler VHF Omnidirectional Range.  His interest in using the experimental single station Loran-C system in the early 1960s prompted the development of radio signal retransmission systems for positioning of remote objects.  As Loran-C stations were installed across the United States and other countries; it became the radionavigation system of choice.  In addition the stability of groundwave radio propagation and the signal format of the Loran-C system enabled the transmission and dissemination of precise time nationwide to meet the most stringent requirements of the developing communication technology. Later precise time became the backbone of the US airways navigation. 

The GPS project that was initiated in 1973 became operational in 1995 providing a positioning and navigation resource of higher accuracy and wider coverage than Loran-C and also provided the transmission of precise time.  For this reason, in May 2009, President Obama declared Loran-C obsolete and announced plans to terminate the Coast Guard provided service.  While this decision may have appeared logical it did not address the essential need for continuity of service in the event of GPS denial.

Since its inception, the vulnerability of GPS to natural and man-made interference, both unintentional and intentional has been known but generally ignored.  Without the Loran-C stations in the event of an interruption of GPS service continuity of precise time would no longer be guaranteed leading to the potential breakdown of the United States vital infrastructure. Further reliance upon a single source for navigation violates the basic requirement for a backup in the event of denial of the primary system.

Loran-C with its restructured format eLoran is the only available nationwide candidate for a back-up to GPS.  It is difficult to jam and while not immune to interference and denial, eLoran has the advantage in the dissimilarity to GPS of frequency of operation, modes of propagation and signal format.  Together the probability of simultaneous denial of both systems is highly unlikely.

The recommendation of this author is to move ahead with the implementation of eLoran without delay to strengthen the security of the United States infrastructure.   The cost of this insurance is dwarfed by the consequences of GPS signal unavailability.

I utilized LORAN-C for VFR navigation back before GPS was available.  I was very impressed with its capability back then, as I could even determine my position while on the ground.  These days, as a retired federal air traffic controller, I simply utilize GPS for land-based navigation in my car. 

With technology, there are unforeseen problems...even by the brightest minds.  Mode S secondary radar comes to mind.  The smart folks at MIT didn't expect the ""Terra P4 problem.""  It made legacy transponders invisible to the their new interrogation format.  It wasn't supposed to, but it happened.  I experienced that personally.  Engineers are still dealing with that issue to this day.  

With complex technology there are invariably latent errors that exist, yet rarely surface, except, incredibly, at the most inopportune time.  Radar data processing comes to mind, wherein, at times, the only radar data that is available is *not* processed to the air traffic controller's display.  An example of that was AAL77, the 9/11 Pentagon aircraft.  It wasn't lost on radar as probably most everyone still thinks...it simply wasn't displayed on the controller's display at Indianapolis ARTCC (see TomLusch.com if you're interested).  

Also, with fragile complex technology, there are inevitably those who will learn how to take advantage of disrupting this technology, just because they can.  And then there are those who will do it with the most evil of intentions.  Imagine a terrorist launching a weather balloon with a transmitter designed to jam the weak GPS signals.  Imagine everything being dependent upon those weak GPS signals, and no backup.  It makes no sense whatsoever for us to be this vulnerable.  We have too much at stake.  We need to guard against those who disrupt society.  We need to make it so they are powerless to do so.  

As a minimum, the coverage area required for a complementary PNT capability would be over the United States of America.  Each country can build their own backup system.  Utilizing islands for sites to erect antennas to support ocean travel should be investigated.  Possibly we could cover most of the world?  

When I was an active general aviation pilot, I always strived to equip myself with technology that could be put to use in an immediate nature, such that it would turn a very bad situation into simply an inconvenience.  That backup handheld radio made all the difference in the world to me on a cross-country flight wherein I encountered a complete charging system failure.  I would like to see a future disruption of the GPS system be merely an inconvenience.  

As a retired individual, I have no current or planned use of eLoran equipment.  Yet, if eLoran becomes adopted, and my smartphone would be capable of including a eLoran receiver within it, I'd likely upgrade.  Ultimately, I desire a redundant, terrestrial-based system available for all relying on satellite based navigation.  

If we keep all of our eggs in the orbital basket, expect chaos with a major GPS disruption.  Our ubiquitous GPS system permeates every aspect of our culture now, and it would be an incredible hardship for society to lose this capability...even for a day.  To simply be able to fallback, utilizing a terrestrial navigation system, while dealing with a satellite disruption, would be optimum for society.  

Those who have made past short-sighted decisions to not have a suitable backup capability available will not be looked upon fondly by historians should our GPS system be disrupted in a major way.  

I'm delighted to see this issue discussed.  For the good of our country, implement a backup system that is not totally space based.  eLoran is the obvious choice, as it is wide-area, difficult to jam, proven, and completely non-dependent upon satellites.

As a service provider of Radio Frequency Interference resolution it is a challenge to provide high quality service to customers when their relied upon GPS services are disrupted and they have no other means to sustain operations until the problem is resolved. Although we strive to tackle any radio interference disruptions to the maximum extent and eliminate disruptions immediately the variables and circumstances of such disruptions are exponentially wide and in some cases final resolution to eliminate signal disruptions can take unacceptable length of time.

With the possibility of a second signal independent PNT service that can sustain and provide users a seamless non-disruptive environment it will create the opportunities to better investigate the initial disruptions to primary PNT services and offer greater potentially resolution responses. If the results of this initiative show solid support for the eLoran implementation it would have positive effects in many other services as well.  Looking forward to an exciting time ahead.

backup for GPS. The policy decision, eLoran as national backup, was reached at that NPEC
meeting, with implementation assigned to DOT and DHS. The formal announcement was made
in a press release by DHS on 8 February 2008 (Appendix B).

IAT Conclusions and Major Recommendation (see report charts 4, 10, 37, and 38):
 Reasonable assurance of national PNT availability is prudent and responsible policy,
needed for ubiquitous, critical safety of life and national and economic security, as well
as quality of life, applications dependent upon GPS-based PNT.
 eLoran is the only cost-effective backup for national needs; it is completely interoperable
with and independent of GPS, with different propagation and failure mechanisms, plus
significantly superior robustness to radio frequency interference and jamming. It is a
seamless backup, and its use will deter threats to US national and economic security by
disrupting (jamming) GPS reception.
 The US Government policy decision is needed to motivate users to equip and to
demonstrate continued leadership internationally.

Thus, the IAT unanimously recommends that the U.S. Government complete the eLoran
upgrade and commit to eLoran as the national backup to GPS for 20 years.

Creating a redundant system which can provide alternate sources of PNTS is a reasonable investment, as more-and-more systems have become increasingly dependent on GPS services to provide that critical communications.  

Having served in law enforcement and worked in and around these issues for decades, I understand the public safety requirements to ensure continuity of emergency services communications.  As a former private pilot, aircraft mechanic Naval Flight Officer, and Naval Air Traffic Control Officer, I understand the life-critical information provided in FAA concepts of operations which are often single-threaded back to GPS.

GPS is a wonderful tool.  However, because of the trillions of dollars might be lost during constellation failures, which could be natural, or manmade, such an investment is entirely reasonably justified in eLoran.

Foliage is interested in implementing eLoran services for PNT into several product development efforts that we perform for 
our clients. We also would be interested in the wide area low bit-rate data-channel capabilities that eLoran could provide if 
these services were available publicly. We believe that eLoran provides the necessary timing and navigation accuracy for 
our applications and we would be interested in integrating mass market eLoran receiver technology into our client's products.

Since the mid 1970âs during my many years as head of aircraft navigation for the navy and during my subsequent years at the Institute for Defense Analyses, I have always  maintained a need for a backup to GPS. This requirement goes back to my flight test years for the navy and my conversations with Navy Captain Philip Van Horn Weems.  Always have a backup is not an idle comment relative to survival.  We are at a critical juncture in the pursuit of safe navigation in the air, in space, on land and on the seas. Accurate time is a dominant requirement for navigation and E-LORAN provides that to safeguard from denial of GPS.  I do not think the draft document clearly makes the point about accurate time availability.  This point about accurate time needs to be repeated several times in the document to emphasize the national criticality.  Maybe, I missed the subject of secure money transfer using POSITIME. However,  the encoding of accurate position and time for financial transfer purposes should be a national requirement.
 
As noted in the Spring 2015 Edition vol 62 of the Navigation Journal of the Institute of Navigation Page 83 titled ""Railway Track Irregularity Measuring by GNSS/INS Integration"" there is a critical requirement for fast train railroad tracks to be relatively aligned to an accuracy of 1mm. I assume there is also an accuracy for high speed roads.  Nowhere in the draft proposal are these requirements discussed.  I recommend a change to the draft in the respective parts of the draft relative to the use of E-LORAN.

A single satellite system is quickly becoming the sole means of acquiring a position for many navigators on many ships. A back up system would give the navigator a secondary means of acquiring a fix while at sea. It could also act a secondary or back up system to the countless pieces of bridge equipment dependent on a constant position feed to function. It would also provide a system which is not vulnerable to the same types of interference and potential sabotage which threaten GPS.

Linn","Roth","Madison","WI","53705","United States",,,,,,,"As someone who was deeply involved in the efforts to continue and modernize Loran and, as the owner of a company
that specialized in spread-spectrum radios and Loran receivers, I might provide a slightly different perspective to the 
governments solicitation for comments on the potential creation of an eLoran system as a national backup to GPS.

First, let me state that the governments history regarding radionavigation policy and the Loran system is embarrassing 
at best and dangerous at worst.  In that condemnation, I include all parties involved, i.e. the Departments of Transportation 
and Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration and the US Coast Guard.  As anyone who was involved in 
radionavigation since about 1990 knows, the government was virtually dysfunctional in developing, coordinating, and 
implementing a cohesive, comprehensive, national radionavigation policy and system.  For example, the FAA and USCG 
could barely speak to one another, let alone cooperate on a national level (e.g. they developed two different systems, 
WAAS and the marine radiobeacon DGPS, that fundamentally did the same thing, and astonishingly, the FAA actually 
advocated sole means GPS for a considerable period of time).  The DOT regularly vacillated on Loran continuation,
termination, and enhancement, could not produce a credible Federal Radionavigation Plan, and certainly could not facilitate 
cooperation between the FAA and USCG, which were under its aegis during that time.  With regard to DHS, it did not - from 
its inception -understand the fundamental importance of providing a national GPS backup for time and frequency applications,
and I am not sure they are there yet today.

Second, let me state that nothing much has fundamentally changed over the last 15  20 years except in two important areas:
1) our GPS dependence, hence our vulnerability to GPS disruption, has grown; and 2) Loran has continued to develop even 
more capabilities as a GPS backup.  Briefly, eLoran can now provide navigation, positioning, time, frequency, and secure 
messaging.  In addition, eLoran is practically unjammable and can penetrate buildings, thereby providing an indoor time and 
frequency source.  So, in essence, eLoran is the ideal complement to GPS in nearly all critical aspects of the national 
infrastructure and can operate independently or in an integrated system as the individual application demands.

Yet, here we are in 2015, and the government is once again soliciting input on whether we need a GPS backup and if eLoran 
fits the bill.  In 1999, I published an article, The Case for Loran, that outlined the fundamental reasons why GPS needed a 
backup and why Loran was the best system to complement GPS in the national infrastructure.   In the article, I tried to be 
rational and objective, and made the argument that Loran really should be an essential part of the national infrastructure and 
that a strong national infrastructure required a GPS backup.  I failed.  So, Ill change tactics now and be blunt: the US (and 
every other first world nation) is crazy if it does not have a system to backup GPS (or their own satellite system).

I am retired now, and must have something better to do, so let me get to my final point.  If the US government decides to 
implement an eLoran system, it really needs to do so in a complete and coordinated manner that not only meets the technical 
requirements necessary but also assures manufacturers that a long term market will truly be established.  Only then will 
people be willing to risk their own funds and efforts to develop and evolve eLoran receivers and antennas.  I know of what I 
speak.  I actually decided to sell my companys spread spectrum radio product line because I believed what the government 
was telling me at the time, to wit, that Loran would be continued.  Thats why I am retired.

Given the abysmal history of the government with regard to Loran and radionavigation policy, I would also make a final plea 
to those in the government now tasked to decide the fate of eLoran.   Your actions will have consequences, potentially of 
enormous significance.  It is time for every department, agency, and individual involved in this decision to have the courage 
and integrity to put the countrys needs first, not sinecures, interagency budgets or rivalries, or political concerns.

It will also greatly help the nationâs PNT architecture meet the 2013 PPD-21 requirement of being ââ¦secure and able to withstand and rapidly recover from attacks.â

We urge the government to move forward and execute the eLoran project as soon as possible to reduce the on-going risk to the Emergency Services sector.

As a sailor and aviator I have depended on a variety of navigation systems over the years, none of which have the accuracy of GPS.  The maritime and aviation industries depend on GPS for navigation.  We cannot go back to depending on VOR in aviation, or radar on board ships, as primary navigation methods.  They are too inaccurate and will reduce the throughput of aircraft which the FAA system can control, and of ships which vessel traffic systems can monitor - all of which which will harm the U.S. economy.  Utilities, cellular networks, and computer systems rely on GPS technology.  Hospitals are so technology-reliant that lives will be lost if the GPS system fails or is degraded, without a seamless backup/switchover system in place.  At a cost of $37M per year, eLoran is that cost-effective backup system.  It does not require large financial outlays for new equipment or costly upgrades by companies and individuals which currently depend on GPS.  

We cannot afford a single-point failure to degrade the technology upon which we rely for so many critical functions of daily life.  Making eLoran the official backup to GPS systems is a no-brainer!!

Based on previous publication in 2006 IEEE MILCOM Homeland Security session paper, An Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Intentional Interference to eLORAN, coauthors James Chadwick and I have objectively shown that eLORAN can adequately protect national PNT and Synchronization (PNTS) service for all critical infra-structure sectors that weak GNSS signals could no longer support in fast-faced global economical and geo-political changes.  Around the world, GNSS signals have been repeatedly interfered, jammed and even spoofed. 
Besides the facts that eLORANs strong signal will mitigate unintentional GNSS interference and deter intentional GNSS jamming and spoofing attempts, the complementary eLORAN PNTS solution could provide at least two critical future economy-boosting killer applications that the current single-point of failure GNSS-only PNTS solution could not usher in.
1.	Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)
Without complementary backup or joint navigation solution to GNSS, the commercial UAS industry, government aviation safety and homeland security authorities may not be able to put a safe and economically viable UAS integration architecture together in National Air Space (NAS).  Interruption of GNSS-based geo-fencing and no-fly-zone enforcement is more likely unless GNSS interference, jamming, and spoofing are mitigated by complementary and robust PNTS solution for which eLORAN is the most viable solution, as eLORAN antenna and receivers are cost-effectively integrated in commercial low-altitude UAS navigation system.  eLORAN is likely to provide robust ADS-B and collision avoidance solution.
2.	Integrity solution for e-commerce, including Internet-of-Things and Smart Power Grid solutions

In next decade and later, the proliferation of multi-national GNSS constellation (U.S., EU, Russia, China, India, Japan, and other regional GNSS augmentation systems) is likely to push GNSS chip and receiver makers to acquire and track all available GNSS signals to gain global market share where Intelligent Transportation Systems, Ubiquitous Location-based Service (including indoor) Internet-of-Things and Smart Power Grid will represent only some of the most critical economy and safety applications that require Integrity and Continuity of service that are supposed to be certified by GNSS service providing states.  However, as shown in several historical signal anomaly (e.g., Evil-waveform) in GPS and erroneous ephemeris broadcast by GLONAS, there have been single and multiple GNSS system failure modes that modernized GNSS receivers will try to detect, isolate, and mitigate by Advanced-Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (A-RAIM) algorithm.  However, A-RAIM is facing a new challenge as the number of satellites in view are rapidly increasing and constellation-wide failure mode is not necessarily zero that A-RAIM cannot detect.  By having eLORAN observables into a new RAIM algorithm (to be developed), those users under eLORAN coverage, will be able to have a higher integrity and continuity even when any GNSS constellation accidently exhibit multiple SV failure mode and/or inter-constellation time offset bias may not be accurate.

I am currently the Executive Director of the Wolf Aviation Fund and I have previously supported the continuation of Loran and the adoption of eLoran as an extremely important backup for the satellite based system now in use by General Aviation users for navigation.

By way of background I have training and experience in electrical engineering and an MBA with a concentration in Management Information Systems from the UCLA Anderson School of Management.  I am a 3,500 hour general aviation pilot and use GPS now and have used Loran in the past until it was discontinued.  I have flown as an instrument rated pilot and as a certified flight instructor.

I am also a founder of the Southern California Airspace Users Working Group (SCAUWG), which set the pattern for the involvement of airspace users and their organizations as stakeholders in the development of proposals for modifying or defining airspace boundaries, procedures, and rules.  The SCAUWG white paper on Reclassification which I authored became our group's official comments as well as the basis for those of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association during the national Reclassification of airspace in the 80's. Most of the recommendations were accepted by FAA in the final Reclassification effort and those procedures are still in effect.  Our work also led to the development of the Los Angeles Class B VFR Corridor routes and procedures.

Our satellite based system is quite vulnerable to disruption or failure.  Precipitating events could include a massive solar coronal ejection that damages satellites, a faulty software upload that leads to system failure (this was the cause of a major telephone system blackout in the Northeast a number of years ago), hostile manupulation of satellite programs, anti-satellite warfare by a technically capable belligerent nation, or widespread broadcast of faulty signals by those bent on harming our nation's air transportation system.

General aviation aircraft, pilots, and passengers are especially vulnerable because the only backups currently commonly available are the VOR and related systems, which are being phased out.  In addition they do not function at low altitudes in many parts of the country as does GPS.

In addition to my regular work for the Wolf Aviation Fund I serve on the boards of the Air Care Alliance and the Recreational Aviation Foundation.

The Air Care Alliance is the umbrella group for more than 70 volunteer pilot and other volunteer based charitable flight organizations whose members fly patients for care, medical supplies, organs for transplant, observers for environmental and conservation support purposes, veterans for treatment, disaster relief, and many other charitable purposes.  Many of these flights are at low altitudes in remote and rural areas of from them to cities with central hospitals, or in remote areas with difficult terrain.  Thus they are currently dependent on GPS and loss of that capability could prove very dangerous for flights in progress, especially in instrument conditions.

Likewise for the Recreational Aviation Foundation member pilots and their passengers and for others flying into the backcountry of Alaska or the mountain and Southwestern states in the lower 48.  Current ground based navigation facilities are very often unusable and GPS has become essential.  A ground based backup system suitable for general aviation is sorely needed.

The airlines have additional navigation systems available in case of GPS failure, but these systems are impractical and unaffordable for most general aviation users.

A ground based wide area navigation system would provide essential navigation capabilities for general aviation and many other users, and provide additional redundancy for the airlines and the military users.

Technically the problem is easy for navigation receiver manufacturers.  New units could use much of the same circuitry, logic, and displays as used for GPS, and much of the same database management and update technology.  New units could be manufactured with the additional receiver circuits.  Older units could be retrofitted to accept input from auxiliary eLoran receiving devices by the use of adapters and updated code.

Such solutions have been under implementation in other countries and are needed here in the United States as soon as possible.   With so many GA aircraft upgrading to ADS-B out technology, this is a great time for the installation of eLoran capability at the same time.

I strongly support the development of eLoran capability and urge rapid adoption of a technically excellent and affordable solution for general aviation users.

The U.S.'s GPS has become a integral part of our national critical infrastructure and requires protection. Where GPS is space-based and thus lacks any ground-based or self-defensive capabilities we must have an effective and ready to use solution as an alternative. The eLoran system offers a robust backup/alternative system that can continue many services during a GPS outage. The eLoran system is based on a well established and proven design. This solution can provide additional options such as partnering with GPS to expand capabilities and provide an immediate fail over long range navigation system for ships and aircraft. 

Additionally, when one compares the cost of building, launching and maintaining a single GPS satellite and the greater cost to keep an entire constellation in proper orbits, it is a highly expensive solution. When one satellite stops normal functioning, or has used up its fuel reserves via repositioning, there is a end to end replacement expectation of over $250 million (http://www.globalcomsatphone.com/hughesnet/satellite/costs.html). There is a life expectancy of 6-10 years per satellite. An entire U.S. eLoran coverage solution, however, could be established for possible cost of $750 million, and would provide 20+ years of service per station. This could support Hawaii, Alaska, North and Central America and the Caribbean. 

Like several others, I have significant career experience supporting the maintenance and improvement of Loran-C; particularly in the aviation sector. As a former U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Officer who directly worked with both Loran-C and GPS, I envision this system as best and most effective alternative for a multi-mode PNT. 

I am fully on board with this system!

I have been a sailboat operator for much of the last 35 years, cruising in inland waters, coastal ocean waters, and on the high seas.  My first electronic navigation system was Loran and I gradually changed to use GPS since I sailed beyond the range of US Loran systems.

Assuming the price of eLoran receivers was reasonable (in the $200 range) I would like to have that option for navigation in addition to GPS.  As a sailor I always prefer to have redundant systems aboard and the accuracy of Loran has always be excellent when trying to find anchorages, enter harbors, or find a fishing spot that proved productive a week earlier.

I support the Government's intention to develop and field an Enhanced Loran system.",,,,,,,

But, resurrecting
 the old LORAN C stations would be costly since they've not been maintained for four or five years. The trained personnel 
who once kept the stations running and maintained are retired or need ""refresher training"" if such a thing is possible. The 
system would only be available in U.S., not world-wide as GPS is.

What companies make a reasonably priced LORAN C receiver these days? GPS equipment is readily available and cheap,
with prices measured in only a couple of hundred dollars as a consumer product. The eLoran concept uses some of GPS 
capability so if GPS goes down does that mean eLoran would suffer, or go down, too?  LORAN C by itself has ""about"" one 
tenth to quarter mile accuracy whereas GPS accuracy is measured in feet.

Industry presently uses GPS for timing purposes. If LORAN C or eLoran were to be resurrected, would industry manufacture 
back up timing receivers for power utilities, cell phones, banking, and any other industry that needs precision timing? 

LORAN C is dead. It served its purpose once upon a time. Let it rest in peace. ",,,,,,,

The merits of GPS need no defense; when it is good, it is very very good and it has transformed society's expectations of location-based services such as navigation and situational awareness, on the street, on roads, or on the water.

However, the first rule of Seamanship is to never rely upon only one source of navigation and positioning information. Even setting aside willful jamming, GPS signals are vulnerable to ionospheric disturbances and cannot provide reliable signal coverage in dense urban canyons because the signals require line-of-sight to enough GPS satellites. 

eLoran is an *excellent* system to pair with GPS because its weaknesses are highly uncorrelated with GPS. eLoran is a VLF signal at 100KHz transmitted at very high power. That makes it a ground-wave signal which is extremely robust in the face of interference, natural or intentional. It also penetrates buildings quite easily, even into basements in many cases. While the original Loran-C system was not suitable for this purpose, the updated eLoran signal and station infrastructure is highly accurate and extremely stable, quite suitable for PNT purposes. It also carries additional information which can include DGPS corrections.

Even ancient Loran-C receivers delivered outstanding repeatability of positions (""get me back to *here*"") even if the accuracy was well below that of GPS (""meet me on the other side of the world at this Lat/Lon""). Modern eLoran receivers apply the signal processing concepts developed for GPS recievers that use ""all satellites in view"" to use ""all chains in view"" to produce highly accurate positions maintaining excellent repeatabiility. 

Loran-C was already used as a timing source for communications systems before the availability of GPS timing and a combined system will again provide the best of both worlds - outstanding precision and stability and immunity from interference or denial.

We have needed a parallel PNT system for a long time now, and we were on the verge of getting eLoran when the conversion process was aborted for reasons still not adequately explained. It is high time to finish conversion, reconstruction, and deployment of an eLoran network for at least CONUS and interoperable with all the other eLoran systems being deployed worldwide. This will dramatically reduce a strategic vulnerability that currently exists because we are extremely reliant on GPS for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing signals that our modern world has come to rely upon.

Please move forward aggressively on getting an eLoran system deployed and operational as soon as possible.

Thank you.

Having been involved in the previous US eLoran engineering effort I offer the following suggestion: don't just duplicate the eLoran system from 10 years ago (or what is currently operating in Europe) but take the time to REALLY update the 1950's concept to today's technology and modern signal processing concepts. The prior US effort included improved transmitter hardware and FPGA-based receivers, but stuck with the 1950's pulse shape, groups, chains, rates, phase codes, dual rating, blanking, etc., all to maintain backwards compatibility; even the data channel methods, Eurofix and 9-th Pulse, were add-ons so as to minimally impact the navigation performance of the 1950's system. Take advantage of Loran being turned off in the US; drop the backwards compatibility requirement and develop a 21st century, high performance, groundwave, 100 kHz navigation/communications system.

eLoran is too complicated, too complex and too costly. I do not believe the DOT can pull it off. This notice is 7 years after the ""aha moment"" of realizing we should have a backup.

If the U.S. does not move on establishing it's participation in eLoran, by the end of the year, countries in Europe which now very successfully participate in eLoran and D-eloran as a SUCCESSFUL back up to GNSS, intend to terminate the service,

All studies indicate that eLoran is the only viable backup to GNSS in the areas where eLoran exists and at an accuracy comparable to GNSS.

eLoran due to it's high power and much lower frequency (MF) is very difficult to jam.

eLoran in addition provides a cellular system timing source when GNSS is jammed, penetration deep into urban canyons, even beneath the waves for those who need it there & by the way, why is South Korea installing an eLoran chain? Could it be that North Korea is jamming the South Korean GNSS signals?

The U.S. must take the lead in the global effort to re-establish this invaluable adjunct to GNSS.

-Significant interest in terrestrial LF PNT solutions exists in our own country and worldwide.
-Nautel has developed modern, solid-state terrestrial LF PNT transmission solutions to address the worldwide opportunity
-A positive terrestrial LF PNT decision in the US will help influence international demand creating opportunity for Nautel Maine, its employees and our domestic suppliers.
-In addition a positive decision will help our country further its leadership in this strategic technological sector.
 
Growing worldwide terrestrial LF PNT interest:

Extensive market research has been undertaken by Nautel and our Value Added Reseller (VAR) partner, UrsaNav Inc, which confirms both US and worldwide interest in a modernized ground based, terrestrial LF PNT network to complement and back-up the critical satellite based PNT network. We expect that numerous other responses will highlight the growing list of US and worldwide experts, government officials, agencies, departments and industry leaders who have publically commented on the need for a modernized ground based, terrestrial PNT network.  

 Nautel Maine: Modern LF PNT ready solutions: 

In response to this emerging demand, Nautel has developed a new series of, solid-state transmitters, designed to be a critical part of LF Position, Navigation, Timing and Data (PNT&D) system which could include LORAN and/or eLORAN. These state-of-the-art LF PNT&D transmitters utilize a patented pulse power recovery technique to provide outstanding efficiency, significantly reduced size and weight, greatly reduced operational costs and a future proof design to allow modernization as the system is further developed. 

Economic implications of a positive decision

Nautel Maine Inc.s fully integrated Bangor Maine facility is well positioned to manufacture, test and support all requirements for these US and worldwide transmitter deployments. Our local supply network as well as our suppliers in other areas of the United States would benefit greatly from the opportunity which would be presented should a LF Position, Navigation, Timing and Data (PNT&D) system be deployed in the United States.

Export and technological implications of a positive decision

Nautel and our VAR, UrsaNav Inc. continue to market, discuss and demonstrate this technology in the United States and throughout the world. We have ongoing international sales commitments, ever increasing interest in both the United States and internationally to discuss the many advantages of a complimentary LF PNT system as more countries are concerned about the real threat to their critical infrastructure and defense with their sole dependence on a satellite based PNT system. It is worthwhile to note the importance that the world attaches to technology decisions made in the United States. Although the rest of the world is already moving to implement Complementary Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Capabilities, a positive decision in the US would create an increased momentum. This should offer significant opportunity to the PNT industry in this country and could position the US once again as the leader in this field.
	
Nautel Maine Inc. thanks you for the opportunity to provide our comments on this very important docket item. We trust that a positive outcome will result, ensuring a Complementary Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Capability is implemented to protect the critical infrastructure sectors and defense systems of the United States. Please be assured that Nautel Maine Inc.s more than 30 full time, experienced and highly trained fabricators, assemblers, electrical test and support personnel as well as our local, state, and U.S. suppliers and contractors are up to the challenge of building the technology needed for this resilient, wide area and terrestrial PNT system.

Since 2001, the importance of Position Navigation and Timing (PNT), a role filled by GPS. to our critical infrastructure has just increased. The need for a backup system to protect our critical infrastructure should no longer be an argument; rather the discussion should be on when, and how.

eLoran has been shown to be a fully capable and independent backup system to GPS. As someone who worked on developing eLoran in 2002-2008 I am a big proponent; however, I think that the best solution now is a more generic and encompassing R-Mode (ranging mode) system with Alternative PNT (APNT) receivers that can range off of eLoran, DGPS, and AIS signals. Such a system would leverage the existing worldwide investment in MF DGPS and VHF AIS transmitters and antennas and reduce the number of eLoran towers needing to be built thus bringing the system online more quickly and at lower cost. This concept has been investigated and shown to be feasible in a study that Alion conducted as part of the European ACCSEAS Project. The final report can be found online at http://www.accseas.eu/publications/r-mode-feasibility-study/.

An APNT receiver would be able to seamlessly switch between GPS and APNT modes during the loss of GPS and back again, with no loss to navigational integrity or action on the part of the user. This concept was also demonstrated as part of the ACCSEA project.

Spectracom serves a large customer base requiring precise positioning, navigation, timing and frequency references for critical operations.  The sectors we serve include military, aerospace, financial services, datacenters, telecom networks, public safety and scientific/industrial instrumentation.  

Many of our products contain GPS receivers to provide precision PNT.  However, the limitations of GPS are well known and becoming a growing concern to our customers  a weak signal that is easily jammed by either intentional or unintentional sources, and the lack of availability in shadowed or indoors environments.  

We see eLoran as being an excellent alternative to GPS because of its true diverse nature  literally at the other end of the spectrum:
	Long wave vs.  microwave radio propagation
	Terrestrial vs. space-based transmission source
	High power (megawatt) vs. low power (<100 watt) transmitter

By providing precise positioning, UTC timing, and a stable frequency reference, eLoran is analogous to GPS and therefore is easy to interface with existing GPS systems. 

Though eLoran does not provide the full worldwide coverage a Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) does, the commitments from Europe, Asia and the Middle East to support eLoran provides the foundation for sufficient coverage in the developed world if the United States joins in.  Moreover, the areas of the world uncovered by eLoran are less susceptible to GPS denial and as the threat changes, can be filled in after the USA demonstrates its support.

No one solution has proven to fulfill all the needs for a robust PNT solution, but the complementary GPS-eLoran systems along with other technologies will provide the resiliency so greatly needed for PNT critical operations.

The GPS however is a very fragile system that there is too high a dependence. An interruption in the availability of GPS can easily lead to significant economic and safety of life problems. A terrestrial based radio navigation system backup is necessary and the most suited to fill this role is eLoran.

I have been involved in telecommunication synchronization for more than 25 years and have used a mix of Loran-C and GPS to maintain highly accurate time and frequency. Using Loran-C it was possible to realize phase synchronization on the order of 1us over a distance of more than 1,000 miles from a Loran-C transmitter. The use of a GPS and Loran mix provided redundancy and integrity monitoring and allowed the ability to satisfy extremely high system availability requirements. While Loran-C worked well in telecommunication applications the enhancements made available in eLoran would significantly improve its usefulness in time and frequency (not to mention navigation) applications.

One of the most significant problems of GPS (or GNSS) is the very weak signal received at the Earths surface making it easy to jam. I have experienced many cases of un-intentional and intentional jamming of GPS ranging from broadcast station harmonics to Personal Privacy devices sold on the Internet to prevent GPS tracking of individuals.

The ease in which GPS can be jammed and the potential impacts make the reliance on this single system a potential terrorist target. eLoran on the other hand, given the high transmit power and low carrier frequency makes jamming a very difficult proposition.

The United Stated federal radio navigation policy needs to include a truly redundant alternative to the GPS. eLoran in my opinion would be the best solution as it is low cost, has a proven reliability, is highly accurate and compliments the weaknesses of the GPS (i.e. is truly redundant).

Other adversaries, such as Iran and North Korea, will soon have the same anti-satellite technology as the Chinese. Our GPS system is very seriously at risk. 

In the world of technology, you always use completely different technology as your backup. That is a well proven backup best practice. Putting more satellites in orbit as a supposed backup to destroyed satellites is making the backup just as much at risk as the primary group. If your primary electronic navigation system is satellite-based, then the best mode of reliable, accurate backup electronic navigation in an international confrontation should be terrestrially based.

The virtues of using eLoran as a complimentary solution to GPS for critical PNT applications was and is a no-brainer. The liabilities of each of the two methods almost perfectly align with the strengths of the other. Whats more, many of the time and seasonally variant error components inherent in the Loran solution can be largely mitigated by hosting the two in a combined receiver system. In doing so, mathematical algorithms can be designed to allow for the learning of Loran error contributors during GPS coverage periods which can then, in turn, be applied in a compensation arrangement, resulting in a highly jam-resistant, drop-out resistant, robust integrated PNT solution, essentially superior to either individual resource!

The combined eLoran/GPS solution would be the ultimate PNT resource for countless applications, including those associated with unmanned ground, air and marine systems. This integrated system would eventually become the standard for PNT solutions of all kinds. Without proceeding with the proposal to complete the enhancement of Loran, this critical advancement for the future of the nations defense and communications infrastructure will not be possible.

I have been an active eLoran advocate for several decades. As an MIT Aerospace engineer, AF Space pioneer and iotron (DigiPLOT) founder. I have become passionate in this critical and worthy cause to resurrect eLoran.
 
Advocating eLoran is based on my 30 years experience at MITRE in NAVWAR and GPS, and was the only eLoran advocate for military missions improvement with prior actual experience that identified some of the many beneficial ways of complimenting GPS with eLoran.  The goal was to recover GPS former strategic advantage from its current civil and military status, particularly its recently identified/acknowledged GPS no detect spoofing vulnerability.
 
 International development of eLoran continues in response to initiatives such as eNavigation

  Critical Infrastructure that rely on GPS for precise time includes power grids, financial, and telecoms and all air and maritime transportation ocean and inland water, as the basis of most worldwide commerce

  Interference, jamming, and spoofing are all real and potential threats are all mitigated by eLoran
 
This response includes civilian and military eLoran applications for:
   -Ship collision/allision avoidance as well as navigational caused groundings to prevent oil spills

   -Ship navigation SEEMP steering fuel savings for greenhouse gas reduction, lessening climate change
 
   -Underground communication, positioning, navigation and mapping in caves, tunnels and mine shaft disasters for   emergency lifesaving and military use in mountainous areas

Greetings,
I am a serving master mariner for the international US maritime transportation system. I support Redundant Navigation Systems and I support the international effort to require that redundant and independent electronic navigation system(s) (such as e-Loran) be established to back up Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology.


This is important both for navigational assurance, environmental protection and national security.

Commenter:  CAPT David B. Moskoff

Thank you for this opportunity to comment.  I am speaking for myself and not for any government entity.

(a) A brief description of your application(s) of positioning, navigation, and timing services;
Having served earlier in my career as a ship's officer, primarily aboard U.S. coast-wise tankers, I came to quickly appreciate the critical necessity for navigation positioning and the benefits of electronic satellite and loran systems.  I have learned first-hand how important it is to know your ship's exact location, especially in shallow areas where a high speed vessel proceeding in excess of 20 knots can run into difficulty in a mere matter of minutes.  As a Master aboard these tankers, my appreciation for accurate electronic positioning understandably became more acute.  

As a private pilot with FAA single engine high horsepower rating as well as an avid small boat owner, I know that electronic positioning is not just a concern for large tankers just off the rocky shores of the U.S. coastline.  Large ships that go aground on our shores can inflict severe consequences in magnitudes almost beyond comprehension.  The oil spill this past week off Santa Barbara is yet another grim reminder of the extreme and long-lasting damaging effects of oil to the marine environment.  The 2010 BP blowout of the DEEPWATER HORIZON in the Gulf of Mexico reached a cost to BP in excess of 42 billion US dollars by 2013.  A VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier) also can spill significant amounts of oil.  These vessels come to our shores every day.  Vessels deliver dangerous cargoes besides oil daily via our environment.

We are aware this wayward oil does not have to be the ship's cargo to cause serious harm since the engine fuel (bunkers) alone is carried in such large quantities that damage to a single bunker tank can have significant impacts as we have seen on numerous occasions off our shores and others.   If a CONUS eLoran system were implemented only to serve the marine transportation sector, it would be a very wise investment for this use solely.  The known cost of a single medium size oil spill from vessel grounding may very well run into the same hundreds of millions of dollars that it is anticipated to cost to implement and run CONUS eLoran for 20 years.  Preventing one oil spill could pay for the system for 20+ years!  For comparison, a single GPS satellite costs this type of money by the time it is designed, bid, built and launched.  As a complementary navigation positioning source, eLoran would be a very worthwhile investment.  As many know, the PNT acronym's most important letter has morphed from its early days assisting with positioning and timing, to become the super-critical (T)imekeeper of the world.

As a professor at a maritime academy, I have a enhanced appreciation for PNT systems and particularly GPS due to the timekeeping aspects.  Since I use many parts of the U.S. critical infrastructure daily, it seems fair to say that outlining ""A brief description of your application(s) of positioning, navigation, and timing services"" for me would not be unlike most other U.S. citizens who use electricity, telecommunications and banking, etc. every day.  This would be especially critical if ""(b) the positioning, navigation, and/or timing performance required for a complementary PNT capability to support operations during a disruption of GPS that could last for longer than a day"".

Since the timing aspect of PNT has largely become more important than the positioning aspect and so inherently crucial to everything we do, how could we not immediately implement a second system for timing in the form of eLoran? 

(c) availability and coverage area required for a complementary PNT capability;
Coverage needs to be similar to GPS so the two systems can be universally and uniformly relied upon to support the same system and user demands at similar tolerances. Since GPS (and all GNSS including GLONASS, Galileo, etc.) are satellite based and eLoran is terrestrially based, this would be the very best of partnerships.  The two systems, GPS and eLoran, are so very different in transmission frequencies, signal power, vulnerabilities, etc. that they have quite different failure modes - what impacts one will probably not impact the other.  Please see the attachment describing the units used in the English Channel for years now that automatically switch from one system to the other during failures. 

To accomplish this uniformity between systems for both timing and positioning (about 8-10 meters?), coverage would need to extend throughout the Alaska/CONUS coastlines and include those ""fringe"" areas where present geometry of eLoran stations requires stations in Canada and Mexico, some new. These areas, like the Florida Keys, Gulf of Mexico and southern California areas would seem to require two new stations in northern Mexico perhaps totaling 35-45 stations.

I write to support continued funding of this system. I am a vessel captain (fourth issuance of license), maritime lawyer, former instructor of nautical science, including celestial, radar, and coastal piloting, and former magazine editor of the magazines Ocean Navigator and Professional Mariner. The reason I support a continuation of Loran is that the system is so different from the ubiquitous GPS. Unlike GPS, Loran is land-based and requires no satellite support. Loran is a basic system that is easy to use. It's unique and valuable in determining our position near shore. It is inexpensive to use. One of the most basic tenets of nautical science and, indeed, maritime law in the rules of the road, is that one never relies wholly on one navigational system or one navigational aid. I remember when Omega disappeared; I remember when SatNav disappeared. Now, we're faced with the possibility of having a single, albeit exceedingly accurate and brilliant, system of GPS that is wholly satellite based. Loran is a perfect complement to that system. Like many mariners I value my ability to navigate by celestial, by radar, by Loran, by GPS, by dead reckoning, and by coastal chart plotting. Each of these systems is important. But, together, they make up the panoply of the available resources I and others use to make navigational decisions in the challenging marine environment. One never knows which system might not be working on any particular day and any particular voyage. In times of lean budgets it's tempting to say, ""We don't need this old system because we have this great new one that does it all!"" But this is contrary to maritime tradition where the use of a diverse set of resources is considered fundamental practice as to be common sense. Please do not phase out Loran. It's an important, useful system that is worth maintaining. -- Twain Braden, Esq., Portland, Maine",,,,,,,

Enhanced LORAN would be a welcome safety net for the fishing industry.  It is my assumption that the field accuracy of eLORAN would fall somewhere between LORANc and the current GPS.  With this level of repeatable accuracy, I think you would find buy in from the industry.  I cannot speak to the needs of other fishing operators in the South Atlantic or other SE areas; however, coverages that are complimentary to LORANc would be satisfactory.  Fishermen are an interesting group, although we use LAT/LONG GPS receivers, many still convert to phantom LORAN and prefer to talk in LORAN TD language.  Old habits are hard to break!

Making a determination of how many operators would install eLORAN receivers is likely a supplier question.  The fishing industry would probably embrace this if units were user friendly, priced right and available.  

If my memory is correct I recall that when we produced LORANa, not long after OMEGA navigation was retired.  When LORANc was introduced, LORANa was phased out.  When GPS was introduced, LORANc was phased out.  I have never felt comfortable with maritime and/or aviation interests having only one navigation platform.  It is probably time for eLORAN.

One of our major client groups are dynamic positioned vessels such as drill ships which rely on GPS and other GNSS signals for safe operation and environmental protection. In an attempt to insulate these vessels from the threat of loss of GPS we have introduced systems using INS to give a short breathing space in the event of total loss of GPS. These systems are effective for a few minutes, not for a prolonged period.
eLoran can be use as an aiding source to the INS to enable safe station keeping for hours following complete GNSS shutdown, this would give ample time for the safe termination of drilling operations.
eLoran is also useful when partial GPS outages occur as good GPS can do a running calibration of the eLoran data further improving accuracy, to the point where it can 'fill in' such outages.
eLoran has another advantage for mariners in that it can also calculate true heading with certain antenna configurations. This again backs up users who use GPS derived compasses.

The City of Glendale, which operates both fixed route and paratransit services, wholeheartedly thanks DOT for consideration of a coordinated fare for the County of Los Angeles ADA complimentary service.  With 88 cities in one of the largest and most complex counties in the U.S., persons with disabilities are relying on a paratransit service that provides a straight forward and easily understood fare payment system.  With the two tiered fare system that has been in place for 20 years, an overwhelming majority of Access services patrons have paid the standard fare of $2.75 regardless of trip destination, numerous jurisdictions traveled through, or which of the multiple fixed route service providers served any comparable part of a desired trip.  

The current process is simple and effective for a very diverse population with a wide range of disabilities to navigate.  Glendale has over 5,000 Access users in our jurisdiction who have been very well served by the current coordinated fare structure and access to countywide destinations.  We have a very large community of persons with cognitive disabilities that are able to travel independently in part because of the simple fare structure.  

As the daughter of a person with cognitive disabilities, the potential for an alternative, possibly dynamic fare system, would severely complicate my mother's ability to understand and respond to the fare fluctuations without becoming frustrated, confused or needing additional outside assistance to be able to continue to use Access service.   The goal should be to keep persons with disabilities as independent and mobile as possible and not burden them with additional complications.

My name is Kathleen Barajas, and am a customer of Access Services. I am writing you regarding the proposed fare structure change which the Department of Transportation is imposing on Access.
Although the disability community is totally in favor of not being overcharged for their transportation, there are many other issues in doubling the fixed route fare in L.A. Countys complex system that have not been considered and would be detrimental to Access riders. 
The fare structure being proposed by Access Services would prove to be too difficult for its riders, but especially for those with cognitive/intellectual disabilities. To illustrate the point, here is how the new fare will be calculated. When a rider calls to schedule a ride, there will be a computer program that will look the requested trip on Metros Trip Planner website. Already this is an issue as there will be no human eyes here, such as determining which of several routes make the most sense. The reservationist would then use the cost of, I believe, a trip with the lowest fare as a base. The base would then be doubled, then rounded down to the nearest dollar, or to 50 cents if less than a dollar. Possible fares would be no charge, $.50, $1.00, $2.00, $3.00, or $4.00. Currently, Access fare structure is $2.75 for trips up to 20 miles, $3.50 for trips over 20 miles.
It is my understanding that Access developed this proposed structure of six (6) fares based on the vast array of comparable fares of Los Angeles Countys Transit System. Because Los Angeles County is comprised of many, many cities, there is an equal number of varied fares, ranging from free to $5 or more. Although it is unfair for Access riders to be charged more than double for some of their rides, compared to the same fixed-route trip, I can ensure you that these riders would prefer to continue to be overcharged as opposed to having to deal with a complex structure of six different fares which would cause the following issues.
The first issue is about the use of Metros Trip Planner. This website tool proves to be difficult to use, and I have heard of many non-disabled individuals who cannot figure out how to use the site. If these individuals cannot use this online tool, how can someone with a cognitive disability be expected to navigate such? It can be argued that Access riders are not required to be able to use this website, however, the ability to do so will help riders estimate the fare of the rides they will book.
The concept of a fare structure that will be comprised of six possible fares will prove to be a nightmare for many Access riders. As mentioned above, individuals with cognitive disabilities will find it impossible to remember what the fare is for each trip. It is likely that even the current structure of two fares is challenging enough for these riders, however basing the fare on the distance of the trip is the way that the current fare can be thought of.
This new fare structure will make it very difficult, if not impossible, for riders to estimate their monthly transportation costs. Most of Access riders have Social Security as their only source of income, and are forced to allocate a fixed amount per month for Access rides. Having an array of six possible fare amounts, as opposed to only two, will make it impossible for these individuals to figure out how much to budget each month for transportation. This is serious, because should the individual run out of money before the month is over and find themselves needing to go see a doctor, they might have to forego receiving crucial medical attention. 
Finally, Access riders have been forced to deal with fare increases in the last few years, and cannot afford to have still another fare increase. Should a maximum of $4.00 be implemented, riders could experience an increase of $1.25 on rides which they are currently paying $2.75 for. Riders who live in group homes or other facilities are left with a budget of $35-$50 per month for extracurricular expenses, including transportation. How are these individuals expected to afford still another fare increase? Many of these riders are severely disabled, and not able to freely get out in the community. Raising the fare once again will deprive these individuals of the little enjoyment that they get when they are able to go on outings and such.
As a Disability Rights Advocate, on behalf of the disability community of Los Angeles County, I am pleading with the FTA to allow Access Services to continue using their current fare structure. Exceptions sometimes need to be made to accommodate the needs of the public, this is certainly a perfect example. The disability community already has other obstacles against us; we should not have to struggle with our transportation needs as well.
Thank you in advance for your time and support in this matter.",,,,,,,

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important issue.  I am a regular user of OCTA ACCESS in neighboring Orange County.  OCTA charges more for ACCESS service at $3.75 a trip.  As nearly everyone who uses paratransit services is on a fixed income and as SSDI monthly payments to benificiaries are due to be cut 20% across the board next year, I do believe strongly that there should be a cap placed on paratransit fares per boarding where they would not go higher than 30% of the cost per boarding on a fixed route bus line.  I also would support creating a system where fares for persons who receive MediCaid, MediCare, or Department of Veterans Affairs help be provided with reduced fare programs for paratransit services that would reduce the per boarding fare by up to 25%.  This should be allowed for transit systems like OCTA and LAMetro where reduced fare programs are already in effect on the fixed route bus system specifically for those passengers who receive MediCaid services.  
The issue of how many tiers or zones should there be in any county, city, or regional transit system before they become unmanageable for persons with disabilities is also a critical factor.  For persons who have developmental disabilities (ID/DD), the fewer zones to worry about the better and the fewer problems for all concerned.  Here in Orange County, it is easy because there are no fare zones intra-county.  In Los Angeles County, the different fixed route bus systems need to do a better job of coordinating their fare structures so you would have a countywide level fare.  Or, there would be only one fare zone that would be a fare for the metropolitan City of Los Angeles and a single level fare for the rest of Los Angeles County.  Either way would make things easier for disabled passengers to figure what they need for round trip bus fare and make it easier for paratransit riders paying their fares.  The per boarding cost of paratransit fares is the critical factor since most clients are on fixed incomes.  For everyone who uses paratransit, it is the glue that allows us to live as independently in the community as possible by connecting us to housing, medical access, supported employment jobs, and various community services.  Thank you.",,,,,,,

OCTA is doing a fare study now which will probably mean fare increases proposal sometime next year.  I did want to add some additional thoughts to my comments of last night--8/21/2015.
Some transit systems in California have on-demand call-in service in some areas they serve instead of regular fixed route service and other systems operate flex-route bus lines that can deviate off the regular fixed route.  OCTA is looking at possibly doing both types here in Orange County.  In the case of the on-demand call-in service, everyone who needs transportation in the on-demand service area calls in for service and usually the smaller ACCESS size minibuses are used to pick up everyone and provide a curb to curb type service.  In cases where the bus system uses on-demand call-in service in a given service area and does not provide any specially set aside paratransit service, the fare paid should be the same for all passengers--not more than 10% of the fixed route bus system fare should be the cap.  This would mean that persons who get ACCESS service now would see their fare come down some and people who use fixed route bus system but they live in an on-demand service area with no fixed route bus line would see their fare for on-demand service increase some from the regular fixed route fare.  The same should apply on bus lines that use flex-route service if there is no paratransit option for disabled passengers.  I think a 10% cap in areas where everyone must use the same on-demand call-in service; or use the same flex-line service; and there is no special paratransit service for these areas this is a good compromise.   It would be fair for non-disabled passengers living in the on-demand area to pay a little more for their on-demand connection to the fixed-route bus system; and since more people would be using the minibuses in the on-demand area, it would be fair for passengers who would otherwise be using the paratransit system, to see their fare come down some.
Since on-demand call-in service and flex-route service would link to the regular fixed route bus system, there would be two fare zones.  One fare zone would be for people who live in an on-demand area or flex-route area.  The other would be for paratransit in the fixed-route bus system but the fare for paratransit in the fixed-route system operating area would be no more than 20%-25% of the regular fixed route bus fare and be capped at that point.  While certain parts of a transit system's territory may be on-demand and/or flex-route service for everyone and other parts be regular fixed-route service with corresponding paratransit service' the on-demand and flex-route fare would be level across the operating territory of the transit system and the regular fixed-route and ACCESS fare would be level throughout the agency's operating territory.  The fare zone would be based on type of service, not miles of distance to travel.  One zone for on-demand call-in service/flex-route service; one zone for regular fixed route service that has corresponding ACCESS service.  Thank you.",,,,,,,

My years of experience give me the basis on which to make the following comment.

People with disabilities are often on a limited income, and they have very few options when it comes to transportation.  Therefore, I support maintaing the current FTA regulation which limits the charge for complementary paratransti to twice the fixed route rate.  Even this amount is often more than many people can pay, and so they are not able to participate in a lifestyle which most of us take for granted - social events, faith based activities, entertainment, etc.

Currently WMATA serves 3 major jurisdictions (Md, Va and the District of Columbia and smaller areas within, such as Montgomery County and prince George County). Their current calculation of fare per trip is based upon the ""fastest trip"" and varies between bus and rail fares at various times of the day and week between nthe same 2 points. The calculation is done by computer using a complex alagorithm which can be quite opaque and confusing to customers.

I also know other consumers with disabilities would find this new payment structure difficult to deal with and would be unable to use paratransit because it would be unaffordable. Any fare structure that charges more than twice than the fixed rate is not permissable under the ADA.

By regulations stipulated within the guidelines of the fare shall be being ""no more than twice the regional average fixed-route 
fare"", this regulation should be adhered to unless the regulation policy changes.  That being said, being familiar with bus 
systems and ADA paratransit services, for such a route as in the Los Angeles area where the issue stemmed from 
raising the paratransit fare because the paratransit trip was 20 miles or more from the central bus route location.
Because of this, the fare seemingly was greater than twice the regular bus fare.  Express buses (buses that travel
 outside the normal bus route/city system) usually have zoned areas which charge more to go to those zoned areas, being
more expensive the farther from the central point the express bus travels.  So, that being said, is there an express bus
which has such a zoned fare schedule for the Los Angeles area in question, and, if so, would the paratransit fare charged
be within the parameters of the set fee schedule of not being more than twice the regular fare.  If this is indeed the case,
then the fare charged for paratransit would be within the guidelines of the regulation already put into place.  Currently in the
state of Connecticut, paratransit services do not travel express zoned bus routes.  Doing so would greatly increase the
availability of transportation services needed by many individuals with disabilities.  So, if what was just stated could be
put into place within new regulation guidelines, ADA compliance would be much better served.  The current public 
transportation system is very limited to those in rural areas and with a beginning step to change a federal regulation to 
assist in implementing such a small change would greatly increase economic viability for those with disabilities so they
would be able to get to and from a job.

My name is Ms. Deborah Miles, and I use Access Services Paratransit in order to maintain my independence with regard to transportation.
As you may be aware, Access Services is proposing a new fare structure.  Instead of the current 2-tier rate system, they are 
proposing a system in which the cost of each ride would be calculated individually. 
The proposed fare structure would calculate each trip fare by comparing the cost of the same fixed route trip and would double 
and round down to the nearest proposed fare.  The proposed fare levels are $0, $.50, $1, $2, $3, $4.  
Most trips would then be in the $3-$4 range.

At local community meetings sponsored by Access Services Inc., passengers have objected unanimously to this 
new proposed fare structure for the following reasons:

1)This new fare structure would mean a fare increase for many trips;

2)The new fare structure is confusing for most people using Paratransit especially those with cognitive, 
     intellectual, memory, and some physical and sensory disabilities;

3) Many Paratransit riders qualify for the service due to their inability to navigate a complex fixed route system,
    which is exactly what the new are structure is proposing;

4) Each trip does not have a consistent fare and thus it will be impossible to budget for transportation;

5) The new fare system may result in further isolation for people with disabilities who rely on Access 
     in order to maintain their independence.
 
In order to maintain the CURRENT fare structure, Access Services needs a Rule Change to apply to our county {Los Angeles County} 
which is a coordinated system of many transit providers.  If this new proposed fare structure becomes a reality this will be devastating 
for many Access Services Passengers! Please remember that it's the passengers who keep this Paratransit Provider employed. 
If we can no longer afford to utilize this service, what good is it to us or it's employees? 
Thank you for your time and consideration regarding this important matter.

Sincerely,
Ms. Deborah Miles, BA
Access Services Inc. Paratransit Passenger

Viewed singly, each proposed increase appears small, but viewed monthly, or per patient, whose income is most often limited to a flat grant, the Share Of Cost and Food budgeting by that individual would be adversely affected.
You have to look at the whole monthly budget, and see the Big Picture.
Many families work day-time jobs and keep their disabled relative at home, which saves the State money (lower outflows for SNF and/or ALF Waiver care costs).
So based on what I am often asked, I foresee such ""nickel and diming"" as creating incentives for placement, which will result in increased cost to the state, diminished family relationships for the patient, less independence for the patient, and greater divisions in society.

I am one of two elderlaw Attorneys in LA County with prior employment experience at DPSS, administering public benefits.  
As a result, I am often asked questions about how public benefits work.
My comment above is the result of reflection about the questions I am asked by many various families.

Subject: Support for Access Services' Petition for Rulemaking

Dear Secretary Foxx:

As both a social worker who works with people with disabilities and Access Services rider for nearly 20 years I am writing in support of Access Services' Petition for Rulemaking that asks for an amendment to the Department of Transportation's regulations concerning the calculation of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit fares.  I work at OPICA Adult daycare and United Cerebral Palsy in Los Angeles. The majority of clients at both these agencies use Access Services as their primary means of transportation. 

Access uses a simple, two-tier coordinated fare that has been in existence for nearly twenty years.   It was implemented after consultation with the disability community and a number of advocacy groups because it is fair and easy for our customers to understand.   We are very concerned that any new fare system will be significantly more complex and lead to confusion amongst our clients.  We are also concerned that a new fare system could lead to higher fares for certain clients, many of whom live on fixed-incomes. 

Any changes to the fare structure may prevent people from being able to get to and from doctor appointments and or other daily programs due to prohibitive costs. Therefore, Access riders may be forced to choose between essential activities and their health and safety could be at risk. In addition many Access riders have difficulty handling money and without a fixed fare system they will not be able to use the coupons that are their only means to pay their fares independently.

The Americans with Disabilities Act has been a blessing for people with disabilities in America and the Department and the Federal Transit Administration deserve a lot of credit for ensuring that transit agencies comply with the regulations.   However, in this instance, we would urge the Department to amend the regulations to allow Access' coordinated fare to continue as it has for the last two decades.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.   If you have any questions, I can be reached at 310-473-6924 or by email at crismir6@yahoo.com.

Sincerely,

Kimberly S. Hudson MSW

I have access services since 1994.  I am very happy for the service.  I would like for non changes because it affects people with disabilities especially wheelchair users.  We need the same service and routine to keep our doctor appointments and social appointments with independent living centers.  With the financial situation at home this change will affect us because we live on a fixed income.  

I feel very happy because of Access Services.  It has given me independence and it's a gift from God.  Great personnel and drivers.   I am more happy now as a Access user than when I was able to drive.  

Please make no changes to the fares.

Thank You",,,,,,,

This change is against my disabilities rights and will force me to stay at home couldn't go some of my doctor's appointments, also, couldn't enjoy my life because I can not afford to leave my home.

I don't want to turn into a vegetable by remaining at home and not doing anything, isn't enough what I am going with many disabilities and pain through my life.

I understand that this is a business but we have to take better account of whom and what we are dealing with to make the system better and flawless.  You have some riders that are in wheelchairs and those who walk with walkers and your drivers should be allowed more time to travel with them.  The reality is that it takes more than 15 minutes to go from one side of town to the other, as well as time to walk those who walk slowly and for those who are in wheelchairs. Since there are additional things that must be done to get them up the lift, seated and belted in.  Most importantly our time schedule should be what matters the most, getting the riders where they need to be on time.  They have recently changed the way they do things and I don't agree with picking up your rider and making them ride to another pick-up and the rider has to wait 15 - 20 minutes so that the other rider can be picked up on time which causes the first rider to be late to their appointment.  That rule just doesn't make sense.  As far as the fare, I feel that it is great and reasonable but we all should pay the same.  As for those people who are using para transit it shouldn't matter about the bus routes being a key factor in whether we should be charged more based upon the buses.  The question is why are we punished or penalized for our disabilities?  All we are trying to do is live life to the fullest with the deck of cards we have been dealt.",,,,,,,

I may not have the money to cover the fare. I am on a fixed income. The price could change in the morning and it could be different in the afternoon or evening. This is very disconcerting to me. I use coupons for my payment. Under this proposed system we may have to use multiple coupons for a one way trip. I cannot handle multiple coupons because I am afraid I will drop them. The cost of the ride can be various prices, from 50 cents up to $4. This is also very confusing and cost ineffective for fixed income recipient. I can not ride on a bus route. My main way of transit is Access Services. If these prices go up, I will not be able to make some choices of where I travel. I would prefer that you keep the present fare system. Can you allow a tiered system based on mileage because that is the impression I have? I need clarification about price range. How much will the book of tickets cost? 

I live independently in the community in my own apartment and live on SSI and SSA. I must budget all my expenses for the month so that all my expenses are covered. 

Thank you for letting us communicate our concern with you. I am a registered voter. I support Access' petition and wish the current fare system stay the same because it is much easier to understand.

Please notify me about your decision and what type of fare will be implemented and start date. Thank you very much.

Dynamic Fare is too confusing!

I won't know how much the fare will be until I make my ride. I don't have a computer at home. I'm not able to see the difference in paper bills on the spot. I go through several cities to get to my program, very complicated. Some routes may be changed depending on time of day--- I won't be able to know my budget ahead of time.

This dynamic fare will make using Access more difficult and LESS USABLE for me.

I am on a fixed income and the fare could go from the current $2.75 per ride to $4.00 per ride. I won't be able to afford $8.00 a day for all my rides to my program. I will have to pick which rides to take. I will need more assistance, I won't be as independent.

Sincerely,
An Access Rider",,,,,,,

I writing in regard to the proposed dynamic fare system. I am urging you to allow Access Services to keep its current fare structure and NOT make this change. Under the current two-tiered system (which has been in place for more than 20 years) I can make my own reservations  over the telephone and write down the times and confirmation times by myself.  One of the big reasons I can make the reservation myself. If it changes, it would cause confusion and undue stress. I have been an Access rider sine it started. I have experienced physical and cognitive changes during this time and the changes would cause undue stress, not to mention the training of all the reservations. Getting ready for my trips or planning ahead is simple right now. I appreciate the system, unless I go with my care givers, I cannot ride the bus easily. I signed up for Access about 20 years ago and now they have more demand that they manage easily.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

SOMETIMES I TAKE CITYRIDE TO PLACES SOMETIMES CITYRIDE CHARGES MORE THAN TWICE THE FARE IF I 

TOOK THE BUS!


WHEN I TOOK ACCESS SERVICE TO CBS STUDIOS IN THE PAST THE COMPUTER CALCULATED DIFFERENT 

MILEAGES EACH TIME; THIS WAS VERY CONFUSING. 


I'M LOW INCOME ACCESS SERVICE PASSENGER AND LEGALLY BLIND.

I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THIS RATE HIKE AT ALL!   AT WORK I ONLY GET PAID LESS THAN MINIUM RAGE.

I FEEL YOU SHOULD NOT CHANGE FARES AT ALL.  WHEN METRO DECIDES TO INCREASE FARES ON THE BUS 

SO THEY CAN KEEP ALL THE BUS LINES, EVERY TIME FARES GOES UP ON METRO THEN
 
THEY CANCELED  A FEW BUS LINES WHICH THEY SAID IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN.   PLEASE DON'T CHANGE THE 

FARE HIKE WITH ACCESS SERVICE PARATRANSIT SO IT WONT BE SO CONFUSING ABOUT THE FARE.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION AND UNDERSTANDING.

The Access Services proposes the following addition to 49 CFR 37.131(c) on service criteria for complementary paratransit:
Alternatively, the maximum fare that may be charged by an entity which administers a coordinated paratransit plan for 20 or more fixed route members pursuant to 49 CFR 37.141 and approved pursuant to 49 CFR 37.147 shall be no more than twice the regional average fixed-route fare determined as follows:

 The entity may calculate a regional average fixed-route fare by obtaining a statistically-valid, random sample of its recent paratransit trips, calculating the applicable fixed-route fare for those trips and averaging the results. The sample may be subdivided by distance to determine the regional average fixed-route fares for trips of a certain mileage.

I have pasted the amendment to the current rule on paratransit fares in this document because, upon reading it several times I think that this rule may allow paratransit providers to exploit persons with disabilities who use paratransit services. Please consider these two points.

1. The proposed amendment appears to rely heavily on statistical analysis and averages. Right now, it is easy for the vast majority of people to determine what double a fare might be. For example, as a Paratransit rider here in Connecticut, I know that a regular fixed route ride within the Greater Hartford area cost $1.50 any paratransit then a Paratransit rider knows that his or her fare is going to be $3. From an enforcement perspective, it is much easier for people to catch transportation providers when the math is easy, rather than when an average is used. For example, a paratransit rider may have to utilize a FOIA request in order to find out how the average was arrived at, how the sample was done etc. All of this would have to be done before filing a complaint.

2. The US DOT should also consider that entities that provide services to individuals with disabilities try to find ways to interpret regulations so that regulations work most favorably for the entity providing services. For example, who is going to be doing the statistical sampling and computing the average fare for a particular trip? Will the average truly reflect the full data set for a trip, or will the transportation provider be able to pick the highest number of the data set?

There is no question that paratransit services cost more than fixed route services. In Connecticut, the average paratransit trip costs $55 of which only is provided by the consumer. Revenue is an issue for providers of paratransit services, however I think there are alternatives to generate new revenue that have not been considered. For example, paratransit providers can provide extended services outside the typical fixed route operation. Perhaps fares for these rides could be capped at the same level as taxi fares, thereby generating more revenue for the provider. In addition providing extended services outside of the fixed route operation would allow consumers more flexibility in getting more they need to go.

I would also like to propose that the comment period for this document be extended, as I believe independent living centers across the country would be very interested in this petition. At a minimum, I believe that the Department should make a reasonable effort to mail information regarding this docket to agencies that serve people with disabilities, such as independent living centers.I know that if this petition is granted, paratransit providers will jump at it as a reason to raise fares. Before that happens, all efforts should be made to make sure that this petition is considered deliberately. I also think that if the US DOT made a reasonable effort to reach out to agencies that serve persons with disabilities this petition will be, not by far more than 91 individuals (At the time of this writing, and including my comments.)

I thank you for your consideration,

Andrew Bate

Urging denial of the petition to allow coordinated fares for ADA Paratransit.

Simplicity is the persistent theme of the comments offered in support of this petition. However, there is no impediment in the existing rules to a paratransit provider implementing a coordinated tiered system, as long as they take the simple precaution of ensuring that the rates they choose are no more than twice as high as the full fare for the lowest cost fixed route trip in each tier. All of the clarity and predictability of a coordinated tiered system are readily available to any paratransit provider willing to operate within that simple restriction. So, the only real change that granting this petition will allow will be the elimination of the existing cost cap on paratransit fares, and along with it the elimination of any linkage between the cost of a trip by fixed route and the same trip by paratransit. That linkage between the cost of the same trip by fixed route and paratransit is an expression of the single most fundamental principle of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The purpose of the Act is to prohibit discrimination based on disability. The parallel paratransit requirement is a recognition that fixed route design an operation denies some individuals an equal transportation opportunity, and that paratransit is necessary to restore that equal opportunity. Allowing a paratransit provider to charge a person with a disability twice what a person without a disability to be charged to obtain an equal transportation opportunity, already strains that principle substantially. Allowing the fares to go even higher than that, and eliminating the link between the cost of trip by fixed route and the same trip by paratransit would violate the principle on which that linkage was based. 

Several of the commenters supporting the petition correctly point out that pratransit fares are already are a substantial burden and barrier for substantial numbers of people with disabilities (While also expressing the misguided opinion that maintaining the status quo cap on fares would somehow cause fare increases.) Eliminating the existing limit on those fares would place mobility with their communities outside of the reach of many.

The petitioner has several options for easy solutions, allowing it to comply with the spirit and letter of the law, with little impact on its operations, or bottom line. Instead, it has asked the Department to clear the way for substantial and burdensome increases in the fares for many paratransit trips, and to do so through a rule change that would violate the purpose of the law the rule is meant to enact.

Subject: Support for Access Services' Petition for Rulemaking
Docket No. DOT-OST-2015-0075

To whom it may concern:
On behalf of Communities Actively Living & Free (CALIF), we are writing in support of Access Services' Petition for Rulemaking that asks for an amendment to the Department of Transportation's regulations concerning the calculation of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit fares.  CALIF serves people with disabilities in 50 zip codes of Central Los Angeles, and all its diverse communities of minority races, ethnicities and other population categories.

Access uses a simple, two-tier coordinated fare that has been in existence for nearly twenty years.   It was implemented after consultation with the disability community and a number of advocacy groups because it is fair and easy for our customers to understand.   We are very concerned that any new fare system will be significantly more complex and lead to confusion amongst our clients.  We are also concerned that a new fare system could lead to higher fares for certain clients, many of whom live on fixed-incomes.

The Americans with Disabilities Act has been a blessing for people with disabilities in America and the Department and the Federal Transit Administration deserve a lot of credit for ensuring that transit agencies comply with the regulations.   However, in this instance, we would urge the Department to amend the regulations to allow Access' coordinated fare to continue as it has for the last two decades.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.   If you have any questions, I can be reached at (213) 627-0477 or via e-mail at Lnavarro@calif-ilc.org.

I will give my input on how I do my transpiration hoping it can somehow help you. First of all I don't do any wheel chairs or anything with a lift.  We dont have the capacity to deal with wheelchairs/lifts because we use volunteers with their own private vehicles.  My drivers not only volunteer their vehicles, but also their time.  They go house to house or to a facility, and take clients to doctors or grocery stores etc. The price of a 1-way trip is $3.50 to the customer (roundtrip: $7.00). I try and line my clients up with a volunteer that lives in their vicinity hoping to keep the price down.  Volunteer drivers receive a stipend of 40 cents a mile to help them cover their costs.  Depending on how far a customer needs to go, the price the customer pays does not cover the actual cost of the service.  My program is affiliated with a regional senior center (Siouxland Center for Active Generations) that has to absorb the shortfalls.  More federal support for transportation would be very helpful.

I am writing to voice my concerns as a passenger regarding the proposed changes to the fare structure of Los Angeles Access Paratransit.  No matter what the fare structure that is ultimately decided upon, more attention should be given to the negative impact to riders who are much more likely to be unable to be paid in a fulltime job than their able-bodied counterparts.

First and foremost, the flier we received last month on this subject was misleading; it said that we were to be charged twice as much for paratransit as we would be charged for a comparable trip on the bus; So, all blind passengers should be free and all disabled should pay no more than $1.50; any user of Medicare or MediCal should pay only 70 cents per trip during certain times of the day.  That has never been the case; it is always based on the ""normal"" bus riders fare.  This is true for a group of people least likely to be fully-employed or of even a middle-class income!  It has placed an undue burden on us for the service!

And what exactly is a comparable trip?  InLos Angeles, especially, there are so many options!  While the train may be the fastest, many bus riders may choose the bus because it drops them nearer their favorite shopping area or closer to home.  Some may choose to walk further and get a direct ride to where they're going instead of many transfers.  Which route will the computer trip planner randomly pick and therefore how many buses will be calculated?  In response to my query about this, they said the fastest route would be chosen first and then the cheapest from that list.  But, in reality, if a paratransit trip were to take the same amount of time as a slower alternative, shouldn't be pay less, or have the initial option of doing so?  It's a crap shoot!  The whole law needs to be revised!

Furthermore, the law's allowance to charge based on twice the bus fare for regular bus riders is patently unfair.  It is not even based off of disabled discounts on the bus for the same riders.  It does not take into consideration a passenger's income or the ability for a rider of paratransit to pay for the ride; so, even if the disabled person's insurance plan allows at least trips to the doctor to be free, one of the portions of the population least likely to be able to afford the service must depend on it for everything from groceries to school to volunteer positions; perhaps, financial aid could be required to reduce the pain in the pocketbook and to make this a little more equitable.  

In addition, paratransit riders do not have the options that many smart able-bodied bus riders have to save money; we cannot get passes of any duration; if we were able to access these passes, (charged double the disabled rate for the same passes) that would help a lot.  That would also make it not as important to figure out the cost of different routes involved in each reservation.  We already use the Tap card system; so, why couldn't that be incorporated in that or even by using a state-issued ID and the numbers and picture to go withit?

If you do decide to keep the original fare structure for the present, it still needs to be overhauled big time.  The inclusion of financial aid based on income and need, as mentioned earlier, might benefit both paratransit and bus riders alike.  The addition of extra tiers of distance and payment might also move the company closer to compliance.  So, instead of only two tiers, (with such a huge difference between them) could become four or more--starting at one or two dollars. 

Also, the whole notion of twice the fare definitely has to be revised to include pass options, disabled fares, and financial need.

Thank you for your time and consideration.  Have a truly fantastic day.

Warmly,


Catherine Fischbach

I am a person who has a disability and a fulltime wheelchair user and have used paratransit on many occasions and have also served as the assistant general manager for system-wide accessibility at the MBTA. Access Services proposes that the current DOT rules be changed to allow paratransit providers to calculate the costs for a fare based on a two-tier fare structure versus the current DOT requirement. The logic proposed by Access Services is that paratransit users will benefit from a fare system that is easier to understand. The reason Access Services has proposed a rule change on the fare structure is based on the findings that Access Services received on a DOT/FTA triennial review. The DOT/FTA triennial review found that Access Services was using a two tier fare structure that increased the costs for paratransit riders, a cost that was above the maximum allowable given the current DOT rules. Access Services answer to the DOT/FTA triennial findings was to propose their fare structure, a two tier fare structure, as an easier to understand system. Access Services makes the claim that people with disabilities would find an easier to understand fare structure more important than maintaining the current less expensive paratransit fare. A higher cost trip is still a higher cost to the user.  Higher costs for paratransit trips for any reason will only force some to decide not to make a trip due to the higher costs which is exactly what I believe the proposed two tier fare structure will do.  How can this be a positive change for people with disabilities who use paratransit systems? Paratransit systems were created because fixed route systems were not accessible. Today many fixed route systems still have significant ADA deficiencies that make their systems less than 100% accessible or compliant.  Lack of an accessible route to public transportation, remaining inaccessible stations and remaining noncompliant rolling stock all factor into the growth and increased need for paratransit services.  Factor in the expanding senior population and the reduction in community based senior transportation services and it's clear why there is additional need for paratransit services. The question is how do we properly plan and fund for larger paratransit systems that will be required to do more?  The answer cannot be to change the ADA requirements whenever a DOT/FTA triennial review finds an entity is in violation of the ADA and the DOT/FTA rules. How could an entity that just violated the ADA be allowed to change the rules they just violated rather than changing their current policies/procedures to bring their system into compliance with the ADA?  If the DOT/FTA accepted the proposal to change the paratransit fare structure based on Access Services triennial review findings, where would this type of rule change stop? If this strategy is allowed by Access Services we are at risk of losing many of the gains we have made in the past 25+ years of the ADA. Entities that provide public transportation must comply with the ADA requirements, all requirements and the DOT/FTA must enforce the ADA and ensure public transportation is accessible and compliant.  

Access Services was found by DOT/FTA to be in violation of the ADA rules/requirements and as a result, Access Services must change how they calculate paratransit fares to correct the DOT/FTA findings and bring their fare structure into compliance with the ADA. The DOT/FTA must not accept the rulemaking proposal by Access Services for a two tier fare structure and require Access Services to comply with the existing ADA fare requirements; The fare for a trip charged to an ADA paratransit eligible user of the complementary paratransit service shall not exceed twice the fare that would be charged to an individual paying full fare (i.e., without regard to discounts) for a trip of similar length, at a similar time of day, on the entity's fixed route system. The users of paratransit are not responsible for fixed route systems that are not compliant and are also not responsible for reductions in community based transportation services or increases in the senior population all of which have increased the population that uses paratransit.  The costs of paratransit as a result are rising and will continue to rise but making the very population that must use paratransit as their transportation option pay for these increases is not right and must not be allowed. Allowing Access Services and others to use a two tier fare structure to calculate the paratransit fare is nothing more than a fare increase and must not be allowed. The DOT/FTA must therefore deny the proposal by Access Services to change the fare structure and ensure Access Services brings their system into compliance with the ADA.

I'd like to offer my support for the retention of the current fare structure for Los Angeles Access Paratransport system. Thos e that use this system are on a limited and fixed income. The current structure is clear and easy to understand as well as reasonably priced which is important to those individuals on a fixed income. 

As to the matter that it has been found during recent triennial reviews of some fixed route providers that the ADA paratransit fares exceeded twice the fixed route fares then perhaps those routes need to be adjusted separately to resolve the issue. This is the primary mode of transportation for those that use it whether it be to the grocery store, social activities, employment, etc. affordability and simplicity are key elements. ",,,,,,,

We were early and strong proponents of the transportation provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) which includes the right to ADA-complementary paratransit services.      

Ever since the first transportation ADA rulemaking in 1991, Easter Seals has advocated for positions that strike a balance between assuring that the rights of people with disabilities are protected, but that are also based in the reality or operational issues faced by providers.  In fact, we work directly with transit agencies all over the country to develop, perfect and deliver paratransit services and eligibility reviews.  

The requested rulemaking could upset that very delicate balance if not crafted expertly.  We fear the unintended consequences of a rulemaking approach to addressing the concerns raised in the petition.  Given that risk, and the uniqueness of the situation in this specific service area, we urge the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) to work with Access Services in other ways to create a solution to the issue the petition addresses.  We must craft a solution that:
1.	Protects access to paratransit services in Los Angeles County by not raising fares to untenable levels.  Paratransit fares are already a barrier to mobility for many.
2.	Gives Access Services the ability to create a fare structure that is understandable and predictable for riders.
3.	Does not set precedent for other paratransit services to raise fares or in other ways restructure services with implications that would limit mobility for people with disabilities.

While Easter Seals recognizes there is an issue in Los Angeles County that needs to be addressed, we do not necessarily believe a rulemaking is necessary.  We urge DOT to work directly with Access Services, people with disabilities and others affected to create a solution with fewer unintended consequences to the broader paratransit system.  Easter Seals is a willing partner in this effort and would be happy to add our expertise to a specific discussion.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide input and your consideration.

Easter Seals is the leading non-profit provider of services for individuals with autism, developmental disabilities, physical disabilities and other special needs.

Subject: Comments on Access Services Petition for Rulemaking (DOT-OST-2015-0075)

Dear Docket Clerk:

Paratransit, Inc. in Sacramento, California, is writing in support of Access Services Petition for Rulemaking, which proposes to make a small change to the DOT regulations to allow a different methodology for calculating a compliant paratransit fare in a coordinated paratransit system with 20 or more fixed-route members.
Our comments are as follows:

	While the DOT regulations are very clear about how a single fixed-route entity should calculate the maximum-allowable paratransit fare, they are silent on how a coordinated paratransit system, like the one in Los Angeles, with 44 individual fixed-route entities with different fare tables and overlapping service areas, should calculate the maximum-allowable paratransit fare.   In its petition, Access makes a persuasive argument that moving to a so-called dynamic fare system would make it harder for its customers to determine in advance what their fare might be compared to their current two-tier distance-based fare.   This added complexity is not helpful for their customers, many of whom have intellectual and cognitive disabilities.

	I would note that the current Access Services fare system has been in existence for nearly twenty years and is broadly supported by numerous groups that represent and advocate for people with disabilities in Los Angeles County.    Access' Petition is also supported by these groups.

	In general, the Department should be encouraging the creation of coordinated paratransit systems to allow for transfer-free travel by people with disabilities.   By allowing for a different methodology that still adheres to the original ""two-times"" limitation found in the DOT regulations, the Department would be encouraging large geographic areas to form coordinated paratransit systems.   Overall, I believe this would be a net positive for people with disabilities.

Sincerely,


Linda Deavens, Chief Executive Officer

United Spinal Association strongly urges the DOT to deny the petition. 

Founded in 1946 by paralyzed veterans, United Spinal is the largest disability-led nonprofit organization serving and representing the interests of more than a million Americans living with spinal cord injuries and disorders.  United Spinal has dedicated its energy, and programs to improving the quality of life for these Americans of all ages and advancing their independence.  United Spinal has a long history of advocating for equal access to all modes of transportation and was active in advocating for, and the crafting of, the ADAs transportation provisions. 

United Spinal Association recommends denying the petition for the following reasons: (1) the petition request goes against the intent of paratransit under the ADA to ensure equivalent fixed route service, (2) paratransit rates are already too high, (3) approving this petition could lead to unintended rate increases for paratransit riders across the country, (4) the technology is available for operators and passengers to determine rates.  

1. Increased Fares against the Intent of the ADA to Ensure Equal Access to Transportation
ADA paratransit is meant to provide an equivalent and accessible service for individuals who cannot use fixed route service.  Increasing fares will place accessible transportation even farther out of reach for many individuals who rely on paratransit for transportation to work, school, medical appointments, maintain relationships, and to participate in society.   Anecdotal evidence suggests that some people with disabilities utilize paratransit because, while buses are accessible, many subway stations, sidewalks, and bus stops remain inaccessible.  Adverse weather conditions can also lead to inaccessible public rights-of-way and make travel via traditional fixed route service impossible.  Increasing fares when the fixed route system remains inaccessible to many does not ensure access for all.

2. Income is a Barrier: Paratransit Fares are Already Too High
According to an Institute of Medicine Committee on Disability in America report, lower incomes are likely a factor and barrier to adequate transportation for people with disabilities.    Nearly 30% of working age people with disabilities live in poverty (a poverty gap of 15.1 percent compared to individuals without disabilities) and only 34% are employed.   While rates may be increasing across the board for all transit users, people with disabilities should not be expected to pay a disproportionate amount.  Expecting that passengers with disabilities should be able to afford twice the fixed route amount is already unreasonable and goes against the intent of the ADA to ensure access to existing public transportation is available to all.  

3. Amending DOT Regulations Could Lead to Unfair and Increased Rates across the Country
If DOT chooses to amend the ADA rule based on this petition, providers and agencies across the country could begin modifying fare calculations that lead to increased fares.  We understand that transit agencies across the country are facing budget shortfalls across the board.  Disproportionately increasing paratransit fares places the burden of addressing increasing costs on those who have the fewest resources and greatest need.

4. The Amendment is Not Necessary
As noted in comments submitted by the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF), amending the current ADA regulations is not necessary.  Paratransit fares in Los Angeles County only need to be corrected for a few routes. Existing technology could be used to easily calculate fares for drivers and passengers.  New Jersey Transit calculates fares for the entire state.  In addition, Access Services asserts its existing fare structure is simple for riders to understand, implying that the simplest, potentially costlier fare structure should be offered to passengers with disabilities, rather than ensuring the lowest cost, highest quality transportation is made available.  This argument places the onus of a fare structure that exceeds the amount allowed according to existing regulation on the passengers themselves.  People with disabilities should be given the same options and information as passengers using traditional fixed route public transit.  

Deny the Petition Request, Ensure Community Concerns Considered
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the petition to amend the DOT ADA regulation.  Should you decide to consider or allow the petition, we urge you also to meet with opponents of the petition to ensure all perspectives are considered.

RE: Petition to Allow Coordinated Fares for ADA Paratransit (DOT-OST-2015-0075) 

Dear Ms. Thomson: 

Disability Rights Tennessee (DRT) is a private, nonprofit organization which works to end discrimination and protect the civil rights of people with disabilities. DRT is Tennessees federally mandated Protection & Advocacy system. DRT has significant experience protecting the legal rights of persons with disabilities in accessing their communities. DRT has engaged in these efforts through representation of individual clients, collaboration with other disability rights agencies and policymakers, and training initiatives.  

DRT has grave concerns regarding the petition submitted to the Department of Transportation by Los Angeles Countys paratransit provider, Access Services Inc. (ASI). DRT believes this petition for rule making is an inappropriate response to a unique scenario and other means are available to prevent paratransit riders from being charged more than the comparable fixed route fare.   

1. The High Cost of ADA Paratransit Fares Already Limits Full Access to the Community for Many Persons With Disabilities 
DOT must remember that the ADA is a civil rights law. ADA paratransit is intended to be an equivalent service for people with disabilities who are unable to use the fixed route service. 
ADA paratransit fares are already far too high. The current DOT ADA regulation, which requires that ADA paratransit fare not exceed two times the full fixed route bus and/or train fare, should be scrupulously maintained. 
Since the first DOT ADA rulemaking in 1991, the disability community has taken the position that the ADA paratransit fare should be no higher than the full fixed route fare itselfthat is, it should equal to the fixed route fare, not exceed it. At the earliest stage in the development of the ADA, no one anticipated that bus fares would ever rise to the level they are today, nearly 25 years later.  

2. The Situation in Los Angeles County Can be Resolved Without Rulemaking  
Regarding the specific situation in Los Angeles County, the change that Access Services Inc. (ASI), the ADA paratransit provider in L.A. County, is calling for is unnecessary. DRT recommends looking to other complex systems such as New Jersey Transit which have resolved similar issues without resorting to changes in rules.   
  
3. Rulemaking is an Inappropriate Response  The situation in Los Angeles County is an outlier.  Accordingly, rulemaking is an inappropriate response.  If DOT proceeds to amend the ADA rule based on this atypical situation, DOT should exercise care to draft the revision extremely narrowly.  Otherwise, it is likely that transit agencies could utilize the new rule in a way that betters the agencies financial situation at an unfair cost to riders.  

For these reasons, DRT urges DOT to deny this petition.  

Thank you for considering DRTs comments on this issue. We are available to provide additional information as requested.

RE:	Docket No. DOT-OST-2015-0075

Dear Docket Clerk:

The City of Moorpark (Moorpark) appreciates having the opportunity to comment on the proposed Service Criteria for Complementary Paratransit Fares.  Moorpark provides fixed-route and paratransit services for its residents and is a member of the East County Transit Alliance (ECTA) which consists of the Cities of Camarillo, Moorpark, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, and the County of Ventura.  The ECTA works to coordinate transit services between the member agencies.  Recently, the ECTA established a single operator for InterCity ADA and Senior services.

Moorpark is attempting to connect its fixed-route services with the neighboring Cities of Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks.  One issue that will need to be addressed is the fares for complementary paratransit services for the area covered by both transit operators, which can be no more than double the fixed-route fare for the same trip.  Moorpark's fixed-route fare is less than its neighboring cities, which could impact their complementary paratransit fares.  Moorpark is sympathetic with the request from the paratransit operator of our adjacent county (Access Services), to allow use of an averaging method that does not have to meet the requirement of being no more than double the base fixed-route fare for every possible trip.  Moorpark believes that at the end of the day the complementary paratransit customers will greatly benefit from a more simplified and thus more easily-understood paratransit fare structure made possible by this change.

While being sympathetic with Access Services' request, Moorpark would note that it sees no reason why the issues faced in an area having more than 20 fixed-route operators would not exist in other areas such as eastern Ventura County.  The additional flexibility proposed for Los Angeles County would also greatly assist in Moorpark's efforts to provide simplified paratransit fares for its residents.  Moorpark therefore respectfully requests that FTA consider eliminating the threshold for the number of fixed-route operators, to provide all paratransit operators, as well as coordinated or interconnected paratransit services, with an additional tool allowing flexibility to implement simplified fare structures.  Having such flexibility will encourage innovation and cooperation among paratransit operators.  If you would like any additional information or would like to discuss Moorpark's comments, please contact Shaun Kroes, Program Manager, at 805-517-6257.

Sincerely,



Steven Kueny
City Manager

Please grant a waiver to Access Services to allow for a ""coordinated"" or ""two-tier"" fare structure. If Access Services is forced to change their fare structure, the typical rate charged to me would be increased. In addition, some of the trips I take may change in cost depending on the time of the trip. A policy like this will be very difficult for me to keep track of. The role of government should be to keep things simple and understandable, not more complex.

I am an Access Services rider that is 76 years old and has suffered a stroke. I live on nominal social security funding. Any increase fares would make it much tougher to make important trips to my doctor, dentist, and supermarket. I have no other method of transportation. 

I appreciate Access Services for the independence it affords me, and the kindness that the drivers show me. I've ridden with Access Services for 14 years; I value the long-time relationship that I've had with the service and hope that this relationship will remain intact. 

It will be a real hardship for me, should the fares increase and then constantly be changing depending of the time of the trip. Please keep things easy and simple and grant Access Services the waiver they have requested which would allow them to keep its current fare system.

Access covers a very unique service area that is served by over 43 fixed route providers.

Please grant Access' petition and allow our region to maintain the current, two-tiered coordinated fare structure as it is the best match foir our unique region, as has been demonstrated for the last two decades.

I am writing in support of the Access request for a rulemaking change to allow Access to continue use of the current ""Coordinated Fare"" that has been successful for riders and providers in L. A. County for over 20 years. Without a rulemaking change, the ""Coordinated Fare"" cannot continue and Access will initiate a ""Dynamic Fare"" this January. 

For over 44 years I have worked with people with disabilities throughout Los Angeles County, the last 42 yrs.of which have been at United Cerebral Palsy and I serve on various transportation committees including the Access Quality Services Committee and Access Community Advisory Committee.

At the recent community meetings regarding the current Access fare issue, riders and agency representatives repeatedly expressed support for the request for the rulemaking change to allow the continuance of the ""Coordinated Fare"".These individuals and groups have also repeatedly provided clear examples of why the Dynamic Fare would not work well here in Los Angeles County, one of the largest counties with one of the most complex fixed route fare structures in the U.S. To use the Dynamic Fare you would have to find a similar fixed route trip, calculate that fare (as the cost would based on the overly complex fixed route system of the 44 providers in Los Angeles County, a system that most Access riders are not  able to use). The proposed fare for any ride could vary at any of these levels - $0, $.50, $1, $2, $3, $4. per ride with most trips falling into the $3. to $4. range.In L.A. County.

 All of the riders I work with are completely confused by this Dynamic Fare concept. ""It is just too complex, too hard to understand"".  The Los Angeles community of riders, disability agencies and support people are united in requesting a rule change for the following reasons:

1)      The current coordinated fare is easy for people to understand, remember and use independently and has worked for over 20 years! Conversely ""the Dynamic fare is not proven, is not rider friendly, is too complex to use in Los Angeles County, too hard for riders to understand, remember, plan or budget for, too difficult to use and at $4.00 a ride for many of trips, is unaffordable.

2)      The Coordinated Fare has worked for over 20 years; why change now to a fare structure that is more confusing to use especially those who are blind, deaf or those with cognitive, intellectual, memory, or limited speech and those who have difficulty holding on to multiple bills or coins who have physical disabilities. 

3)       ADA eligible paratransit riders qualify for the service due to their inability to use the complex fixed route system, including paying for the rides in that system. With that in mind, L.A. County has
used a Coordinated Fare that is easy to understand and use. ADA transit was created for those individuals who cannot use the fixed route system including the fare structure. ADA provides accommodations for people with disabilities in transit but what about the fare structure for their rides?

4)      The current Coordinated Fare enables riders to use a simple single coupon to pay for the trip so no change is involved. With the Dynamic Fare, each route could be a different fare so multiple coupons would have to be used, making it impossible for some riders to independently pay for their fare.

5)      The current coordinated fare has allowed people of all disabilities to travel throughout the county for all their needs as independently as possible which is in the spirit of the ADA. A majority of Access riders have said they would prefer that the coordinated fare continue than to save a little money on one route only to be charged $4. on another route and would not want Access to use the Dynamic Fare that could result in riders limiting their trips to what they can understand, plan and budget for, restricting them to only the rides they can afford...  does that not constitute a capacity constraint? Who benefits from this change?

I would urge that you consider the Access request, given the complexity of the current fare structure in Los Angeles County 2015 and the need for usability of the fare structure by thousands of people of all disabilities (including those with severe developmental and other disabilities) and amend the regulations to allow the Access Coordinated Fare to continue.


Respectively,

Terri Skidmore Lantz

DOT-OST-2015-0075

The National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery represents people in recovery from serious mental health conditions in policies that affect our lives.  Our member organizations are primarily statewide mental health consumer networks and other peer-run organizations that provide peer support and education to people with serious mental health conditions and provide a collective voice for people served by local and state public mental health systems.

People with psychiatric disabilities are among the largest populations of people with disabilities, and many have extremely low incomes.  Therefore, many of us do not have our own transportation and must depend either on public transportation, or on paratransit because of the nature of our disabilities or medical conditions. We ask DOT to deny the petition of ASI.

Public transit fares are rising rapidly, and especially in large metro areas such as the Washington DC area from where these comments are being submitted.  A round trip ride on Metro Access, for example can cost up to $6.50 in each direction. This is a substantial cost for a person living on SSI or SSDI in a high-cost region who must make a number of trips for services, medical visits, rehabilitation, education and other purposes. Fares for regular Metro rail and bus riders in our region continue to escalate, raising a concern that paratransit fares could rise in concert and become unaffordable for people with disabilities. We oppose the ASI petition for changing fare setting rules because it could result substantial paratransit fare increases without regard to their affordability for people with extremely low incomes. One factor of concern is that housing for people with disabilities in some large suburban metro jurisdictions is clustered in marginal areas that make very long trips necessary, which could boost fares under the proposed method.

We have reviewed the analysis in the comments submitted to DOT by the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund.  The National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery supportst the reasoning of their analysis and their conclusion that there are compelling reasons to maintain the present fare setting rules and to deny the petitioner's request for new rules.  

Thank you very much.

	While the DOT regulations are very clear about how a single fixed-route entity should calculate the maximum-allowable paratransit fare, they are silent on how a coordinated paratransit system, like the one in Los Angeles, with 44 individual fixed-route entities with different fare tables and overlapping service areas, should calculate the maximum-allowable paratransit fare.   In its petition, Access makes a persuasive argument that moving to a so-called dynamic fare system would make it harder for its customers to determine in advance what their fare might be compared to their current two-tier distance-based fare.   This added complexity is not helpful for their customers, many of whom have intellectual and cognitive disabilities.

	I would note that the current Access Services fare system has been in existence for nearly twenty years and is broadly supported by numerous groups that represent and advocate for people with disabilities in Los Angeles County.    Access' Petition is also supported by these groups.

	In general, the Department should be encouraging the creation of coordinated paratransit systems to allow for transfer-free travel by people with disabilities.   By allowing for a different methodology that still adheres to the original ""two-times"" limitation found in the DOT regulations, the Department would be encouraging large geographic areas to form coordinated paratransit systems.   Overall, I believe this would be a net positive for people with disabilities.

Access is a unusual situation and to my knowledge the only organization of its kind.  The ADA is very straight forward in terms of the fare that can be charged.  I understand that Access would like an average fare to make it simpler on them.  However, the issue is complementary paratransit services.  For any trip within the service areas of any transit agency, the fare should be no more than twice the base fare.  Any trip in the LA Metro service area could be up to $3.50 with the LA Metro basic fare being $1.75.  For a trip entirely within the Foothills Transit service area the most that could be charged is $2.50.  For a trip entirely within the Culver City Bus or Big Blue Bus service areas the maximum fare would be $2.00.  With the technology available, when a trip is assigned a fare can be associated with it.  If Access provides a trip that crosses boundaries and is not within a single service area, such a trip is not required by ADA, since it it not complementary.  Access could set any fare it wanted for such a trip.  If a trip were entirely within two service areas, the lower fare would apply.  For example, if a trip in Santa Monica was within 3/4 miles of Line 20 and the Big Blue service area, the fare would be $2.00.

Using average fare is creating a basis for fares not is not necessary if the regulations are followed.",,,,,,,

Unbuckled seat belts and violent turbulence: Open skies and trade
By Martin Edwin Andersen
July 02, 2015

Portrayed in advertising as akin to a chic airborne Bedouin-and-breakfast oasis, three Middle Eastern airlines are wielding power more like 19th century robber barons  exploiting their workers at home while shifting valuable U.S. aviation jobs overseas.

The story behind these state-owned carriers  Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates  shimmers like an illusion in the desert, luring world-weary travelers to the inn of supposedly Open Skies refuge. Incredibly, during a decade in which this trio is estimated to have received more than $42 billion in illegal subsides from the United Arab Emirates and Qatari governments, official U.S. policy has been to embrace the illusion, casting aside our ethical and economic interests in the process.

The issue is disturbingly similar to the all-but-signed Trans-Pacific Partnership, the massive trade agreement riddled with concerns about enforceable labor standards, subsidization, non-discrimination and other international norms. While the Middle Eastern Open Skies saga deserves attention in its own right, the lessons it teaches on the dangers of rushed and insufficiently transparent trade deals are needed now more than ever. After all, at the heart of the TPP debate has been the question of fast-track authority. By prioritizing speed over deliberation, once more the United States risks reliance on misconceptions, both skillful and willful. Let us instead actively revisit the errors of Open Skies in the hope that by righting one wrong, far greater harms might be averted. 

Currently, U.S. legacy airlines  American, Delta and United  face competitors with unfettered access to the worlds oldest democracy, a phenomenon fueled by ill conceived and rapidly negotiated bilateral agreements. All this generosity, however, has served only to displace U.S. airline market share. While Delta and United each offer only a single daily flight to Dubai and none to Abu Dhabi, Emirates alone flies to nine U.S. cities from its Dubai hub, now the worlds busiest travel nexus. 

Open Skies was meant to limit government interference in airlines commercial decisions. Implemented fairly, everyone prospers. But with the Gulf Statess near-monopoly, Open Skies has become open seasonon U.S. jobs, U.S. values and basic common sense. 

Just this month, the United Nationss International Labor Office found Qatar Airlines violated international law by flagrantly disrespecting womens rights. CEO Akbar Al Baker responded: I dont give a damn about the ILO. Perhaps this arrogance shouldnt come as a surprise. Human Rights Watch has been pointing out for years that Qatari law codifies discrimination against women. Even marital rape is permitted. 

Other labor abuses in the UAE and Qatar border on slavery; free speech is a profile left to the truly courageous; and ethnic, social and religious prejudices evoke the worst of the Confederate-flag-waving Jim Crow South. The Wall Street Journal recently noted that Emirates Airlines faces its most difficult labor challenges to date due to expanded shifts, restrictions on dress and mistreatment by supervisors  plus the fact that unions are illegal. While in the region, Secretary of State John Kerry correctly stated that such gross inequity rips and tears at the fabric of the rule of law.

In both Qatar and the UAE, the LGBT community faces state terror: In the former, gay relationships are punishable by death, while in Qatarnow mired in the FIFA scandal2022 World Cup fans were told they might be screened to detect homosexuality.

With one of the worlds smallest native populations  slightly more than a quarter-million  Qatar has the largest percentage, 88 percent, of non-nationals. Counting only native citizens, it is the worlds wealthiest nation. This begs the question: Aside from subsidizing airlines and constructing artificial island playgrounds, where does all that money go? David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee, recently described Qatar as the ATM for jihadist groups. ...

The Hadith (the sayings of Muhammad) points to the manumission of slaves as one of the most meritorious deeds available for the expiation of sins. Let us help ourselves, as well as the peoples of Qatar and the UAE, to do just that, opening the sky only for those who repent.

Im sure it is good for their economic development, but that is like working the system of the Open Skies Agreement to get an unfair advantage.  Its important that all players play by the rules.
Their national subsidies have resulted in a huge increase in subsidized Gulf carrier capacity, beyond what that region's markets would be expected to generate.
More passengers are using the subsidized carriers, and what will result is an artificial reduction in U.S. airline service because of fewer local and connecting passengers. 
My request to the Dept. of Commerce is that you open consultations with the governments of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates and address the reported $42 billion in subsidies and other unfair state benefits these Gulf carriers receive.

The non-subsidized airlines of the US and Europe are destined to lose market share to the Middle East airlines with artificially low fares that result from this.  The loss of market share will drive reduced service/frequency, profits, and, ultimately, airline employee jobs.

The benefit of having fair play rules, like the Open Skies Agreement or a ban on steroids, is that it allows for a naturally competitive market. When we allow air lines that are subsidized by billions upon billions of dollars by their prospective governments to move into the U.S. market, we are essentially opening the U.S. market to cheaters. Now, not decades down the road, but now, is the time for the U.S. Government to establish a precedent for the kind of game we want to be playing when it comes to the air lines. Do we want a game where we allow the players with the deepest pockets, or best steroids, to be dominating the field, or a match between self-made competitors on an even playing field? When we allow foreign governments to influence our industries, we diminish one of this country's greatest economic benefits: a free market. Please consider the implications of allowing these foreign carriers to go unchecked and the damage it will do to an American industry that is still recovering from the tragedies of September Eleventh, an industry that has become heritage for this great country.

I'm a pilot for Delta and a retired AF Veteran of nearly 25 years. I am concerned that governmental subsidies have allowed Gulf airines to rapidly expand to the point
where they pose a threat to U.S. airlines, businesses big and small to further exand their economies beyond oil and gas.

Resounding evidence shows that, the state owned Qatar Airlines, Etihad Airways and Emirates Airline have
collectively received over $40 billion in government subsidies in the last decade. Together with the
subsidies, these unfair advantages virtually eliminate cost concerns for the Gulf airlines and fuels
massive growth in their fleet size and the number of routes they serve. The Gulf carriers have added
new capacity at rates that far exceed market demand. In order to fill this excess capacity on
international routes, they take passengers and revenues from U.S. airlines. In response, the big three
American carriers- American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines will be forced off routes or will
reduce their service.

I am simply asking we level the playing field to ensure the ME3 abides by the Open Skies Treaty.  I will happily compete with them on a level buisness playing field, but with their subsidies the odds are heavily in their favor.  

When air service is lost or reduced jobs are lost. Every daily international roundtrip flight lost by the U.S.
airlines to the Gulf carriers equates to more than 800 good-paying U.S. jobs lost. Job loss will not be
limited to cities with large international airports  Atlanta, Detroit, New York and, but smaller cities throughout
the United States with regional airports that depend on regular service to the hubs of U.S. carriers.

Business owners and employees here are working hard to be successful. They should not be punished by the actions
of Gulf States. I am requesting that the U.S. government open consultations with Qatar and United Arab
Emirates in order to address the flow of subsidized capacity into the U.S. market. I also believe that the

They present a very real threat to american jobs to which Airlines in the US have no real market response.

Please consider the impact that heavily subsidized gulf carriers have on an unsubsidized, free market. The policy was put in place for a reason and should be enforced.

Please don't misunderstand. Competition is a pillar of capitalism and is absolutely vital. But a free market company cannot compete in a situation like this. The gulf carriers have no responsbility because all losses are covered by their government.

How can a carrier that is not state subsidized survive in a cuthroat competitive environment. 
US owned carriers are responsible for transporting and improving the country's economy by infusing much needed funds by each eligible traveler. 

In an environment where US owned carriers have consolidated in order to ensure survival, the US Government is essentially bleeding out the US carriers and promoting non US carriers. If this action continues, you will be hard pressed to see a US carrier remain in business. US carriers can not competitively compete against a Gulf Carrier that has deep pockets.

As I am sure you are aware, Emirates, Qatar, and Etihad receive $42 Billion from their governments to pay for their aircrafts, in doing so, they intentionally flood their markets with capacity as to beat out any remaining competition.  They receive no consequences for their actions; absolutely no financial penalties are pushed upon them for doing so.  
This issue directly impacts not only Atlanta citizens, but the U.S. as a whole. For every new route added by these airlines, 800 U.S. jobs are at stake. The President of the United States recently stated: We need only look to the Middle East and North Africa to see that large numbers of young people with no jobs and stifled voices can fuel instability and disorder."" The fueled instability can be seen in the uselessly fully fueled jets they are flying the most popular destinations, stealing, from the rest of worlds markets. Soon, if Emirates, Qatar, and Etihad are not penalized for their actions, they will dominate the U.S. markets as well. 
I hope to see shortly in the future control taken on this manner. Many U.S. jobs are in jeopardy. If these airlines are not fiscally punished for their behavior, we will reward them with entrance into the United States of Americas well running industry. A colossal collapse of the industry and surely an economic decline on travel would instantly result.

Carriers of the Persian Gulf States (such as Emirates and Etihad) have been been adding dozens of new routes and frequency of flights at a rate far greater than any other Flag Carrier in the world.  The current world airline market does not support such risky business ventures.  But for the Persian Gulf carriers, it appears that the financial risk is being assumed (funded) by their host governments.  This is unfair competition, and unless it is stopped, the U.S. airlines will suffer greatly.  Thousands of U.S. jobs will be lost if U.S. airlines reduce international flying because they can't compete with the government-subsidized Gulf carriers.  The U.S. airline industry is a giant economic engine, and brings in astounding amounts of revenue to the U.S. Treasury in taxes and fees.

Every improvement comes off the backs of over 80,000 employees at Delta Air Lines so that our company can stay in business and provide jobs for us.  Our livelihood depends on the ability to make profits.  If our competition is afforded subsidies, then profit really isn't an issue for them.  All the customer improvements are in essence paid for by these subsidies, thus creating an unfair advantage over the US carriers.  We, as a profit driven company, cannot fairly compete against those carriers who are given this money.

My name is Ivan Ramon and I am a Delta Employee. I wanted to comment on this issue because my job may be in jeopardy due to the unfair competition that these gulf airlines have against the aitlines in the US; Against my Air Line.
Gulf carriers are clearly a result of the massive amount of Oil money these countries have. You can see it on their cities, on the major advancements in their technology and how they have become competitive in the market place out of nowhere. Delta Air Lines for example, have been flying since the 1940's. Emirates or Quatar Airways?  Since 1985 and 1993 respectively. You can see how they started flying right when their countries became super wealthy with their oil. And like everything in their countries, they have been built by their royal families, ergo, the government. How fair is it for an ""independent"" and ""private"" company to get an approximately 40 BILLION subsidy? That is ridiculous! If any company in any market got a 40 billion dollar subsidy from the government, there is no way it could fail. Quite the contrary, they would be in an unfair position to compete with other companies in the world. Now, these company want to come to the US and steal the routes that Hard working American companies currently posses, won by fair competition between Airline companies in the world then that should not be allowed. Its time our government steps in to protect its companies and its peopole from these unfair airline companies that want to come and steal our routes, our jobs with support from their Oil tycoon governments.

Please help! Our jobs are on the line!

Thank you.",,,,,,,

We are using U.S. tax payer monies to give lower finance rates to foreign carriers when purchasing aircraft and it gives them a huge advantage to compile superior fleets at exceptional prices. This put the U.S. airline industry at risk, especially as we take a big picture, long-term view. U.S. airlines have long been world leaders in this industry as they have compiled the best safety records. The U.S. airline industry is a vital part of the U.S. economy, providing thousands of quality, high-paying jobs and is a chief economic catalyst as people travel by aircraft to accomplish the countries business. As Open Skies continues to expand it is vital to this industries survival that the playing field is level. The U.S. airlines need competitive aircraft financing to update their fleets and compete on a global basis. The forecast for the demand on air travel is continued and widespread growth worldwide as countries improve their own economies in developing areas of the world so this means the U.S. airlines have the opportunity to provide more U.S. jobs in the future through continued growth. That has to be both provided and safeguarded.  We cannot slip in an area that we already have so much expertise and brand recognition in, we must invest in continuing to grow U.S. airlines and safeguard those jobs in place. We have to legislate a fair playing field for all the worlds airlines so competition can still exist with fairness yet we should also promote our airlines just like we do our banks, car companies, and other companies that are of interest to the U.S. economy and way of life.",,,,,,,

Thousands of jobs in the Minneapolis area depend on the long term success of Delta.  I have proudly lobbied in Washington, DC on behalf of Delta and the Communities it serves and I strongly encourage the U.S. government to respond to violations of Open Skies policy by the Gulf carriers, and to know that American jobs - like mine - are at risk if the government fails to act now on this critical matter.  I, and my colleagues at Delta, along with the other legacy carrier's employees, ask for fair competition - a level playing field.  

Together we can ensure a level playing field for American Carriers and others who seek financing through the Ex/Im Bank who compete with other US companies and the men and women who work for Delta.

When we allow air lines that are subsidized by billions upon billions of dollars by their prospective governments to move into the U.S. market, we are essentially opening the U.S. market to cheaters. Now, not decades down the road, but now, is the time for the U.S. Government to establish a precedent for the kind of game we want to be playing when it comes to the air lines. Do we want a game where we allow the players with the deepest pockets, or best steroids, to be dominating the field, or a match between self-made competitors on an even playing field? When we allow foreign governments to influence our industries, we diminish one of this country's greatest economic benefits: a free market. Please consider the implications of allowing these foreign carriers to go unchecked and the damage it will do to an American industry that is still recovering from the tragedies of September Eleventh, an industry that has become heritage for this great country.",,,,,,,

The U.S. government MUST respond to violations of Open Skies policy by the Gulf carriers. If you fail to act, American jobs are at stake. Safety is at stake.  Research shows clear parallels from the decline of the domestic shipbuilding industry in the 80s-90s to the present-day trade dispute with the subsidized carriers. Qatar, Etihad and Emirates have received more than $42 billion in subsidies and other unfair benefits from their government owners in the past decade, in violation of Open Skies agreements. The effects of foreign subsidization on our economy are substantial and detrimental, as jobs that are lost do not come back. Portions of the industrial base can be eroded, devastating companies and communities. If these foreign carriers are successful in shifting traffic from American companies to their own, then American aviation will suffer. If this foreign, subsidized capacity remains unregulated, the U.S. aviation industry will be decimated by a loss of almost 200,000 jobs, when considering losses from passenger traffic and those jobs supported by passenger aviation. So I hope the U.S. government will act on this issue of subsidized Gulf carriers distoring the global marketplace, and threatening our economy, jobs, communities, and families. Thank you",,,,,,,

I am a mechanic employed by a major airline. I am also in the military and have been to the countries that compete for our domestic business. We have been through bankruptcy and have come out stronger but lost major benefits and a large partion of our retirements forever and substantial pay cuts at the time. These other airlines do not have to face bankruptcy or see driving competition to keep cost down to stay competitive. This is a delicate issue with global cooperation with allies and political relationships that are important. I have four children and a wife. We have now started putting our 1st through college and God has graciously alllowed us to help her, through my income and no student loans so far. My shop now has 12 less people that last year and we are doing 20% more work which proves how competitive we are. Our healthcare has gone up over 80 percent in the last few years. I would ask that you consider keeping unfair competition in check because we are doing our part in being more productive with less people. We monitor our health diligently and are driving those cost down also. I know international relationships are delicate and sometimes difficult to maintain, I am just asking and praying for your wisdom as you make these decisions affecting domestic jobs in a prudent manner. Thank You

All three of them are usually there with their great big airplanes. What is always odd is that they seam to be boarding very few passengers compared to other airlines but they keep flying the routes and expanding their presents in the world. It appears that they are getting their money to operate from some other places besides passengers.

How can my airline and other airlines around the world compete with them? It is very difficult to understand why they are allowed to fly to the United States under and open skys agreement and take costumers away from Airlines that must rely on their own means to pay for such things as ""Fuel"", ""Wages"" ""Aircraft"" and other operating expenses.

We must keep our airlines healthy so they can compete fairly in the world market.

Re: Open and Fair Skies Policy
Dear Secretary Foxx:

The Houston Airport System and United Airlines have been strong partners with the North Houston Association for more than a decade. We have worked closely with these partners to help further the growth of the North Houston region.

It has come to our attention that a small group of state-owned airlines in the Arabian Gulf (Gulf carriers) are alleged to be receiving substantial subsidies from their governments, which would violate the longtime Open Skies policy designed to foster healthy competition.

While we recognize that the Gulf carriers play a key role in this growth, the legacy US carriers should be given an equal opportunity to provide service along the same routes as the Gulf.

The North Houston Association urges the federal government to investigate these allegations, and, if proven to be true, take appropriate action by opening a dialogue with the governments of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to address such subsidies.

Sincerely,

Alex Sutton 			        Jon Lindsay
Chairman of the Board 		President

U.S. airlines face questionable financing and opaque managements unwilling to fully disclose subsidies being paid by their respective governments.

Hello.  With respect to the US airlines (American, Delta, and United) protest of current US Government Open Skies policy with respect to the Mideast carriers (Emirates, Ethiad, and Qatar), I urge the DOT to carefully consider the issue and re-evaluate our Government's current position on Open Skies with the Mideast carriers.   I urge the DOT to respond, and address head-on, the valid and important allegations made by the US carriers with respect to the obvious and material violations of our Open Skies policy by the Mideast carriers.  It should come as no surprise here that with respect to the current, ongoing, gross violations of our Open Skies policy by the Mideast carriers, important and valuable and numerous jobs here in the US are directly at stake.  Jobs both within the US airline industry, and like all big industries in the US and around the world, jobs in all of the industries built up and operated to support the US airlines, which provide incalculable benefits to the American public in terms of providing efficient and fast global air transportation.  I believe the case here, on its face, is immediately obvious, and on that basis alone I urge the DOT to respond immediately to the Open Skies policy violations by the Mideast carriers.  That such violations are obvious, and immediately harmful, is clear:  how on earth could just one airline of the three (Emirates), operate out of a massive airport in the desert, and be currently building another, and operate/have on order over 140 Airbus 380 aircraft, which can seat over 600 passengers in their current two class configuration.  Where are these tens of thousands of people who are going to fly on these aircraft?  In Dubai?  Hardly, with a population of merely 2 million?  It is on its face absolutely obvious, and the whole scheme is clearly absurd to anyone who looks at this issue.  The US airlines are vital to our country, and have struggled for decades post deregulation.  They receive no assistance from the US government, even in the face of our government providing massive subsidies to certain industries in the US (eg, farm subsidies).  The US airline industry is forced to stand on its own and compete globally like most companies in the US.  But with the Mideast carriers, how do they possibly have the hundreds of billions of dollars required to buy all these massive expensive new aircraft - answer:  through government subsidies to these carriers.  How on earth do they intend to make a profit flying these massive, fuel intensive, expensive aircraft, when common airline industry analysis shows that it is the fare for the last and final seat on a 100 seat aircraft that provides a profit, whereas the other 99 seats merely permit the carrier to cover its operating costs?  If Emirates does not fill their 140 500-600 seat A380s (75000) seats every single day on every flight, they will not turn a profit - but why should they care!  They are not competing on the global stage, they are wholly-funded by the state and their operating costs and paid for through state subsidies.  This puts our US carriers and other global airlines, who do have to compete, earn back their cost of capital and answer to shareholders, at a great disadvantage.  Especially when the Mideast carriers have a very small base population and native passengers of their own ... so they will just poach the passengers flying US airlines, which is frankly an attack on our country and must be repelled.  I urge the DOT to take up immediate review of this gross violation of our current Open Skies policy by these Mideast carriers.  The US airline industry, and all of the millions of jobs it creates and supports, is vital to the national security and national interest of the US, and vital to providing and maintaining efficient and affordable air transportation for the 300 million plus US citizens. Thank you.",,,,,,,

We can remove their ability to receive loans to buy Boeing aircraft that U.S. carriers cannot receive.  We can also respond strongly to the constant violations of the Open Skies policy into the U.S.  The Gulf carriers have already decimated the competition on the Asia to Europe routes and are poised to do the same on routes to the United States.

The National Minority Supplier Development Council works to advance business opportunities for certified Asian, Black, Hispanic and Native American business enterprises. We connect these businesses to our corporate members in an effort to increase procurement and enhance supplier diversity.

As an organization, our leadership and members are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact of government subsidies and other unfair benefits that have been provided to state-owned airlines of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the last decade.

Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates Airline have collectively received at least $42 billion in government subsidies and other unfair benefits in violation of U.S. Open Skies policy. These subsidies are contributing to excess capacity, which draws passengers and revenue from U.S. airlines. If U.S.-based airlines continue to lose market share, this uneven playing field will lead to service cuts and job losses. Experts believe that each route that is lost to Qatar, Etihad or Emirates will result in an average net loss of 821 good, high-paying U.S. jobs.

If the US government does not act, minority-owned small businesses will feel the effects of these job losses through fewer contract opportunities and lower revenues. Ultimately, our regional economies will suffer as supply chains will be less robust and competitive.

The U.S. Census Bureau stated that, Minority-owned firms are an engine of job creation, demonstrating the highest levels of new job growth and company formation compared to non minority-owned firms. Minority-owned firms generate over $1 trillion in economic output in this country and are part of the backbone of the American economy. The big three U.S. carriers, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines all understand this critical work. They are members of our organization and have helped to shape the global supplier diversity landscape. United Airlines alone spent over $1.1 billion with diverse suppliers. 

On behalf of our members and constituents, I urge the U.S. government to not impede the growth of small, minority-owned firms that are so crucial to our countrys economic growth and open consultations with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in order to address the huge subsidies that those nations provide their state-owned airlines. NMSDC also believes that the U.S. government should seek a freeze on the introduction of new passenger service by the Gulf carriers during these consultations.  

Sincerely,
Joset Wright-Lacy
President

The US major airlines are the first to ring the alarm bell but other airlines are affected as well.  In the USA we have embraced the idea of fair competition.  We did not endorse South Korea dumping below cost steel on the US market and we should not allow the Gulf carriers to pull off their version of the SK steel dump either.  The Gulf carriers try to equate US bankruptcy protection laws with their version of subsidies and equity stakes, with one glaring flaming exception.  BANKRUPTCY LAWS APPLY TO ALL BUSINESSES IN THE US.  Only the Gulf carriers benefit from their country's subsidies, fee waivers, interest free loans, and equity stakes.  When a loan will NEVER BE REPAID, it is not a loan.  
This directly affects a rare success story in the United States.  Aviation related jobs in the US are multi-generational. Pilots and flight attendants fly for the same companies their parents worked for.  These are good paying labor jobs where someone with a clean record can make a decent income without being a member of upper management.  Families depend on these jobs in New York, Miami, Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Melbourne Florida, San Antonio and Shreveport.  The point is in many cities in America, these are the top labor jobs in the area.  We used to say the same thing about the maritime shipping industry.  Now, the Maritime industry in America is generally shrimpers and lobstermen, fighting for scraps on run down boats while Filipinos and other third world nationals work for wages we pay at Wendy's. 

Airline workers pay taxes and contribute to American society.  Airline workers lead their families by example and teach the nobility of labor, buy going to work and bringing home a living wage. Unfair competition by the Gulf carriers (to be honest, their governments) threaten this multi-generational industry in America. The choice before you is clear.  Do you want to support American families or Qatari investors and foreign workers?  

One other issue before you is something not often mentioned, but literally the elephant in the room no one discusses.  The huge US military base in Doha Qatar is whispered about but not really addressed.  Let's be clear.  We defend the entire region there Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, UAE; from the Iranians and provide stability for their monarchies.  Please do not allow the sacrifices from American servicemen (who overwhelmingly come from working class American families) to be used against our interests in dealing with the Gulf carriers.  It would be especially galling to have the parents of American servicemen, serving at Al Udeid AB in Qatar get furloughed as a result of your lack of action.  We provide a needed service to the Gulf region by stationing our sons and daughters in the region.  Do not allow the issue of Al Udeid to be used against the parents of the American servicemen in the region or the Reservists and Guardsmen that work in US Airlines.  

Arrogant and misinformed politicians will tell us, ""you dont understand the bigger issues"".  We do understand, and we expect you to help defend our jobs from unfair foreign competition.",,,,,,,

These subsidies allow the carriers, not only to grow through expansion of aircraft fleets and flying into new foreign markets, but while doing so, making it possible to keep their tickets prices below market value making it more difficult for US and Europen carriers to compete and in doing so these Gulf carriers are capturing market share from carriers who have been in these markets for many years.  The gulf carriers are not creating new market share, they are just capturing it from carriers like DELTA, American and United and that is hurting the US carriers ability to compete fairly in these foreign markets. Competition on a level playing field is what the Open Skies Agreement is about and these carriers need to be investigated for their violations of that agreement.  THEIR VIOLATIONS are threatening the future viability of a strong US Airline industry that is able to serve its vast domestic markets as well as destinations around the globe.  
Please support your US airline industry...investigate these Gulf Carriers now..
Thank you for attention to this immensely important subject.

As a longtime U.S. airline employee, I emphatically request that the DOT do a thorough inspection of the state owned airlines against the requirements of the ""Open skies"" treaties.  These airlines and perhaps others are in violation of the original agreements by providing funding from the state's treasury, rather than normal competition based revenues.  Their actions provide an out of balance playing field and the subsidies need to stop.  Additionally, these airlines should be fined if found to violate the terms of the treaties.

This should be the slogan we rally around regarding the abuses of the ""Open Skies"" agreement.  In our country we embrace a free market economy, so long as it is realitively fair.
Why?  Because we view ourselves as a land of opportunity, where anyone can make something of themselves if they work hard enough.  Is life always fair? No, but we have made great strides to protect the individual from being run over by unfair competition- such as monopolies and bribes.  

The airlines in the United States do not receive the same favorable loans and subsidies that the gulf carriers do, which gives them an unfair competitive advantage.  One only need to look to the European and Australian carriers, to see how their international business has been decimated by this unfair advantage.  We are next unless we renegotiate a truly fair agreement.  To not do so would be to risk loosing hundreds of thousands of airline jobs, revenue, and even national security.  
The loss of jobs, and revenue is obvious, and so should the fact that our government relies upon our domestic airlines to transport the bulk of of troops all over the world in times of conflict.  What happens to this uplift capability if the gulf carriers take over international travel?  

For the above mentioned reasons we must renegotiate the ""Open Skies Agreement"" and make it truly a level playing field, 
too much is at risk not to!

Please do the right thing.

Thank you,

I ask that you review and amend where necessary the Open Skies agreement between the United States and the countries of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The final agreement should ensure fair competition. Without fair competition the airline industry of the United States will become like the shipping industry of the United States, practically nonexistent.

The EX-IM Bank Giving access to billions of dollars of low-cost loans to other foreign airlines such as Emirates and Qatar the purpose of low cost financing of aircraft is directly hurting our U.S. Airlines because the cost of aircraft acquisition is so much higher and therefore the cost of doing businessis so much greater.  This directly affects what US airlines must charge  for tickets and therefore directly affects their ability to attract and retain customers vs. their subsidized competition.  Being one of the most important industries in the United States the airline industry accounts for over 10% of GDP when considering the US airline industry and all the complementary and flow-through business these airlines support.   The US airline industry is the model for the rest of the world and sets the bar high for professionalism and  safety standards. We must not weaken our US airlines for it takes many years & a lifetime of dedication for someone to become an airline pilot such as myself.   These just are not jobs these are very serious professions that have many lives at stake and we cannot afford to lose the strength of this most important US industry.  Our country needs and deserves the very best safe and strong  US airline industry.  This can be done by allowing US carriers to compete effectively by denying any further foreign carrier US subsidies through the EX-IM  Bank to and allow them to compete on a level playing field.",,,,,,,

bad press by saying ""we'll skip Boeing and buy Airbus next time..."" is hollow rhetoric.  

Look at the facts, Boeing is pushing 50+ 737's a month out of their factories, in addition to B-777 freighters, B-787 Dreamliners, 
B-747-8 Freighters, 100+ KC-46's for the Air Force, and over 100 more aircraft for FedEx.

Don't allow their unbridled growth (through government subsidies) to kill off American jobs in the airline industry.  We need to 
protect the travelers by protecting the American workers who provide that service!

Not only are airline jobs at risk, for me and my colleagues at Delta Air Lines, but large numbers of American jobs can be negatively impacted if our government fails to act on these violations.  

The Gulf Carriers have an unfair competitive advantage flying nonstop to many markets in the United States however the US network carriers (Delta, American & United) have very limited service into this region on a nonstop basis from the US.  They are saturating the US market with seats and routes that aren't supported by the capital market.  In contrast they have prevented the US carriers from providing similar service into the Gulf region which is a violation of the Open Skies policy.  

As these carriers dominate several US markets it causes the US carriers to react by reducing or eliminating service (as we have already done here at Delta).  This change in service not only has a negative impact on airline jobs but the thousands of ancillary businesses that support the airline and the operation.  These are American jobs that are at risk from the aggressive expansion plans of the Gulf Carriers.

I urge our US government to take action quickly to review these violations of the Open Skies policy by the Gulf Carriers to prevent any additional loss of American jobs to the foreign competition.

It has been proven on numerous occasions that sate-owned airlines are heavily subsidized which gives them a huge advantage over US airlines.  They are able to undercut current fares, provide services which are cost prohibitive and undermine free competition with US carriers since they are not responsible for making a profit without the help of their governments.  In addition, if allowed to continue to fly without respect to the open skies agreement, US jobs were be severely threatened and in the end will cause catastrophic results to the travel industry and the thousands of  individuals employed in this industry.  In addition, competition will dwindle and in the end, fares will be much higher than they are today.  Lastly, the US government will lose the ability to protect its citizens from unfair practices in the travel industry.  

Therefore, I am asking that the US government to respond to the violations of the Open Sky agreement currently occurring.  The livelihood of thousands is at risk if the US government does not respond.  Thank you.  ",,,,,,,

My name is Sean Bradford

I am an airline pilot with Delta Air Lines.  I am writing to urge  you to  respond to the violation of the Open Skies policy by the Gulf carriers such as Emirates, Eithad and Qatar Airlines.  These foreign air carriers are being subsidized by their respective governments.  This has resulted in absolutely unfair competition against our U.S. airlines to include Delta. 

Unless these carriers are required to adhere to the open skies policy and compete fairly with our U.S. airline industry we will lose hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States.  Additionally, our U. S. airline fleet is of strategic importance to national defense as it participates in the CRAF (Civil Reserve Air Fleet) in times of national crisis.  Our airlines must remain in business and healthy in order to be there when our country calls

We have the best most competitive airline industry in the world. We can compete with any other airlines as long as the playing field is fair.  Please do what is right by our nation and its citizens and require these foreign airlines to compete under the same rules that our own airlines abide by.

Thank you,
Sean Bradford",,,,,,,

Having observed the open skies debate and grievance submitted by the ""Big 3"" American carriers, I can only observe that their intentions are driven by the realization that they are and have well and truly missed an opportunity. They failed to effectively plan a strategy which took into account the emergence of a rapidly growing source market in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. They failed to effectively plan for route expansion and aircraft to compete on those routes and quite honestly the lack of strategy and planning is appaling. Now, having realised they missed a beat, they would like to enter those markets by asking for government intervention. Effectively they want government to shut down competition so that they can then move into the routes. 
Really, they should enter the markets and compete. They have had plenty of opportunity to do so. If they had had the market intelligence, the courage, the fleet, then they would have been able to gain first mover status on all of those routes. Fact is, they were so wrapped up in creating a commodity on their own domestic markets, that they failed to realise a growing middle class in India, China, South East Asia, East Africa and of course a youth bubble in the Middle East. Their lack  of understanding of potential source markets should embarrass them. Yet, they fail to admit to past strategic failures, they dream up a whole host of 'excuses' and rather than be held accountable for their strategic failures, they are asking for help!

This is and should not be the behaviour of what should be respectable CEO's. They should be pouring their energy into their businesses, focusing their teams on how to grow, how to bring a better fleet, how to drive service and how to drive prices up, not commoditise their offering. As great American leaders, they should not cry and bleet like children, they should step up to the plate, offer dynamic, brave strategies, designed to win market share and customers. 
Friends in Government, your Airline leaders are failing the people of America, the people should be embarrased of them. You are a country who should make things happen, you are the epitome of the capitalist system, you want to compete and you want to win. You cannot complain when you miss the boat, you have to take that on the chin, rise again and design strategies to win. These CEO's just don't like having one over them. Their predecessors are the guilty ones. They had no-one taking care of future forecasting back in 2002/3. When the GCC countries employed American futurists to map out the next 20 years, the American airlines couldn't see past their back garden. That's the real story of how this happened. 
The corporate world is littered with companies which failed to effectively plan for expansion. Your airlines fit into that area. 

Allow me to reiterate, this has nothing to do with open skies, this has to do with airlines wanting a slice of a huge Pie that they initially failed to identify as Huge. Now they are crying.

""It is the policy of the Board to consider the practice of an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent, of stating to a prospective passenger by telephone or other means of communication that a reservation of space on a scheduled flight in air transportation is confirmed before a passenger has received a ticket specifying thereon his confirmed reserved space, to be an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition in air transportation...""

American Airlines' own internal general rules define ""ticket"" as:

""The 'passenger ticket and baggage check,' including all flight, passenger, and other coupons therein, issued by carrier, which provide for the carriage of the passenger and his baggage.""

When American Airlines (or any airline) issues an ""electronic ticket"" to a customer (an ""other means of communication"" from the perspective of 14 CFR 399.83), much of that information is missing, leaving the consumer at a disadvantage if the terms of the ticket are brought into question.

Allowing an airline to ignore this rule leads to a situation where one party to the contract of carriage (the airline) is able to set and enforce non-negotiable and undisclosed conditions against the other party (the passenger).  The airlines have historically been more than willing to enforce these terms when it is to their advantage, yet the passenger - to whom these conditions were never disclosed - is unable to enforce these same conditions against the airline, or even defend himself from the airline's enforcement.

This is not a new concern.  Indeed, 14 CFR 399.83 was put in place to protect consumers from exactly this sort of deceptive practice.  Airlines cannot be allowed to pick and choose which rules they will follow and which they will ignore -- doubly so if they cannot be relied upon to follow even their own rules.

It seems fair that their e-ticketing documents provide this pricing breakdown information, especially since it appears to both be required by existing rules and that providing that information is not burdensome, since it already exists in the Sabre system.

To be honest, I'd always had great faith in American Airlines ability to charge appropriate taxes and fees, but, now that mistakes seem to have occurred, I need enough information that I can double-check the specific taxes and fees on my tickets in future.

In my opinion, airlines should follow the provisions contained in 14 CFR 399.83, and the DOT should enforce them.  Otherwise, the flying public has no recourse against airline fraud, misrepresentations, and mistakes regarding ticket terms (and pricing).

It is well known that U.S. airlines, notably American, United, and Delta routinely attempt to defraud (yes, defraud), or otherwise take advantage of their passengers.  Other than the tarmac rule, passengers have little, if no recourse against predatory carriers.

Based on the foregoing, I respectfully urge you to enforce the provisions of 14 CFR 399.83 against American Airlines in this case, and require that it provide a ticket to Mike Borsetti and all other passengers.

Sincerely,

Many aspects of travel depend on information that is not disclosed on American's confirmations, and while I can usually get the information by calling them, this isn't useful when written proof is needed.  

The lack of fare basis codes makes it impossible to determine the refund rules, eligibility for upgrades, eligibility for premium seating, and eligibility for frequent flyer mileage accrual.  The baggage allowance is also important; under the rules of a ticket I once purchased from American I was entitled to three pieces of baggage on my entire itinerary (because a trans-Atlantic segment was ticketed in first class).  My return itinerary included an intra-Europe segment on British Airways that had no first class cabin, and I was permitted only two pieces at check-in.  While the website confirmed my entitlement to three, the agent was unwilling to check, and lacking documentation proving my entitlement to three, I was unable to check the third piece.  If I had had a paper ticket, it would have indicated the allowances for each segment.

I believe that all airlines should be required to provide as part of a ticket confirmation, all of the information that may be needed to prove what we have purchased.  For DOT to rule otherwise means that the carriers can change the rules at their whim without any knowledge on our part.

Imagine that, in deciding this case, you are modeling the most basic of concepts to a group of impressionable youngsters (America's future caretakers):  rules need to be followed by everyone for the beneficial outcome of everyone.  When one side or the other refuses to meet their obligations (contract) they are displaying bullying behavior.

The unwillingness of American to provide all the information comprising my ticket have meant that when making changes to my ticket I am unable to ascertain if the applicable fare rules, collected taxes, and other charges have been properly calculated and applied. I purchased a Round-the-World ticket and the rules are quite complicated, that even American insists that these tickets be handled by a specialized desk. During the times of paper tickets, one had physical coupons that contained all the information necessary for a consumer to ascertain what they were paying for and the details of the contract between the carrier and passenger. However, with the move to e-tickets all that information is held by the airline and a passenger is forced to accept whatever is communicated over the phone, no written records to later review or challenge, it results in the airline holding all the power on a ticket. This means a passenger is beholden to whatever the whim of the agent on the other end of the phone despite what the applicable rules and regulations may be for their ticket.

Disclosing the details of the ticket as set forth in the applicable regulations should be a requirement of the airlines and should the Agency accept American's position in the answer it will result in diminution of passenger standing, increase the likelihood passengers do not receive the benefits of the ticket they purchase, and entrench the power of the airlines that already hold substantial positions vis-a-vis passengers. Airline tickets are already contracts of adhesion, with little bargaining power for passengers besides the power to purchase or not, which then disappears following purchase with the airline being both interpreting and enforcing the contract for transport. Providing passengers with the details of their contract and purchased travels at least allows a passenger to exercise what little rights they have under the contract of carriage and in law/regulation. 

The agency should not accept American's position that mere confirmations are sufficient enough disclosure and that the agency along with the traveling public should ""trust them"" to do always do the right thing. Besides, there is minimal cost burden to airlines to provide the full details of the ticket, including fare basis, individual taxes collected and tariff calculations in detail. The airlines already have this information in their systems as they use it to calculate the initial fare, manage remittance of taxes and other fare components to other carriers or their own accounting systems. The only additional requirement is disclosing the same to the purchaser. 

In my situation, American refuses or claims to be unable to tell me what individual taxes they have collected from me and what may have been remitted, they have repeatedly told me on the phone that they are collecting United Kingdom passenger duty at a time when my itinerary did not meet the requirements for collecting such tax (I had a connection not a stopover), and they could not tell me why I kept having to pay additional surcharges with each change beyond change fees and applicable taxes that are readily calculated. As I was traveling I have had little to no choice to pay their demands unless i lose my ticket or have to find alternative travel means. This is mostly caused because American has determined that it is under no obligation to share the details of the contract made and the fare, taxes and surcharges made, and the Agency has so far failed to enforce its rules in this respect. I have written and called into many of American's departments, including their executives without success, and indeed some of the departments have indicated that they cannot get answers from their colleagues. How can a consumer then be able to assert their rights?

Finally, to preempt any claims of hardship or burden as American suggests in its response, I am attaching a copy of a receipt I received recently from Delta. Note the complete detail on taxes and fare basis calculation.

The Department of Transport should not support American's position and should enforce its long standing and valid rules, Airlines should be required to provide full details of the ticket information as contained in the airlines records, they already have to have this information to operate, and any refusal to so disclose is to the detriment of the public.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2015-0087-0060/attachment_1.png",

The argument of American Airlines that that this requirement (for a ticket) is outdated is specious.  The form in which the ticket is issued, with all the required information, can keep up with the times and be in electronic format.  This protects both the consumer and the airline, and keeps everything above board, particularly with relation to taxes.

14 CFR 399.83 should be retained and should be enforced.
Transparency in commerce, and particularly in e-commerce (which includes 'virtual' airline tickets) is key.
Without transparency, there cannot be real competition, and markets will necessarily become less competitive, less fair (unfair), more anti-consumer (deceptive), and ultimately less efficiency for the national economy (harmful).
All airline ticket purchases, no matter by what channel, must continue to generate a 'ticket' (which could be a classic Virtual Coupon Record, as long as it continues to retain the same full details as the old full paper tickets did), and these tickets must be provided in full to the purchaser by default - without the purchaser having to ask. Electrons are cheap. There is no excuse for not including the whole ticket record in the email (or other electronic) confirmation of every ticket purchase.

I urge DOT to uphold this complaint that AA has violated 14 CFR  399.83, and to impose sanctions commensurate with the consequent damages to consumers.

Phone calls to the booking agent were quite long as they were unable to confirm anything without reaching out to the airline directly.

They do not claim they provided Mr. Borsetti with a ticket per 14 CFR 399.83.  Their rebuttal focuses on Mr. Borsetti's request for a ""'complete copy of the electronic ticket record' as stored in the carrier's electronic reservations system."" 

I cannot comment on all what is stored in the carrier's electronic reservations system. But surely AA must provide passengers with what AA itself defines as a ticket in it's own published tariff, at least as of today:

""TICKET MEANS THE ""PASSENGER TICKET AND BAGGAGE CHECK,"" INCLUDING ALL FLIGHT, PASSENGER AND OTHER COUPONS THEREIN, ISSUED BY CARRIER, WHICH PROVIDE FOR THE CARRIAGE OF THE PASSENGER AND HIS BAGGAGE""

By its own tariff (see Rule 71 in its international tariff), AA uses fare and tax information on a per-flight-coupon basis to calculate such things as denied-boarding compensation. So this information, at a minimum, must be there in AA's records structured by coupon.

The GPS L1 C/A code signal used as the primary, and often sole, navigation and timing signal in most civil applications has numerous well known structural vulnerabilities that will not be stimulated under this test plan. Specifically, C/A codes are short and repeat themselves every 1 msec leading to a line spectrum vulnerability. Low level interference can cause sustained biases in measured pseudorange and carrier phase, often with no measurable change in observed C/No.

Interfering sources with structural components that are a multiple of 1 kHz or 1msec are of particular concern. LTE downlink signals have several structural components that fit this criterion:

1.	The underlying subcarrier symbol rate is 15 kHz
2.	Reference symbols have a 1 msec periodicity that can yield 1 kHz lines
3.	The RF frame length is 10 msec.
4.	LTE OFDM waveforms are not constant envelope. Periodicities in out of band interference can couple into a GPS receiver via AGC and nonlinear frontend effects.

The ABC draft test plan proposes using white noise as a stand-in for LTE signals. White noise is the most benign form of interference there is for a GPS L1 C/A code receiver. Waveforms 100 times weaker can cause larger errors in position and time and, without altering C/No. White noise has no periodicities and it is not capable of inducing measurement bias effects. 

Navigation and timing receivers have objectives that are fundamentally different from communications receivers. Testing for adjacent band compatibility should not rely solely on SNR / C/No depression, especially since C/No is often ill-defined in cases where waveform on waveform structural interaction dominates. Specific type compatibility testing is needed. If the objective is to measure adjacent band compatibility with LTE signals, you need to test with LTE signals. White noise is an inadequate and overly benign stand-in which can lead to overly permissive interference tolerance masks.

Infrastructure like the NDGPS should actually be expanded with emergency use in mind, not cancelled because handheld GPS devices are suddenly affordable by everyone. Another point would be that NDGPS sites should be hardened to tampering and supplied with backup power for the sake of aforementioned emergency use. A ""multilayered contingency plan"" would include a certain number of portable or heliostat-deployable NDGPS units for use when fixed ground units are disabled for reasons of natural disaster or terrorism.

Redundancy is key in natural disasters. My one concern especially in major metropolitan areas is the possibility for temporary and even permanent damage to antennas, hardware, software and infrastructure.

The Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) has accuracy that draws down positions from 45 feet to mere inches. When Mariners are making calculations in course corrections a 45 foot error in a starting point can lead to errors of miles at later waypoints. This can lead to near misses, collisions, fatalities and or bridge collisions.

In a natural disaster such as Earthquakes, Tsunamis and or Power grid failures this system (DGPS) and GPS networks can and will fail. The effort to repair and or rebuild is much more expensive and time consuming that simply shutting off the switch and turning off land point stations. If this is primarily a cost savings effort consider the cost of ship collisions causing transportation and environmental catastrophes. 

Vessels within inland waters are especially susceptible to groundings and or bridge collisions.

Please consider keeping in place sufficient network land stations DGPS and (backup stations) that can go back online in a moment's notice during station outages and failures.

What can happen will happen.

As a marine pilot, I see the reduction in this service counter to the demanding navigation challenges posed by operating some of the largest cruise ships afloat and cargo vessels with limited maneuverability (most often with electronic aids to navigation that are inferior to portable piloting aids carried aboard by the pilot) in these waterways.

Cruise ships are quickly moving to paperless chart rooms and navigation is reliant on electronic positioning.  Some cruise line companies are going as far as wanting to operate with track-keeping autopilots with system automation that reports deviations from an electronic track line to the home office.  Though I strongly oppose this method of navigation, the art of navigation is becoming more and more reliant on electronic navigation.

Reducing position accuracy in an area such as Southeast Alaska with narrow channels, inestimable number submerged hazards, waterways affected by extreme currents and dangerous winds, is counter to navigation safety.  The local Coast Guard has proposed reducing some of the fixed aids to navigation service which is further contradictory to the proposal to reduce dGPS.  Reducing aids to navigation service is the wrong direction to take.

For example, GPS disciplined clocks and oscillators are key components of critical infrastructure systems such as telecommunication networks and the electric power grid.  When they lose satellite reception, these GPS devices immediately go into ""holdover"" mode, and their performance is only as good as their local oscillator.

If the DGPS stations were re-purposed to perform a simple task, such as broadcasting a standard frequency signal, future GPS disciplined clocks and oscillators manufactured for use in the United States could be designed to receive that signal and switch over to the terrestrial radio signal to control the frequency of their local oscillators during a GPS outage. This would greatly improve their holdover capability, perhaps allowing them to maintain microsecond level time synchronization for multiple weeks in absence of GPS.

The redesign of the DGPS system would be straightforward, but it would probably be best to put all of the re-purposed transmitters on the same frequency, 300 kHz, for example.  GPS disciplined products would then simply receive the signal from the nearest station.  It would also be necessary, of course, to have cesium clocks or an equivalent reference at each of the sites.  Additional information (such as a time code) could be modulated on to the signal, but a standard carrier frequency would be sufficient for providing frequency holdover.

Note that a scheme similar to this was utilized by at least one telecommunications company with legacy LORAN-C, prior to that system being turned off in 2010, so some proof of concept already exists.

Currently the commentator's use of the NDGPS system is as a system of systems component in a FAA NextGen proof of concept (POC) vehicle UAS flight management system. 

The basic operational scenarios for this POC vehicle is to provide highly accurate, real-time position, ground speed, direction of flight, and course navigational data within a 'weight restricted avionics payload to UAS commercial system owners/operators.

This POC system uses the NDGPS system and  the Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) procedures to provide highly accurate flight data using a fixed ground station equipped with a multi-channel software defined radio system (SDR) and open source GPS correction and correlation software to produce a positional value to a cloud-based information processing system which can then be accessed by FAA flight control systems and operators as well as commercial aviation aircraft.

After further system development and testing, this POC UAS system and its use of the NDGPS system will have applications to commercial UAS operations nationally and will provide a cost-effective COTS platform to integrate UAS vehicles into the nation's airspaces without increasing the FAA flight operation workloads or aircraft management infrastructure (control and radar towers). 

Further, we envision the NDGPS could play a pivotal and vital role in the emergence of the IoT to provide cost-effective GPS services. Again, an operational scenario is the NDGPS provides high-precision location data that can be used to match a location to a destination USPS nine digit zip-code address  in the national Address Correction System. 

The advantages of this system to logistic services providers and carriers such as UPS, FedExp, USPS, and others can be easily understood when one understands the limited payload and fuel duration of flight characteristics of UAS vehicles.  In fact, the USPS could use a variant of the POC GPS system now to provide commercially valuable highly accurate real-time, 'in route' transit times and locations of time sensitive, packages, letters, and parcels.  


(2) The impact on NDGPS users if NDGPS were discontinued;

After a two year development effort, we were unable to duplicate a GPS system with the necessary payload requirements and position accuracy measurements within a reasonable cost. The key element is this POS system use of the NDGPS is the SDR base station's link to several GPS satellite transmissions and the NDGPS as described in the RTK. 

Without such a highly accurate source of ground position reference data, the < 3 meter position accuracy cannot be achieved without purchasing more accurate survey GPS equipment which is both too expensive and has a unacceptable weight and risk of loss penalty. Also, the loss of the NDGPS would delay the advancement of the inclusion of commercial UAS flight operations into the FAA NextGen ATCS.       


(3) If NDGPS were discontinued, the possible alternatives for meeting users' positioning, navigation, and timing requirements; and

We do not know of any technically feasible alternatives which would be available tot the general public at a acceptable commercial cost. 

(4) Potential alternative uses for the existing NDGPS infrastructure.

It's our opinion, the NDGPS could provide the USPS an infrastructure to offer very attractive parcel, letter, and package tracking services at a nominal cost of operation and infrastructure investment. The USPS could license or provide such services to commercial logistic providers such as FedEx, Amazon, UPS, and other shipping and container services (roadway, rail, and air) that are not otherwise available.

The first is the real-time use of the broadcast NDGPS corrections. The second is the use of these sites within the CORS network. I have never used the real-time broadcast corrections and there would be no impact to me if the broadcasts were terminated. However, I have used every single day of data ever recorded at many of the sites proposed for shutdown, and the loss of the GPS receivers as CORS sites would be significant. The fact that these sites comprise only 5% of the CORS network is misleading, because in some places (particularly in Alaska) their removal would result in a significant loss of CORS coverage over large geographical areas. My strong recommendation is that the DGPS broadcasts can be terminated, but the receivers themselves maintained as CORS sites. Remaining as CORS-only sites, the sites could be simplified considerably. Only the primary receiver would need to be retained, as the redundancy requirement for CORS is lower.

When considering the impact of the loss of sites as CORS sites, it is not sufficient to consider only the number of sites or their fraction of the CORS network. The distribution of sites and existence (or not) of alternate sites within a few tens of kilometers distance must be considered. The Alaska sites in particular do not have replacements, and removal would create gaps of as much as hundreds of kilometers (miles) in the available CORS network. The same is true of many of the remaining sites in the lower 48 and Hawaii, because other CORS site operators did not locate sites close to the NDGPS sites, to avoid duplication of effort.

The largest user group for these sites as CORS is the land survey and GIS community. The NDGPS sites in Alaska are a vital resource for this community. They often need to make short duration surveys (a few minutes to an hour or two) of survey points, with an accuracy requirement of 1-2 cm level for survey applications and the sub-meter level for GIS/mapping applications. Reliably achieving that accuracy requires a nearby CORS base station, where the proximity requirement for the CORS station depends on the application and duration of measurements but is typically several tens of kilometers or shorter. If there is no base station close enough, then the time on site required to get the same accuracy using remote CORS jumps dramatically, in some cases to several hours on site (in that case the proximity requirement is only a several hundred kilometers or closer). Removal of the six Alaska sites will create large holes in the CORS network that will force users working in those areas to incur significantly larger time on site and larger expense to carry out work that for years they have been able to do using these sites. This problem is magnified by the recent removal of 3 other long-running CORS sites in Alaska and the potential for loss of funding to the remainder, which are part of the Plate Boundary Observatory supported by the National Science Foundation. The Alaska sites are absolutely needed as CORS.

I use data from about half of the sites on the list for research purposes on a daily basis. I analyze every day of data to study crustal motions, and to monitor Earth deformation caused by tectonics, earthquakes, and volcanism. Other CORS sites were sited to complement the NDGPS sites without duplication, so the NDGPS locations are not easily replaced. I use the six NDGPS sites in Alaska that are proposed for shutdown (Biorka, Cape Hinchinbrook, Cold Bay, Gustavus, Kodiak, and Level Island), plus several in the Lower 48. Near-real-time and ultimately real-time monitoring systems are being developed using these data, aimed at enhanced earthquake and tsunami monitoring and early warning systems. Removal of these sites would be a significant blow for these efforts.

Particularly in Alaska, many users and applications depend on their continued existence. Their removal would cause a substantial loss of capability and significantly increased expenses for many land survey/GIS/mapping users. Their removal would cause significant data gaps for research users and would impede the development of enhanced volcanic, earthquake and tsunami monitoring and early warning systems. The retention of the sites as CORS sites would not require the degree of physical redundancy currently used for the NDGPS sites. A single receiver and antenna at each location would be sufficient, without the second redundant unit and separate integrity monitors, and without the need for the DGPS broadcasts. CORS real-time data streams can be simply and cost-effectively disseminated by internet. The cost of maintaining the sites as CORS only should be considered, as it is likely to be substantially lower than the present cost, and it may be possible to operate the sites as CORS sites for a considerable period of time for less than the cost of decommissioning and removing the sites.

We often work in remote areas and the loss of only a few stations, such as the Whitney and Medora stations, will leave us with large gaps for correction thus making our data much less accurate. This seems like a large step backwards for what is a fast growing use of GPS for all kinds of resource, emergency, and navigation purposes. If the issue is funds, why not partner with more agencies? If the belief is that these services are duplicating others that are out there, I think that is a false assumption.

Discussion: In observing and reporting a hazardous or potentially hazardous situation in a remote coastal area, (waterspout or flooding for example) the reporter will want to  be able to answer the question ""where is it?"". The operator, (whether a 911 call center, NOAA weather station, public utility company, etc.) will likely be in another county or even another state. There are distinct dangers associated with activating communication devices in or around many hazards during many circumstances, so the reporter will need to answer ""where was it?"" with some degree of precision, because reports should only be submitted from a safe place. The operator will then need to notify the response team with precision where the location is or was, hours or days later. In aquatic environments, due to wind, currents, tides, dispersion, dissipation or other movement, the next question is ""where will it be in an hour/day/week?"". Telephone call centers will usually ask for a specific road or street address. This is not possible on the water. Inland navigation with my handheld GPS has proven reliable with regard to latitude and longitude, but the elevation measurements ""above sea level"" vary (more than 100 feet on the same day at times) due to barometric pressure changes or fluctuations. The marine sextant, in combination with a GPS, or other tools can provide an accurate position if the proper sea level is known. In summary, in a coastal environment, if waterway users are to report floods, MARPOL violations, accidents, gas leaks, oil spills, waterspouts, power lines down, or other phenomenon, then an accurate way of answering the questions :where is it? where was it? and where is it headed? will enhance prevention, response and recovery of potentially hazardous situations.

For our agency and public customers, the utility of these stations as real-time DGPS is secondary to their use for post processing, development of geographic data and refinement of Geographic data models.  If the sites must be trimmed, I'd hope only the DGPS/radio beacon be decommissioned but leave the base station in place.  There is still some use of the DGPS signal because in many areas of operation, WASS and internet based correction signals are not available.  WASS is too low on the southern horizon and internet data service is quite limited.  I would hope some consideration be given to upgrading the receivers from GPS to GNSS capability.  In our agency, the USDA Forest Service, we are working to add new GNSS Base stations to serve National Forest System lands.  The need is great and we'd hate to see a reduction to the current system.  OPUS position solutions are invaluable for precise solutions for survey applications and mapping grade GIS.  However those OPUS solutions are heavily dependent on close proximity to existing CORS stations.  We need a higher density of CORS, rather than a reduced density.  

There are six maritime sites in the state of Alaska under consideration and four of those sites are on or in close proximity to national forest lands.  We have many business areas, including but are not limited to Heritage, Forest Management, Engineering, Minerals, Lands, GIS and others that will be impacted if the following Alaska sites are decommissioned:  

Biorka, Cape Hinchinbrook, Cold Bay, Gustavus, Kodiak, and Level Island. 
 
I urge you to support the continued operation of all the AK sites and especially the four on or near the national forest lands.  At the very least, I hope another agency or group such as UNAVCO to take these sites over.  Thank you for your consideration regarding this resource.

SEAPA is an association of Marine Pilots who frequently use the DGPS sites at Level Island, Biorka, and Gustavus, AK (which are slated for de-commissioning.)  Our Portable Pilot Units interface with foreign-flagged ship equipment, and we have no control over the GPS units used by these vessels.  Additionally, the World's commercial fleets (and the USCG) are rapidly embracing electronic charts, and de-emphasizing traditional means of terrestrial navigation and paper charts.  

Due to the navigational hazards in Alaska, extreme weather and sea conditions, occasional poor satellite coverage due to the fjords, and the extreme sensitivity to environmental issues here, we don't feel that any degradation of navigational accuracy is appropriate.  In these challenging conditions we move about a million passengers and hundreds of thousands of tons of cargo per year on ships that can exceed 1000 feet in length. 

Glacier Bay National Park and the Tongass National Forest are arguably the most environmentally sensitive maritime areas in North America and could be devastated by a navigation mishap.  Reducing the accuracy of the electronic navigation infrastructure in these areas is counter to the goals of protecting our pristine waters.

We strongly urge you to keep our DGPS sites operational.

SUBJECT:  Review of Federal Register Notice:   Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS) - Docket number DOT-OST-2015-0105.

1. Reference Federal Register Notice dated 08/18/2015, subject as above, from the Coast Guard, Transportation Department, and the Engineers Corps.

2. Operations Office has the following comments/concerns regarding the Federal Register Notice in regards to decommissioning the proposed 62 locations across the United States.

a.	The decommissioning of NDGPS sites in the upper Great Lakes will have a major impact on hydrographic surveying in the Detroit District, Corps of Engineers. The Detroit District has numerous in-house and contractor hydrographic survey vessels operating out of offices in Duluth, MN, Kewaunee, WI, Sault Ste. Marie, MI Grand Haven, MI Traverse City, MI and Detroit, MI that currently use the NDGPS system for most basic hydrographic surveying operations. These survey operations are critical to support channel and harbor maintenance and dredging throughout the upper Great Lakes, including the connecting channels and numerous deep draft commercial harbors. Although some of these survey vessels have the capability to use RTK or cell phone corrections many do not. We also have many areas where cell phone coverage is weak or non-existent and setting up RTK base stations is problematic. At this time the six sites listed below for shut down are critical to our hydrographic surveying operations:   

Wisconsin Point, WI
Upper Keweenaw, MI
Sturgeon Bay, WI
Mequon, MI
Cheboygan, MI
Saginaw Bay, MI

b.	We strongly urge that this decision to close these sites be reconsidered or as a minimum postponed for two years to allow us time to obtain additional equipment and adjust our field operations. We also support leaving Pickford and Detroit fully operational as planned as they are also critical to our surveying operations.

c.	In addition to the District impacts listed above, we've had discussions with the commercial shipping industry, and they've expressed major concerns with the decommissioning plan. They plan to submit their own comments to the public notice. However, it should be noted that the Great Lakes Navigation System supports over 226,000 jobs and brings in a total of $33.5 billion in business revenue. Most of the iron ore shipped through the system originates in Lake Superior ports with over 53,800,000 tons of iron ore shipped in 2013. In addition, Saginaw is a major receiving port that ships/receives over 2.5 million tons a year. Abandoning the five sites listed above would have significant impacts and should be reconsidered.

3. If there are any questions please contact Derek Cusimano (313)226-3776 or Donald Holly (313)226-6816 in the  Technical Services Branch at 6-3776.

In response to the CORS Stations being discontinued. We have surveyed or assisted on the inland river  waterways system that covers most of the Eastern have of the country. The topograghy is different within every river system which means there is not many locations for a base station or RTK. We rely on DGPS for the most accurate position we can get out on the river systems. With out this accuracy the hydro surveys that aid in commercial navigation's electronic navigation charting and updated shoaling conditions from the hydro surveys, commercial tows could end up with incorrect depth's resulting in major accidents within our inland rivers and waterways. Not having the DGPS could be the difference in having safe navigation or ripping a hole in the bottom of a coal or asphalt barge and sinking.

AKDOT & PF Southcoast Region extends from the Dixon Entrance south of Ketchikan westerly along the coast of the Gulf of Alaska to Attu Island at end of the Aleutian chain. My group is responsible for the surveying and mapping of the State's transportation infrastructure to include airports, marine highway facilities, and roadways amongst other State interests. The 6 listed Alaskan NDGPS stations contain 6 GPS Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) whose precise positions are maintained and published by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS). DOT uses the continuously received and published CORS GPS receiver data for post processing of locally collected survey grade positional GPS data so that we may reference our survey and mapping projects to the latest realization of the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS) as defined by NGS. The CORS network represents our only active tie to said reference system. This tie and reference is statutory as well as the spatial foundation of all of our projects. Our projects can be for establishment of geodetic control networks, aerial or bathymetric mapping, modelling of existing terrain and infrastructure, land boundary and rights-of-way determination, and tidal levels to name several.

DOT surveyors do not use the navigational correction broadcast supplied by the NDGPS site. However the loss of the entire NDGPS to include its CORS will leave gaps in the CORS network along the south coast of Alaska. This will cause extra time and expense for each project where these gaps exist. The rest of the CORS we count on are the National Science Foundations' Plate Boundary Observatory CORS. It is my understanding some of these are in jeopardy due to funding issues down the road. This will be disastrous to our spatial infrastructure in Alaska. We have difficulty relying on passive physical monuments set in the ground however robustly they may be constructed. The coastal areas of Alaska have too much crustal motion from frost heave, unsuitable soils, and glacial rebound.

In summary if the federal government finds it necessary to decommission the 6 listed Alaskan NDGPS stations then consideration should be given to keeping the CORS portion of the system operating as usual. This will save funding by eliminating the correction broadcast but keep the important link to the NSRS intact.",,,,,,,

and consider the USCG DGPS sites to be an essential part of the CORS network in southeast 
Alaska. At PNW we do not utilize the NDGPS broadcast signal, mainly because the GPS equipment we are 
currently using is not equipped to receive the signals. However, we are considering new equipment and 
we do have a very occasional need to navigate to precise locations in the field where having access to 
NDGPS real-time corrections would be useful.  Our primary use of the DGPS stations is for differentially 
correcting GPS data collected in the field. We and our cooperators depend on accurate positioning data 
for use in a variety of research projects (e.g., studying ecosystem processes, building landscape models, 
forest monitoring, inventories, and assessments, etc).

The panhandle of southeast Alaska (SEAK) covers an area roughly the size of Pennsylvania and has 12 
CORS stations available: 7 operated by UNAVCO, 4 by the USCG, and 1 by the FAA. Not a single site is 
equipped with a GNSS receiver. In comparison, Pennsylvania has at least 40 CORS stations, over half of 
which are GNSS-capable, and many more stations available near the borders of surrounding states.  
Decommissioning 3 of the 4 USCG NDGPS sites in SEAK (GUS5, BIS6, LEV6) would reduce the already 
sparse CORS network by 33%. If GUS5, BIS6 and LEV6 are decommissioned, and funding for the UNAVCO 
PBO base stations is not renewed in 2018, then SEAK will have only 2 CORS stations: one USCG DGPS 
(AIS6) station at the very south end of the area, and an FAA station towards the north in Juneau, a 
distance of over 400km.  If the 6 Alaska DGPS stations are decommissioned and the PBO network is not 
funded, there will be enormous CORS gaps throughout Alaska. 

I strongly advocate for keeping the Alaska USCG GPS stations operating as base stations on the CORS 
network even if the broadcast signal is eliminated. They are needed for redundancy and maintaining an 
adequate CORS network for differential correction. Furthermore, I would support replacing the Alaska 
USCG GPS sites with GNSS receivers. There may be opportunities to partner with the USFS in this regard.
The ability to collect GLONASS positions has significantly improved data collection in southeast Alaska where 
the GPS constellation is sparse, terrain is steep, and forest canopy is dense; however, the closest GNSS 
station on the CORS network available for differential correction is in Atlin, British Columbia.

I am writing in opposition to the premature proposed decommissioning of the dGPS sites at Biorka, Gustavus, and Level Island. This is 3 out of 4 presently available regional sites.  The proposal asserts to be leave dGPS in place where precise navigation is required - this will NOT be the case in our region - it will severely degrade the system's precision.  

The proposed action compromises the safety of millions of passengers, and millions of dollars of sea borne commerce - unless there is an equally precise, and equally accessible proven technology currently available to marine users

Glacier Bay National Park, Tracy Arm/Fords Terror Wilderness, and the Admiralty Island National Monument are among the most environmentally sensitive waters of our nation.  They are best protected by ensuring that maritime commerce passing thru or near them have the best navigational signal possible available.

If CORS/WAAS is redundant to the coverage from these dGPS sites - please publish the studies that prove the efficacy of said technology for surface users.  My research only revealed coverage charts for aviation users.  Have local trials been conducted to prove that the surface WAAS signal has not been degraded by our labyrinthine mountainous topography - as was experienced with Loran-C, GPS, and dGPS ? Lastly, are all shipboard GPS receivers able to utilize the CORS/WAAS signal? This should be ascertained before rushing to eliminate the proven dGPS system. 

As Pilots, we rely upon terrestrial navigation techniques; electronic navigation is a back-up, cross check method.  However, there are numerous areas in which we pilot where precise terrestrial navigation is not timely to allow large vessels to safely pass - the Tracy Arm Bar, Sitkaladik Narrows in Glacier Bay, Wrangell Narrows, and Hawk Inlet and we are forced to integrate ""eNav"" into our methodologies. Precision is vital.  We are hampered by the risk of severe weather and lack of visibility throughout the year. In addition, the local Coast Guard has proposed reducing some of the fixed aids to navigation in favor of ""eNav"" - this is directly contradictory to this proposal to reduce dGPS.  I agree with another commenter - ""reducing aids to navigation is the wrong direction to take.""

Please delay this proposed action until CORS/WAAS is proven equal or better to dGPS for surface users.

The surveys are used to layout dredge cuts and shared with the Coast Guard cutters for buoy placement.  We do not have any commercial services in the KY area that will cover our area of concern.  The WAAS is not a survey grade system that we can rely on for any certainty of accuracy.   

It appears there is not much use for differential as it is hard to find beacon radio modems and antennas.  The reason, it is so popular the Differential correction beacon is built into all survey grade systems as a standard product.  If you shut the towers down without us having an alternative, it will greatly degrade the accuracies of the base mapping and buoy placement supporting commercial navigation.  Being off 5 meters in a narrow winding river bar area will ground a towboat.  The surveys and buoy placement accuracy is critical.

I am writing to say that I am against the removal of DGPS stations especially the Hudson Falls, NY location.  The following reasons are why:

DGPS stations provide reliable terrestrial correction signal of the GPS signal.

The upper part of the Hudson River, including Albany is in a single coverage area, this coverage is provided by the Hudson Falls station.

Radio beacon DGPS correction is optimized for surface navigation, WAAS is intended for air navigation.

Redundant DGPS signals are important because a signal can be lost during maintenance of a station and in thunderstorms

As a New York State Licensed Pilot I am mandated to carry portable navigation computers that rely on the Hudson Falls DGPS signal.

I ask that these reasons be heavily considered and that the DGPS stations not be removed.  Hudson Falls DGPS station is not only used by State Licenses Pilots, it is also used by enrolled Tug and Barges transiting to and from the Port of Albany.  An accurate signal which is located near the port is very crucial and if the Hudson Falls location was removed the nearest station would be approximately 150 miles away.

Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System

The Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation is dedicated to reinforcing and protecting our nation's essential Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) services. PNT services are essential for virtually every technology. We must have multiple and robust sources of PNT so that a disruption to one will not threaten our nation's security and economy.

We understand and do not object to the administration's determination that the Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS) is sufficiently like the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in its phenomenology and services provided such that it does not provide significant incremental benefit to the nation's PNT architecture as a whole. We do not object to termination of the signals from the 62 sites.

However, we note that the nation's current PNT architecture, including NDGPS and WAAS, is almost entirely dependent upon the Global Positioning System (GPS). In fact, GPS has been identified by senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security as ""...a single point of failure for critical infrastructure."" 

Having a single, vulnerable source of primary PNT is a far cry from the multi-layered, multi-phenomenology architecture called for in the inter-department National PNT Architecture Study Final Report published in September of 2008. 

Some or all of the 62 NDGPS sites (and associated equipment) could play an important role in achieving the PNT architecture America needs.  Disposing of them before we are assured they are not useful in completing that architecture is against the national interest and would not be the best use of government assets and funds.

The RNT Foundation objects to decommissioning the sites and disposal of any real or personal property as proposed in the announcement until the administration decides upon and implements a resilient PNT architecture that supports national security and economic vitality.

My name is Captain Scott Ireland. I am the Senior River Pilot with the Hudson River Pilots Association. Myself and other professional mariners working on the Hudson River are charged with safely and efficiently moving commercial vessels of all sizes, with any cargo, on the Hudson River to ports as far north as Albany NY

I'm writing to register my dismay and strong opposition to the proposal to decommission the Hudson Falls DGPS site. 

By New York State regulation, pilots are required to carry on board and utilize a satellite based navigation system. The Hudson Falls radio beacon DPGS correction is an invaluable tool that allows us to accurately pinpoint our vessels position in a river that has an unusually long and narrow shipping channel ( 50 miles long  x 400ft wide ) from Kingston NY to Albany. 

Through this narrow channel, along with a myriad of other cargoes, ships and barges carry millions of barrels of diesel fuel oil and more millions of barrels of Bakken Crude Oil. The DGPS signal correction from Hudson Falls is a crucial tool in ensuring that the safe transport of cargo....including hazardous cargo.... is done in a manner that both protects the environment and safely keeps commerce flowing.

The idea that the only DGPS station available in the upper Hudson Valley, an area of single station coverage, is being considered for decommission is, in my humble opinion, an action of navigational malpractice and is exceedingly ill considered.

I most strongly urge that the DOT withdraw any such plan to decommission the Hudson Falls DGPS site.

The USGS is the lead federal agency responsible for providing assessments and warnings for volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and landslides.  In support of that mission, the USGS processes data from various GPS networks, including some NDGPS sites.  We have assessed the potential impact of the decommissioning of 62 NDGPS stations and find that loss of the following stations would negatively impact USGS capabilities:

1.  In Alaska, the USGS is concerned about the potential loss of the Cold Bay NDGPS site, which would have a significant impact on monitoring volcanoes in the Aleutian island chain.  The Cold Bay site is used by the USGS Alaska Volcano Observatory as an off-volcano reference station for Unimak Island volcanoes (especially Shishaldin, one of the most active Aleutian volcanoes), enabling a clearer picture of the volcanic signal, which is especially important during a crisis.  Another site on the list to be decommissioned is Kenai/Nisiki, which was used for volcano monitoring until 2008, when its signal became too noisy due to an equipment change and was no longer of use.

2.  In California, the USGS is concerned about the potential loss of the Pigeon Point NDGPS site, which would negatively impact the USGS's ability to monitor earthquakes on the San Gregorio fault zone, since it is one of the few sites to the west of this fault.  The San Gregorio fault is located west of the San Andreas fault in northern California.  GPS data provide important information about the amount of motion accommodated on this fault, however because it is located largely offshore opportunities to collect such measurements are limited.  Paleoseismic evidence for earthquake offsets of 3 - >5 meters suggest that this fault is capable of producing earthquakes of magnitude 7 - 7.5.  A magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the San Gregorio fault between San Francisco and Monterey would produce very strong to severe shaking with moderate to heavy damage in San Francisco, the Peninsula, and coastal communities.

In support of its water mission, the USGS post-processes survey-grade GPS solutions using continually operating reference stations (CORS), partially composed of NDGPS sites, to establish datum among the cooperative streamgage network composed of nearly 8,000 gaging platforms.  These solutions are also used to inter-relate altitude among parts of the cooperative groundwater well network along with a significantly growing Short-Term network of storm-surge and event-based gage platforms.  Survey-grade GPS post-processed solutions are also used for a variety of interpretive investigations such as surface water modeling efforts and inundation mapping.  Effective flood-warnings and forecasts by the National Weather Service, flood-inundation maps of the USGS, all of which are derived from USGS streamgages, are all expressed in terms of elevations and the loss of precession and accuracy from these downgrades could have consequences on these services.

Longer-term (2+ hours) observations using the National Geodetic Survey's Online Position Users Service - Static (OPUS-S) required for post-processed solutions would still be permissible given the 62 NDGPS reduction; however, more expedient GPS work involving short-term observations (15 minute) using the National Geodetic Survey's - Online Position Users Service - Rapid Static (OPUS-RS) would have some degree of impact and solution degradation due to the 62 NDGPS reduction.  In terms of OPUS-RS, figure 1 identifies areas of solution degradation (0.5 - 1.0 cm.) in some parts of the U.S.; areas in black would lose the ability completely to provide these short-term observations for processing. Areas in Puerto Rico, islands of Oahu and Kauai, western Nevada, parts of Montana, and northwest Mississippi would likely be most impacted when attempting to conduct short-term GPS observations for post-processing.

The US Army Corps of Engineers, St. Paul District maintains 22 navigation projects throughout Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa.  These projects include the Upper Mississippi River, Minnesota River, and several commercial and recreational harbors to name a few.  The District depends on the Alma DGPS tower for hydrographic survey and dredging operations.  The following units would be impacted: Survey Launch 21, Survey Launch 22, Portable Survey Systems, Dredge Goetz, Dredge Dubuque, Government Mechanical Dredge Plant, two Contract Mechanical Dredge Plants, plus any contractor working on placement site unloading contracts and Upper Mississippi River Restoration projects.  Shutting down the Alma tower without having an alternative will greatly degrade accuracies of the survey mapping and buoy placement supporting commercial navigation.  Accuracy is critical due narrow and winding river conditions.  Channel shoaling and underwater navigation control structures like wing dams need to be accurately marked.

Currently there are no reliable alternatives that would keep all users as productive as utilizing the Alma tower.  Alternatives would have a large upfront financial impact and would need to be tested to ensure that all survey areas within the district have corrected GPS accessibility.  We have many areas where cell phone coverage is weak or non-existent and setting up RTK base stations would be problematic.  Other alternatives would have a major negative impact to production and could jeopardize the 9 foot navigation channel mission.  

We strongly recommend reconsidering the decision to close the Alma tower site or at a minimum postpone closure for two years to allow us time to obtain additional equipment and adjust field operations.

Decommissioning of these sites will seriously degrade the accuracy of positioning data available to marine traffic in the region thus also diminishing the safety of navigation.  

Although, in theory, there is duplicate coverage in WAAS/CORS this is unproven, and not approved by IMO, or APA.  The Southeast Alaska region is home to natural resource treasures that would suffer immeasurable damage from a marine incident.  DGPS is a reliable, proven resource of position data available to the myriad of users in a region of challenging weather conditions, and narrow fjords surrounded by high mountains whose bases frame the waterways.  WAAS signals are known to suffer from the shadow effect of high peaks, and coverage for surface (marine) users is unproven.

The trend in marine navigation, with the advances in technology and use of electronic chart systems,  is to stray ever farther from visual means of navigation.  Some of the larger cruise ships sailing the waters of the world visit Southeast Alaska waters and the push by industry is to navigate these vessels on a track-keeping autopilot linked to the DGPS.  As a pilot I oppose this means of navigation and pilot with visual means as a primary resource, but also carry a PPU as a secondary means of verification.  This portable pilot unit (ECS) obtains position, heading, course, speed, AIS data from the vessel (and also has an internal DGPS) providing a refined check on ship displays (ECDIS).  The vessel GPS units (as well as other electronics) are foreign-flag state chosen, and not under the control of the pilot.  It is unknown what percentage of these vessels can even utilize WAAS data.  Additionally the thousands of users of DGPS data, from recreational craft, commercial fishing, commercial cargo, and passengers vessels will operate on degraded GPS data.  It can not be expected that all of these users will be able to upgrade to WAAS capable units by January 2016, even if proven a reliable substitute for DGPS.

Again, I strongly urge you keep the Southeast Alaska DGPS sites operational.

These CORS sites are providing the only long-term measurement of potential displacements in eastern North America. Such a data set is all we have to potentially quantify a signal that we have speculated about for decades: a tectonic loading signal. What makes this network important is its density of coverage. The network is turning out to be of fundamental importance for earthquake hazards estimates within eastern U.S.. The western U.S. has a large number of stations that were put into place to measure rapid tectonic strains. On the east coast, deformation is much slower. Measuring potential intraplate strains has proven very difficult because rates are very low. Because the coverage is dense, and the time period covered relatively long, it is possible to begin to measure this signal. Directly measuring a signal of internal intraplate strains is something never before achieved for an intraplate region. Given the importance for earthquake hazards estimates and the impact on planning for infrastracture,  nuclear facilities, etc., I would consider this network of primary national importance. Given the population density in the central and eastern U.S., this network is of high value to taxpayers. 

Secondly, we are now looking at this network of displacements during and following major storms. We have observed a large signal following Hurricane Sandy that may represent a new observation of solid Earth deformation in response to storm surge loading. We are currently writing this result up for publication. It is impossible to determine what signal or signals might be detected next with this network, but its coverage and placement as part of a national infrastructure is of critical importance.",,,,,,,

At the US Geological Survey we are using data from these sites to monitor land subsidence in the Hampton Roads region and elsewhere.  The loss of the NDGPS site in Driver, VA (CORS site DRV6) would be particularly harmful to our efforts to determine rates of land subsidence in Hampton Roads.

These long-term sites are particularly valuable because they provide uninterrupted description of vertical land motion.  The longer a site has been operating the more valuable it is.  The DRV6 site and others like it on the proposed list have been in operation longer that most other sites on the CORS network.

Please do not cease operation of these sites.

Loss of these towers without having a reliable alternative will severely reduce accuracy of hydrographic surveys and dredging operations, increasing potential for marine casualties related to shoaling or other channel obstructions. 

Currently there are no alternatives to these towers that provide both the required accuracy and coverage area needed for our operations on the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers.  Alternatives such as subscription services that require internet access and/or cell coverage cannot be relied upon due to loss of signal in remote areas, and WAAS has not been demonstrated to provide sufficient accuracy.

It is the continuous time series of daily positions spanning many years that make this and other CORS stations particularly valuable. 

Continuous GPS data are also used for rapid characterization of earthquake ruptures following major events, which informs community earthquake response efforts. Finally, GPS from continuously operating GPS stations is playing an integral role in the earthquake early warning (EEW) systems developed for the western United States. We hope that solutions can be developed that will ensure the continuation of these important stations.

Alaska has more coastline than the rest of the US combined, and relatively few CORS for its size. As there is relatively poor alternative control in Alaska, and our datums are completely dependent on GNSS positioning, we separately need more CORS, not fewer. Current estimates suggest as many as 100 more CORS are important to provide infrastructure support.

As far as the CORS themselves are concerned, their operation is relatively cheap, compared to their original establishment and the benefits that derive from having them in the CORS network. Before these sites are decommissioned, alternatives should be sought for operational support. Other agencies may be able to assist, as can private companies who use the services that CORS provide. Removal of the NDGPS service will significantly reduce costs, and as the CORS can send data direct to NGS, the main cost is the data connection and the power, both of which are small, and can usually be included in the cost of a small office without being noticed. So another party could easily take over the CORS operation as CORS without incurring significant cost.

I note that one of the CORS has already had a major technical failure and been switched off (Cape Hinchenbrook, CHI6), and some of the Coast Guard sites actually have two CORS. While it often seems that there are plenty of CORS available, many of the UNAVCO-PBO sites are not as reliable as we might like, as they were not necessarily established with a view to continuous data collection and uploading to the CORS system at NGS.

In summary, CORS are as critical a piece of infrastructure for a modern nation as roads, rail lines and power networks. It is unfortunate that they are designed to be unobtrusive, and the infrastructure to which they provide immediate support is not always obvious. However, that does not mean that this infrastructure is any less critical to the nation than roads. In Alaska, with a dearth of roads and high reliance on sea and air for transportation and the movement of goods, a high-reliability CORS network is critical to safe travel and continued development of the region.

As a working surveyor for the past 40 years across three continents, as well as having been heavily involved in infrastructure development and implementation, I know how critically important this infrastructure is, and what are the consequences of allowing it to run down. I therefore strongly urge you to reconsider decommissioning these CORS sites, looking at alternative means of keeping them operational, as a means of aiding the common good of Alaska and the nation.",,,,,,,

For both of these applications, the rate of motion of the ground is small (millimeters per year), and accurate measurements require a long time series. Thus, the most valuable asset in these types of earth-monitoring applications is a long-running GPS station.

Although I do not directly use the broadcast DGPS service, the archived data collected by these 62 long-running stations is critical to my research. If these sites are decommissioned, the continuity of the timeseries will be lost, and my research will be severely impacted in a way that cannot easily be repaired by establishing new sites. 

If budget constraints require a cutback of some kind, may I suggest that the real-time DGPS aspect of these sites could be curtailed while retaining the operability and archival of the GPS data. This would allow scientific use of the data to continue, and ensure these stations continue to become even more valuable to the scientific community.",,,,,,,

I was on hand to cover the construction of the NDGPS towers, its purpose in providing an unbroken network of signals for what turned out to be sub-meter, real time kinematic (RTK) accuracy, and the evolution of GPS receivers. With the presence of this system, dredging and hydro survey vessels evolved to automate all functions. On dredges, the kinematic updates allowed x, y, z data on river and tidal stage and position of the cutting tool; estimating amounts already excavated and still to be excavated, and precise vessel location both for navigation and digging location -- all integrated by proprietary and purchased software to produce reports of unprecedented accuracy. Hydrographic survey boats using the system are also able to use the system in RTK mode for navigation, depths and sediment volumes for unprecedented accuracy in survey charts. 

A system that has had such an important effect on technology advancement, and which has provided sub-meter accuracy for so many for two decades cannot be judged to be ""not used by anyone"" with as little research as was done prior to making this decisison. 

Many users have progressed to other modes of position correction, but in conversations with people in the industry, I am finding that even those who are not using the NDGPS system as a primary source of position corrections believe that the system provides a necessary layer of redundancy in what could be life-threatening situations should another system fail, even briefly. I hope that for safety's sake and for the sake of the many making comments on this site who are using the system as a primary source of positioning, the agencies will see that shutting the system down would be a waste, if not a disaster for many users.

We still have and use GPS equipment that will receive the NDGPS signal.

Of additional concern is the possibility of losing the CORS stations that are currently providing data for the NDGPS broadcast.

I am commenting on behalf of the Columbia River Towboat Association, representing the multiple tug and barge lines that operate on the Columbia Snake River system.  We account for approximately 1400 to 1500 commercial barge tows transiting from the deep draft lower Columbia River Ports of Longview, Kalama, Vancouver and Portland, destined to the 28 upriver ports as far away as Lewiston Idaho, 365 miles east thru 8 Navlocks.  Our members strongly support the continuation of the DGPS system of enhanced accuracy for just that: enhanced accuracy in navigation. As the Columbia transitions into the narrow twisting Snake River canyons, bridge transits, shallow channels, and general navigation are dependent on the tightest of margins for safety and reliability. In particular, the Spokane and Appleton stations in WA, and Seneca in OR are of significant value to the system, as they provide the safety net of system coverage for our area of operation.  We well understand that with advances in satellite navigational technology, some earlier systems become obsolete, such as Loran.  But in this case, the extra margin of accuracy, placing a vessel and tow accurate to within 1 to 2 meters, rather than the 12 to 15 that un-enhanced GPS can sometimes give, is critical.  We strongly urge you to maintain these stations in order to continue to ensure the significantly enhanced margin of safety and accuracy they now provide.  we will be glad to revisit this proposal in the future as further gains in GPS accuracy are made.
best regards, Rob Rich, CRTA President.",,,,,,,

By that I mean terminating the real-time differential service and removing the secondary GNSS antenna and receiver.  The primary antenna and receiver should remain in place as an existing part of the NGS CORS network.  In that capacity they should continue to log GNSS data without interruption, and the data should continue to be publicly accessible through the NGS CORS website.

I believe all the sites proposed for decommission have existed for many years.  In fact, some of the oldest NGS CORS are NDGPS stations.  As such they represent valuable continuous monitoring sites valuable for scientific, engineering, and positioning applications.  I have personally made heavy use of one of the sites (Flagstaff) since it was installed in 2000.

Most of the sites at risk also form the foundation of the national network of geodetic control stations.  These stations were held as constraints in the 2007 and 2011 national adjustments.  Continuity of use helps maintain network integrity.

In addition, in some areas (such as Alaska), the NDGPS CORS are the only CORS available for very large geographic regions.  Their removal would significantly compromise the existing CORS network in those areas, and thus negatively impact users of those CORS.  Moreover, much of Alaska is tectonically active, and removal of such CORS would be a major data loss in what is already sparse coverage.  A similar thing can be for the tectonically active areas of the western coterminous US.

In summary, I am hopeful those responsible for deciding the fate of these sites will consider leaving the existing primary antenna and receiver in place.  These represent a substantial investment in existing spatial infrastructure, and the replacement costs would be far greater than the costs of continued operation.  So I believe the savings gained by entirely decommissioning the sites is false economy.",,,,,,,

I am reaching out to your company today to let you know the importance of your satellite signal, and what it means to my husbands company. We have been blessed to have this capability to better increased exact pinpoints and productivity with our machines for our customers.
I'm sure your company did quality research on the importance of what the satellite signal means to each state.
My question is who was part of the survey? Was it land surveyors? If the answer is yes, then you should know 
that all land surveyors don't know the importance of this. These companies contract us (mulching businesses) to cut precise lines with the comfort of knowing our work will be accurate. However, they don't always know how that 
is done. 
What you should know is fifty percent of his business is because of the signal you send. Yes, I did mention land surveyors is a part of that, but it also includes government contracts. Having this taking down will be detrimental in meeting the needs of these establishments.
His company is located in eastern North Carolina. As I look over the map of states that will be affected, I'm confused of why NC would be cut out completely. NC is close to several military bases and still is overwhelmed  by the growing population. As you know, the growth of any state will need lines cut and clearing done to help sustain influx of the growing population.

 

I will appreciate your consideration in leaving at least one operational site in our state.  The great state of NC.

I consider myself diligent in staying informed of what's going on within our industry.  After seeing an initial reference to the 
proposed DGPS shutdown issue in an on-line news article in early October, I made a number of calls to customers and 
colleagues to see what they knew about the issue.  To a person, no one knew of the proposed shut down.  Concerned by this
seeming lack of knowledge regarding the proposed shutdown, throughout what I see as a fairly large user base, I formed an 
informal ""round table"" group in an effort to identify concerns of our customer / NDGPS user base as a whole. 

I got together a small group of colleagues, each at the apex of their positions within their given industry or discipline.  These 
persons represent marine contractors and dredgers, GPS hardware manufacturers, ship's captain and harbor pilot associations
as well as the US Army Corps of Engineers and are fairly representative of our customer base.  As a whole, this group uses
100's of DGPS receivers on a daily basis, relying on USCG supplied corrections for their navigation and positioning needs.

Our discussions and findings are summarized below:

-	The DGPS user base relies on the accuracy and dependability delivered by the NDGPS network but does not frequent 
the listings within the Federal Register and hence does not know of the proposed shut down.

-	The NDGPS network performs so well, it's taken for granted by its users.  This adds to the overall problem of what
would be experienced if the system were shut down in a ""turn-key"" fashion in January, 2016.

-	The fallout from a turnkey shutdown of 62 stations in January, 2016 is incalculable at this point and should be studied
 further prior to any such broad-based decommissioning of the system.

-	There seems to be quite a bit of ""misinformation"" amongst the small group of proponents that our group contacted that 
needs to be addressed, to include a number of technical issues and the true size of the user base itself. 

-	The NDGPS network is a key component of our nation's infrastructure that needs to remain largely intact.  This includes
both the DGPS broadcasts and the Continuous Operating Reference Stations (CORS) stations within each site that form the 
national Geospatial network for NOAA-NGS. 

My personal opinion, as a tax payer and small business owner,  is that the NDGPS network is truly a national resource and a 
key component to our nation's infrastructure.  You don't need to look far or long to find reference to the deterioration of our 
country's infrastructure and its effect on our status of leadership as a nation and a driver of our nation's economic engine.  Our
inland waterways are a key to the President's stated goal of increasing exports.  The NDGPS network plays a key role in 
servicing these same waterways.  To intentionally degrade this network can only have a negative impact on our nation as a 
whole.

Based on the feedback and responses of our small round table group, (representative of only the customer base I have a 
working relationship with and not including other groups such as GIS practitioners, agricultural users, First Responders, etc.,)
I respectfully request that this issue receive further and more complete due diligence prior to any ""turn-key"" shut down of the
system.",,,,,,,

GPS located near to tide gauges provide critical control on their stability and vertical land movement. Several of the sites proposed for decommissioning are near to important tide gauges used for climate related work - both in terms of long-term (multi-decadal) sea level measurements and in terms of validation of satellite altimeter missions such as the NASA Topex/Jason series. King (2014) reported to the UN Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) program detailing areas of need for new GPS/GNSS deployments, highlighting the need for expansion of such networks. I urge the US Coast Guard to not decommission a site where no alternative continuous GPS/GNSS site is available, at least of similar quality, and equally close proximity to a tide gauge. Before any decommissioning I encourage the Coast Guard to seek advice from the NASA JPL Ocean Surface Topography Mission/Jason Science Team, GLOSS and the International GNSS Service TIGA program .

Specifically, the recommendation to decommission the dGPS sites at Gustavus, Alaska; Biorka, Alaska and Level Island, Alaska is detrimental for the following reasons. 
The dGPS site at Gustavus, Alaska supports the safe navigation of Hawk Inlet Alaska.  The local USCG COTP has stated that a vessel grounding in Hawk Inlet would be devastating to the surrounding environment and severely restrict mining operations.  Recently, the USCG COTP reduced the underkeel clearance requirements in this waterway with rational that included the constant risk assessment by the Southeast Alaska Pilots and the improved navigation capabilities (including electronic navigation systems) for this waterway.  The Pilots are not on record endorsing this decision and eliminating dGPS coverage for this waterway is not consistent with local USCG rationale (for reducing the underkeel clearance).
The dGPS site at Level Island Alaska supports the safe navigation of ships within Wrangell Narrows.  Transits of this waterway by larger cruise ships are increasing, resulting in reduced navigation tolerances and increased emphasis on electronic navigation systems.  
The dGPS site at Biorka, Alaska supports safe navigation into Sitka and Peril Straits.  Cruise ship transits are expanding into previously unused waterways in this area and again, result in increased reliance on accurate and reliable electronic navigation systems. 
The USCG has encouraged industry partnerships that include investment by Pilots in Pilot Portable Units (PPU's) that are dependent on the navigation infrastructure (which includes dGPS). Degrading the accuracy and reliability of the electronic navigation infrastructure as proposed is a step in the wrong direction and is not recommended.

Alternatives include deployment of a local GPS base station and SBAS. However, setting up a local base station can have substantial cost associated with it, and SBAS is frequently unavailable due to terrain.

	The majority of Alaska's coastline is not covered by DGPS. In areas without coverage we frequently need to install GPS base stations on shore, which can drive up the cost for our clients considerably. The proposed reduction in DGPS coverage would greatly decrease the area of coverage and increase costs of providing hydrographic services in those areas for our client, the US government.

	Our clients seeking hydrographic surveys frequently have limited budgets available. The increased costs associated with installation of GPS base stations to support hydrographic projects in areas without DGPS coverage will inevitably result in reconsideration of marginal projects and elimination of future projects, and reduce associated economic activity.

	TerraSond has found that SBAS is often not an option for hydrographic surveys in Alaska. SBAS satellites are low on the southern horizon and are easily masked by terrain. USCG DGPS signals, at approximately 300 kHz, tend to wrap around terrain and be available even in the steep fiord environments of southern coastal Alaska.

This coverage is provided by the Hudson Falls station. Once a New York State Licensed Pilot I will be mandated to carry portable navigation computers that rely on the Hudson Falls DGPS signal.

Covering more than two-thirds of Earth's surface, the rising oceans tell the story of human caused warming and its impact on the planet. To understand and project these changes, scientists require global observing systems to measure ocean warming, the melting glaciers and ice sheets and sea level rise itself. The Ocean Surface Topography Science Team (OSTST) is an international body of more than 200 Earth scientists studying the oceans, the ice and even lakes and rivers.

The ongoing accuracy of globally averaged sea level as observed by the Jason series of altimeters is partly maintained and verified by the global tide gauge network. The Ocean Surface Topography Science Team supports efforts to maintain the global tide gauge network and co-located GPS stations to detect ground motion at many key tide gauges.  The OSTST relies on continuous monitoring of vertical land motion estimates from the maritime NDGPS sites in conjunction with tide gauges from the National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS). The proposed shutdown of maritime NDGPS sites will have a detrimental effect on the sea level community's ability to demonstrate the stability of altimetry measurements of sea level rise.

Because a relative sea level trend measured by a water level station includes both land motion and absolute sea level changes, there are often major differences in the trend from station to station. Although there are some small regional differences in the absolute sea level trends, most of the variation in the relative sea level trends is due to differential vertical land motion caused by glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), tectonic movement (seismic and interseismic), sedimentary basin subsidence, soil compaction, and fluid withdrawal.

Land motion changes resulting from a variety of regional geophysical phenomena need to be monitored continuously by the NDGPS sites. Tectonic activity produces both an instantaneous seismic displacement, as well as long-term interseismic deformation after the greatest magnitude earthquakes. Therefore, offsets and differing pre- and post-seismic rates may be possible at NWLON stations near plate boundaries in California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. Subsidence, soil compaction, and fluid withdrawal can all have varying effects on relative sea level trends in coastal Louisiana and Texas. Volcanic activity at the Big Island of Hawaiian can also change vertical land motion rates.

As the chairs of Ocean Surface Topography Science Team, we strongly recommend not shutting down maritime NDGPS sites without consulting the OSTST, NOAA, and the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) at least for specific sites that are very important for altimetry/tide gauge comparisons (e.g., Key West, Kodiak, Annapolis, Upolu Point, and Fort Stevens).

My name is Captain Sam Zapadinsky and I am a member of the Hudson River Pilots' Association.

This system utilizes differential signals from the Sandy Hook, NJ station and Hudson Falls, NY station. Most commercial traffic using the Hudson River call on the vital port of Albany, NY. The decommissioning of Hudson Falls, NY station will leave the upper portions of the Hudson River without a means to correct the GPS signal. 

Our navigation systems cannot utilize WAAS corrections due to the nature of the topography and the loss of signal on many courses along the route.

It is my opinion that without a redundant signal in the NY Harbor area or any differential signal in the upper portions of the Hudson River and Port of Albany, we will be compromising safe navigation on the river.

In this context, removing AK, HI, and other stations with extensive 'single coverage' areas makes little sense as the risk is extremely high with few to no alternatives, scientific/monitoring uses are extensive, etc.; while in populated and high use areas multiple options for addressing accuracy exist and risk of uncontrolled or unmitigated damages are less due to extensive response resources available.

In addition, decommissioning should only be recommended for public comment only after alternative data collection agencies have been contacted and explicitly declined interest in assuming operations (i.e. this should be a 2-step process 1. public comment on proposed transitions from NDGPS to an alternative network, and then 2. proposed decommissioning due to lack of risk and existing mitigation solutions exist along with little scientific/monitoring interest).

a) WAAS in Hawaii is not accurate or precise, as it is on the continent. We all know this, and are constantly advised so by NGS.
b) there are many locations in Hawaii with deep and steep valley walls, and in such cases DGPS corrections can be a virtual life-saver in terms of getting my work done.

I use DGPS weekly.

I use Trimble gear including their GPS beacon, along with my GeoXH 6000.

I am an environmental planning consultant, I write environmental assessments and I do a lot of my own field work related to archaeology and historic sites. I have been using DGPS since the early 2000's, and was disappointed that it was shut down in the CNMI and Guam.

This year I have been working on a hydropower plant location in Makaweli Valley, in the Waimea River Basin on Kauai, about 5 miles inland. I found that I was getting great DGPS corrected positioning at about the 2 meter RMS level. Whereas, with WAAS I could not get a corrected position.

I don't have the time, training or financial resources to invest in an RTK system, and the gear would be too cumbersome anyway for my type of work, which is often in remote locations, not accessible by vehicle.

Please keep the Hawaii DGPS stations operational until WAAS can effectively supersede them.

Please contact me if you have questions.

I am Professional Land Surveyor in Colorado (and currently serving as the President of the Professional Land Surveyors of Colorado) who utilizes GPS technology on a daily basis and I would not like to see the CORS portion of the station go away for the following reasons:

NDGPS is not the concern, but the station operating as a CORS is. NDPS provides a corrector. CORS provides much more - a resource that data can be pulled for post processing. Surveyors and mappers in Colorado as well as across the nation rely upon these sites.

Here in Colorado we are limited in the CORS coverage. In the area of PUB5, there are 2 stations 60 and 70 kms away, three 150- 200 kms away and the rest are well over 200 kms.

This site has been operating as a CORS for since 2012 originally as PUB1 and PUB 2, now PUB 5 and PUB6.

Loosing PUB5 and PUB6 would be detrimental to the State of Colorado, in particular, the area around Pueblo, CO. 

We would like to cooperate with USCG to see if this site could be re-established as a CORS at a nearby area. There are resources such as the technology transit center, Colorado Department of Transportation, City and County of Pueblo, ..


The general consensus from our user-community has been that, while the broadcast signal may be on its way out in terms of usefulness, the underlying CORS serve as highly stable (operationally) stations with long-term records in our active geodetic control network that is sorely lacking in redundancy.

Please consider relocating the CORS station in the vicinity of the existing station.

DGPS provides sub meter accuracy for GPS positioning for on water activities to include detailed hydrographic surveys, and vessel positioning.

DGPS positioning is used by the Dredge Potter, M/V Pathfinder, M/V Grand Tower, Dredge Tenders Kimmswick and Prairie Durocher, Survey Boat SkyII and at least three other Government survey boats have DGPS capability.

DGPS correction service by radio frequency performs very well throughout the District.  Oppositely, we are concerned about the less accurate satellite based augmentation service (WAAS) or other commercially available products and how consistent those products will perform throughout the District. Also, switching to a commercially provided correction service will require purchasing new GPS receivers and contractual arrangements to pay for such services.

The US Coast Guard led the way in developing DGPS and in engineering and modernizing the system, and are to be congratulated for their efforts in improving the integrity and accuracy of marine navigation. It is therefore extremely disappointing that the USCG consider the prime function of DGPS is to support buoy operations, and do not recognize a mandate to provide DGPS for the benefit of mariners, both national and international.
 
Provision of a high quality service to mariners requires dual coverage DGPS in areas of high traffic volumes and risk, which surely includes the Pacific, Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Alaska may have lower traffic volumes but arguably higher risk factors. 

Furthermore, maintenance of dual coverage sites and their infrastructure offers options in the development of Resilient PNT solutions such as Ranging-Mode or eLoran - solutions to problems the marine world is belatedly becoming aware of.

We conduct ecological monitoring of natural resources in and around nine National Parks in the Great Lakes region, and collect GPS location information regularly while doing field work. Accurate position information is critical for such applications as forest plots, water quality site locations, or in collecting ground control in support of aerial photography or lidar collection projects.
We regularly use the National CORS network along with various state DOT CORS stations for post-processing GPS data. Losing Wisconsin Point, WI and Upper Keweenaw Point, MI will hamper our ability to post-process our data. We typically use Trimble equipment, often requiring a set of 3 stations for accurate post-processing (H-Star), and these stations are essential for good triangulation. We also use POSPac software in post-processing multibeam sonar data, again having multiple stations is critical to achieving the best accuracy possible. Redundancy is also important as there are fairly frequent data drop-outs creating gaps in correction files. 
It is surprising to hear of these stations being decommissioned at a time when more and more applications of location information are being developed. I urge you to reconsider this decision.

The impacts of such changes on infrastructure and property are profound in low lying areas (i.e., most coastal regions), with a much greater risk of water damage when the sea level rises relative to the community. And rising seas are only one part of the change in sea level; the changes in the elevation of land are typically just as great as the changes in sea level. NDGPS sites monitor these changes in sea elevation, and hence play a very important role in the monitoring of sea level. Changes in elevation happen as a result of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), tectonic movement, sedimentary subsidence, compacting of soil, and the withdrawal of fluids from the ground. Consequently, the rate of change of land elevation is quite varied across the US coasts. The observations proposed to be cut play a critical role in understanding sea level change from the perspective of management of that change. 

The Ocean Observation Panel for Climate (OOPC) has already recommended, in our contribution to a report of the status of climate observations, that the number of stations with this capability be increased. This will help in understanding how changes in land and sea combine to modify sea level in the coastal regions where people will experience the impacts of these changes. The recommendation is based on input from broad research communities as well as from communities impacted by these changes. If some sites must be cut, we recommend that the selection of sites be done in consultation with the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS), which can recommend a subset of the coastal sites that are of higher priority.

Re: Public Comments on Docket Number DOT-OST-2015-0105 Decommissioning of Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS) Transmitter Sites

The National Park Service Vegetation Inventory program coordinates and collaborates with all the territories of the Pacific Rim, Hawaiian Islands, the Caribbean, CONUS, and Alaska to serve over 300 Parks, Monuments, and Preserves.  These resources of the American public are remote, rugged, and loved by them.  Many of these resources are monitored and mapped by many remote sensing technologies, and GPS is the primary basis of sample point location, re-survey of sites, and support of GIS and digital mapping efforts.  The use of CORS as a tool to support and manage these public assets is a non-replaceable tool, provides the only free NAD83 tie to the National Spatial Reference Frame, and serves these remote locations without backup.  A typical mapping effort will collect several hundred points for ecological study, and several thousand for map verification and accuracy assessment. In over 300 Park units, this represents a significant and irreplaceable public investment.   Positioning and resurvey of these areas using the GPS as a utility demands the accuracy of CORS for post processing.

The Department of Transportation serves the American Public and the Federal Agencies as a liaison and representative of agency needs related to GPS.  The collection of this input is the second time the Department of Transportation has asked for this survey, with similar results.  The evidence from the field, the known loss of functionality and safety in the Great Lakes and northern tier regions across to the Dakotas and Montana, and the common dependence on CORS in all regions of the US (CONUS and all other Regions) for post processing and data management all direct the Department of Transportation to a currently irreplaceable utility used by industry, the public, and public servants alike.

A credible cross-funded process exists to continue these services. Dropping NDGPS and retaining CORS retains the post-processing functionality, at a minimum.  The resources and the public deserve to have an adequate positioning tool, and the CORS has proven that capability for post processed positions to the NAD83 reference frame and the future datums that will follow.  The land management agencies of this county and our sister nations and First Nations all use GPS positioning to serve and protect the public lands.  You have an overwhelming response of the need for NDGPS and CORS to serve those needs.   Once again, make the decision to continue what is now a common utility and as a minimum retain the CORS capability for science and public lands protection and management.

As the Superintendent of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve (GBNPP), I would like to share our deep concerns with your proposal to decommission the Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System (NDGPS) site in Gustavus Alaska.  GBNPP relies heavily on the Gustavus NDGPS site, both for post-processed differential correction of essential resource and maintenance features, as well as serving vital corrections to the navigation systems of large cruise ships and other vessels in park waters.

GBNPP has five Trimble professional GPS mapping units all capable of post-processing.  Since 2001, the park has differentially corrected thousands of files using the Gustavus station.  These files have contained data for mapping natural and cultural resources as well as utilities, infrastructure, trails, and boundaries.  Differential correction using the reliable Gustavus site allows enhancing accuracy from 10 meters to sub-meter.  This type of accuracy is essential to re-locate broken water pipes under snow cover, revisit remote campsites, or to re-survey cryptic archeological features.  The Gustavus site has been our most reliable base station since the late 1990's.  Although a recent map shows Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) sites surrounding our park, these have not been as reliable as the U.S. Coast Guard station and have had gaps in data availability.   Additionally, if the Gustavus station is lost, the distance from northern Glacier Bay to a differential correction base station will increase 20 km (from 80km to 100km) and the distance from the majority of our park's infrastructure in southern Glacier Bay to a base station will increase from 10 km to 55km, a 5 fold increase.

Additionally, the loss of the Gustavus NDGPS station will seriously compromise the integrity of marine navigation systems within the park. In the comments for this Federal Registry Notice, please refer to the Southeast Alaska Pilots Association recommendation for retaining NDGPS for electronic navigation.   GBNPP is a marine park and our 500,000+ yearly visitors rely heavily on large ships up to 1000 feet in length navigating narrow fjords.  Reliance on Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) may be suitable in lower latitudes or above 1000 feet elevation, but not at sea level in steep narrow fjords in northern Glacier Bay.   NDGPS remains an important redundant and park-wide augmentation for navigation in Glacier Bay, and is therefore vital to the protection of one of the most environmentally sensitive maritime areas in the country.      

The Gustavus NDGPS station has been a reliable and highly valued site since its inception.  We strongly urge you to continue this much needed service.     

Sincerely,

Philip N. Hooge, Ph.D.

The USCG DGPS sites proposed for decommissioning in Alaska are a critical component of state's already precariously sparse GPS CORS network.

Southeastern Alaska is characterized by steep, thickly forested terrain and narrow channels with strong currents. Dense cloud cover and strong winds are common occurrences in this area where there are also several critical marine habitat areas. The NDGPS broadcast signal is used for navigation by marine vessels and aircraft as an augmentation to unreliable or insufficient GPS reception. 

Because accurate positioning data is used for a variety of purposes, including navigation, land management decisions, land use planning, research, forest monitoring, inventories, and assessments, the Alaska Geospatial Council strongly advocates maintaining the Alaska USCG NDGPS stations. Cost of removal of these sites has been estimated at up to $30M per site, whereas the annual cost of operations of all NDGPS sites nationally is less than $6M. At the very minimum, Alaska's USCG NDGPS stations need to continue to operate as part of the CORS network even if the broadcast signal is eliminated. They are needed for redundancy and maintaining an adequate CORS network for differential correction. 

If the USCG is unable to continue maintenance of these sites, please provide maintenance costs, site agreements, and any other requirements to allow continued operations by an alternate entity as an alternative to decommissioning. ",,,,,,,

- It should continue at least until the issue of a backup to GPS is settled. The existing hardware and infrastructure at these sites may be an asset that the government will find very helpful in the near future.
- The associated CORS are very important to the overall CORS network in the Inter-mountain West, Alaska and Hawaii. CORS sites are spread out already to the point that it limits the capabilities of the government to meet its mission. If the sites are removed this will get worse. The result will be that government personnel will have to stay on a point much longer costing more money. Additionally, some operations to not lend themselves to static occupation of a single point. This issue will increase for coastal areas when fewer CORS are available such as in Assateague Island, MD. We need accurate elevations to respond to sea level rise and climate change. See attachments.
-  When the Reference Network becomes completely virtual it is important that we have real time access to the reference frame. NDGPS provides this now for code-phase corrections. If the CORS portion of the NDGPS sites remained and streamed differential data on the internet then this would extend to carrier and code for greater accuracy. We require greater accuracy of our elevation surveys to respond to climate change. This is one example of many that carrier-phase corrections coming from the NDGPS CORS would go a long way towards fulfilling.
- O and M of the NDGPS system is about $5.5 million dollars annually. I would say that is a pretty good return on the governments investment. This could be even less if the broadcast portion were shut down and the streaming of the CORS differential data was extended to the internet.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2015-0105-0160/attachment_8.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2015-0105-0160/attachment_7.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2015-0105-0160/attachment_7.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2015-0105-0160/attachment_6.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2015-0105-0160/attachment_5.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2015-0105-0160/attachment_4.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2015-0105-0160/attachment_3.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2015-0105-0160/attachment_2.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2015-0105-0160/attachment_1.pdf",

NDGPS is not the concern, but rather the station operating as a CORS station. CORS stations provides much more of a resource for Surveyors and Mappers in Colorado as well as across the nation.

In Colorado we are limited in the number of CORS  stations operating. In the area of PUB5, there are 2 stations 60 and 70 kms away, three 150- 200 kms away and the rest are well over 200 kms.

This site has been operating as a CORS site since 2012, originally as PUB1 and PUB 2, now PUB 5 and PUB6.

Loosing PUB5 and PUB6 would be detrimental to the State of Colorado, in particular, the area around Pueblo, CO. 

We would like to cooperate with USCG to see if this site could be re-established as a CORS station at a nearby area. There are resources such as the technology transit center, Colorado Department of Transportation, City and County of Pueblo, ..

The general consensus from our user-community has been that, while the broadcast signal may be on its way out in terms of usefulness, the underlying CORS station serves as highly stable stations adding long-term records to our active geodetic control network that is lacking in redundancy.

Please consider this request to support the Surveying and Mapping community.",,,,,,,

Decreased stations in remote areas could increase the probability of catastrophic events associated with navigational errors and decrease scientific capacity as location accuracy is lost. To reduce potential impacts there must be alternative solutions:  

1. Alternative solutions must improve navigation capabilities in areas currently covered by the stations proposed for decommissioning. Doing so could improve human safety and prevent catastrophic events. According to the current DOT notice (DOT-OST-2015-0105), in response to the 2013 notice on station decommissioning ""ship pilots in particular noted that DGPS can be critical in confined waterways for precise ship handling maneuvers."" This statement indicates stations could be detrimental or harmful when ships are operating in confined waterways where non-line-of-sight navigation is necessary. 

These waterways are particularly prevalent along Alaska's complex coastlines. These coastlines are not only dramatically underrepresented in the current network of sites, but have limited bathymetric maps, elevation datasets, and satellite coverage. Removing stations would further decrease navigational capabilities along these coastlines and could increase the probability of catastrophic accidents in these vulnerable habitats. These coastlines provide habitat for threatened and endangered species and one of the largest and most sustainable fisheries in the world. Loss of threatened and endangered species would compromise international treaties and impact biodiversity at a global-scale. Negative impacts on these coastal habitats and fisheries would affect subsistence fisheries in Native communities, the commercial fisheries and tourism industries, and the availability of a healthy food resource that is globally distributed.

The current notice states that sites selected for decommissioning are in areas that are not ""generally used"". In Alaska, areas that are not ""generally used"" as major shipping routes have extremely poor communication and emergency response capabilities. The probability for catastrophic events to occur in these in confined waterways where navigational and response capabilities are hindered is relatively high and release of fuel, oil, invasive shipboard species (e.g. rats) can have much greater impacts than they would in less remote areas. These impacts could devastate terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, subsistence resources, local communities, and the safety of USFWS staff, partners, local community members, and others. 

These same areas will likely experience increasing traffic with changes in climate, fisheries regulations, oil prices, and development. In the future, climate change, loss of sea-ice, and increased frequency and severity of storm events will increase the need for improved navigation in these areas. The focus should be on making these areas safer and less prone to major catastrophes. Not demobilizing.     

Coverage of the current DGPS network is already limited to less than 50% of Alaska's coast. Much of this coast is complex, confined, and remote; satellite coverage is poor throughout the entire state; and response capabilities are marginal at best. Yet these shorelines are some of the world's most important and productive habitats for fish and wildlife. Assisted by ocean and wind currents, water, fish, and wildlife along these coastlines migrate to habitats across the globe. They support unique subsistence communities and commercial fisheries with cultures that don't exist anywhere else in the world. A reduction in the already gross navigational capabilities along these vulnerable, remote coastlines would be absurd. The entire Aleutian Chain would be completely unrepresented. Places like Kodiak Alaska would not be covered. Fifty percent of Southeast Alaska would not be covered.   

2. If coastal and inland sites are decommissioned there must be alternative solutions that maintain or improve GPS location accuracy in these regions. Loss of stations and associated location accuracy could be a major setback for scientific efforts, land managers, communities, and others assessing the impacts of and planning for the effects of climate change at local, regional, and global scales. This would be particularly harmful in Alaska which lacks a high-resolution elevation dataset and where satellite coverage is extremely poor. 

3. Work with NOAA, USFWS, and others to co-locate climate reference network stations, or something similar to improve navigation and emergency response capabilities, GPS location accuracy, and our understanding of and ability to forecast the effects of climate change. In addition to existing sites, coverage in Alaska must be improved and include sites in Northern Alaska. Partnering with others in Japan, Russia, and Canada to create similar sites should also be considered.

As the former Chief of Operations for Rock Island District, my channel maintenance depending tremendously on the NDGPS System. The cost reductions of our channel maintenance were much more than significant and improved accuracy of channel surveys. Prior to the NDGPS to perform a survey the survey team would sut transponders on the shore to establish horizantal locations. This was a very time consuming effort with a lower degree of accuracy. Many times the surveys were required to determine the locations of shoals. With the NDGPS system the hydrotrafic survel boat could commence surveys could start immediately on arrival at the shoal site. Installation of tarnsponders may have been delayed due to weather  daylight and other causes. Every minute the shoal caused a closure was costing the tows $400.00 per hour in delays. The time to start dredging could result in a backup of many tows. 

The farm interests have become very heavy users of the system in controlling, feritlizing and harvesting crops. Tractors are equipped with GPS systems. The system can control plowing patterns. The harvest can be closely monitored for yiealds as crops are are harvested. at the next season that data is used to control fertilize applications  to save fertilizer costs and more uniform yields. 

I don't know about the automotive, cell phone and other system use of the NDGPS System, but I feel my use  in navigation while driving on streets and highways provides accurate data on tmy location to make accurate turnes.

The advantages are way beyond the initial floating navigation purposes. As Chief of Operations I fully supported the partnership between the Corps and Coast Guard to establish the Upper Mississippi River System. Rock Island had communication towars the fit the requirement of the NDGPS equipment. We entered into a partneship agreement for the usage of the towers. I still believe the system is a great benefit to the navigation requirements and has become a national assess the must be maintained.

I am a concerned citizen that believes DOT is not doing enough to protect the public.
The lithium battery regulations have changed every two years for at least the last 10 years. 
 ICAO and US DOT have gone to great lengths to produce more onerous and restrictive regulations but little to address
 the unscrupulous shippers that knowingly do not comply with regulations to avoid the costs associated with compliance.  
Introducing further restrictions, complicated requirements and high cost packaging will only exasperate the prevalence of 
non-compliant shipments from these shippers.  The non-compliant shipments are difficult to detect and are typically only 
discovered when a carrier experiences a situation where the package is damaged in transport in which case it may be 
reported to an appropriate enforcement agency.  Generally there is a lack of enforcement authority over shippers in certain 
parts of the world especially in jurisdictions where there is the highest likelihood of non-compliance.  As a concerned citizen I do 
not believe that ICAO or the US DOT have focused on this issue which is the most critical factor to reducing the risk of 
incidents aboard aircraft.  Compliant US companies are being penalized with more onerous and expensive requirements while those 
that deliberately violate the regulations continue to do so without being held accountable.  

The agenda for the public meeting should include the enforcement issue and DOT should explain what they are doing to address it.

-Lithium batteries sold as new, but actually refurbished
-OEM, refurbished and counterfeit batteries are manufactured into packs, packaged, sold, and shipped, full state of charge, without enough safety mechanisms, and poorly manufactured, for use in all types of battery powered toys, electric bikes, scooters, computers etc.

I have major concerns though, that the main concern seems to be the regulations that are already in place. It would seem more sensible to put a huge effort into identifying and penalizing the manufacturers that do not comply with the regulations. Moving forward with changing the regulations to make lithium battery shipments safer, will do nothing to improve safety unless offenders are first identified, and prosecuted. Stronger regulations will effectively ""punish"" the ""good guys"", making their products more expensive, while allowing the ""bad guys"" to continue with their bad practices, enabling them to keep their costs down. To add insult, the US Government, will then insist, in many cases, that contractors purchase the lowest price item. There is something drastically wrong with this scenario. While I am certainly on board with any regulation change that improves safety, while allowing continued delivery of quality products, I would implore the DOT to look at options to ensure regulations are followed by all, before changing them. 

I am not educated on what processes are in place already to ensure quality of products being shipped to the US from foreign nations, however, I know, in cases such as Chinese manufacturers, unless they are caught immediately, they disappear, and pop up as a different name within days. Inspection has to happen at the point of shipment. In some cases, it is easy to identify non-compliant product, however, an in depth inspection is warranted, with destructive physical analysis included on a percentage of parts. Of course, there will be a cost to this, which should be absorbed by the manufacturer, or country of origin, in the form of a penalty. I would think, shutting the door on these manufacturers would not take long and send a strong message.

Besides the safety issues of shipping by air, these products are getting through to the commercial stream, and while they may not have caused a catastrophic air issue, they have and are causing destruction of US citizen property and in some cases have caused loss of life. We owe it to all, to look at the real issue and stop the import of non-compliant product to the US. Then, and only then, can you look sensibly at changing the regulations that exist.

We have presented at many government conferences on the issues of safety and counterfeit issues, and have managed government battery testing facilities. We would gladly share these presentations, and any useful knowledge if there is interest. ",,,,,,,

FAA said that the results which indicate that as few as 2.6 lithium cells could damage a cargo liner and compromise the fire suppression capabilities of an aircraft would not be used to justify further regulatory restrictions.  WP29 that was submitted to the ICAO DGP meeting uses the FAA data to justify removing the small battery and cell exceptions.  WP29 states:

1.3 Considering that Section II of Packing Instructions 965 and 968 only permits a small
quantity of cells or batteries to be carried in the same package (except for lithium ion batteries not
exceeding 2.7 Wh and lithium metal batteries not exceeding 0.3 g of lithium, for which there is a weight
limit not a limit in numbers) and taking into consideration that this allowance exceeds the safe limits
established by the tests for the number of lithium batteries in a single cargo compartment of an aircraft
commonly used in air transport, there is no reason for maintaining the provisions of Section II in the
Technical Instructions.

This paper substantiates the concerns raised by participants of the public meeting.  The FAA test and conclusions are being used to justify a change to the regulations that will have serious, costly and overly burdensome implications to companies that are shipping their batteries safely while doing nothing if not incentivizing those companies that intentionally fail to comply and put the public at risk.  

 The Information Quality Act (IQA), sometimes referred to as the Data Quality Act, was enacted in December 2000 as Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-554). The act required the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidance to federal agencies designed to ensure the ""quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity"" of information disseminated to the public. It also required agencies to establish administrative mechanisms that allow affected persons to seek correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agencies that does not comply with the OMB guidance.  FAA has not followed DOT's established guidelines from a quality, objectivity, utility, or integrity basis.  You can view DOT's guidelines at:

http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/subject_areas/statistical_policy_and_research/data_quality_guidelines/html/guidelines.html 

The OMB/DOT guidelines define ""influential"" information as information that the agency reasonably can determine ""will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private sector decisions."" The guidelines assign to DOT the task of defining this term in ways appropriate to the agency and its various programs. The Department emphasizes that to be influential; information must have a clear and substantial impact. In rulemaking, influential information is scientific, financial, or statistical information that can reasonably be regarded as being one of the major factors in the resolution of one or more key issues in a significant rulemaking, as that term is defined in Executive Order 12866. These reports are certainly influential and are driving regulations that will cost Americans and US companies hundreds of millions of dollars.

As a long term RC (remote control) hobbyist / operator (cars, planes, now multi-rotors), I have been safely participating in this hobby for over 30 years.  I recognize that the careless actions of some have created an environment where a registration requirement such as this is necessary.  

However, as a father of a minor who also participates in this hobby, I am greatly concerned about protecting my child. He will soon be 13 years old and thus required to register.  If an unfortunate accident occurs (even with my direct supervision) and he has a fly-away model loss, anyone who finds that model (regardless of whether there are negative consequences of the loss or not) will have direct access to his information and have the potential of exploiting him in the situation(1).  The same thing can be said of myself (45 year old male), and even though I am an adult and better prepared for such events, there remains significant risk.  

So, because of: 
A) the previously mentioned careless and foolish actions of others
B) press sensationalism within our nation
C) the ubiquitous association of all things RC flight (sUAS = RC planes, helicopters, multi-rotors, etc.) with the term drone
D) our nation's legitimate use of military drones - 
we now face an American public which is uneducated, paranoid, and openly hostile to a long established hobby.  Examples of this are the numerous cases of 'drones' shot down by the public (2a-2c), unjustified assaults against RC fliers (3), marketing of anti-drone ammo (4), and the marketing of (illegal) drone jammers (5).  I'm sure you can understand how having law enforcement agents between my son (or myself) and a hostile member of the public is a highly desirable outcome.  

You have taken appropriate actions to help protect the public from careless sUAS operators by enacting this registration system and driving further education for sUAS operators.   Please take into consideration that sUAS / RC operators (especially minors) may also need to be protected from a careless, uneducated, and increasingly paranoid public.  Ensure that the sUAS database is not publicly available, but instead reflects the statement in the UAS registration FAQ (6): ""The FAA will be able to see the data that you enter. The FAA is using a contractor to maintain the website and database, and that contractor also will be able to see the data that you enter. Like the FAA, the contractor is required to comply with strict legal requirements to protect the confidentiality of the personal data you provide. Under certain circumstances, law enforcement officers might also be able to see the data.""

Thank you for your consideration of my concerns.

At some point, a reasonable balance needs to be achieved between the rights of a tiny percentage of airline passengers whose disabilities currently give them priority over other passengers, and the majority of the people on the airplane.  The current expectation is that those latter passengers' rights have less priority, and consequently they must yield space, convenience, and absorb the cost (passed on indirectly by the airline) of special accommodation for the disabled people.  

It is not fair or reasonable to airline, or to the majority of the population, for example, to require a special, accessible lavatory in an aircraft with only one or two lavatories, nor to mandate special seat design, seat pitch, aisle width, etc., to serve a few passengers who may not even be aboard the majority of flights.  Similarly, it is not fair to the passengers or cabin crew to allow an unaccompanied (or even, in some cases, accompanied) passenger so severely disabled as to be unable to attend to his/her personal hygiene, is malodorous, unable to evacuate the airplane without blocking or delaying other passengers, unable to use a standard seat belt or fit into a standard aircraft seat or requires other significant special accommodations.  Safety issues as well as convenience for the majority of the passengers need to be considered here.      

""Service animals"" were also addressed in this document.  It is widely known that ""service animals"" -- many of which generate significant discomfort and inconvenience for other passengers -- are being allowed in aircraft passenger cabins under circumstances where the associated passengers' real need for those animals' presence is questionable at best, and the animals' eligibility to be there is equally questionable.  Few people would object to a blind person's seeing-eye dog.  Many people would object to an obnoxious, yapping ""companion"" dog allowed aboard on the basis of a bogus note from a doctor.  The process for identifying which service animals are eligible for transportation in the passenger cabin obviously needs to be made more stringent.    

As these requirements are evolving, they become an increasingly unreasonable economic burden upon the airlines, and infringe the individual liberties of other passengers on the airplane . . . and consequently, I believe that applicable rules and policies need to be adjusted to establish a fair balance between the rights of disabled people and other passengers. 

I am a retired airline pilot and frequent airline traveler.  ",,,,,,,

The FAA rules and regulations for service animals should reflect those of the Justice Department as defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Emotional support animals I have observed on flights have appeared to be more frightened of flying and/or being on an airplane than their handlers - who supposedly need them. I've seen emotional support dogs wearing anti-anxiety jackets that are manufactured specifically for reducing stress in canines. The dogs more often than not bark at everyone and everything on the plane, including my hearing dog. 

ACCESSIBLE RESTROOMS
I believe that at least one (1) accessible restroom should be available on every airplane. When someone who needs one IS aboard a flight and unable to use the inaccessible restrooms, THAT is a definite hardship. If no one who ""needs"" the accessible restroom is on a flight, it would be available for anyone on board.

CAPTIONS
Airlines SHOULD provide captions for movies / entertainment on flights. Being unable to hear what's being said should NOT prevent those of us with hearing loss and/or deafness from enjoying the in-flight provided entertainment.",,,,,,,

I have a moderate-severe to severe hearing loss. I frequently travel by air for my work, pleasure, and service as an elected official.  

As a person with hearing loss, I dread all aspects of air travel because of the industry's  general disregard for people with this hidden disability.  On the planes, I cannot understand many cabin announcements (they are usually loud enough, sometimes painfully so, but often unintelligible).  I regularly get passed by for beverage and food service because I can't hear or understand the flight attendant's announcements/requests as they pass down the aisle.  Some planes have videos with captions showing the emergency procedures.  Most passenger aircraft do not.   I do not request any digi-players or other onboard video entertainment because it is generally not captioned.  And I am fortunate - my hearing loss fluctuates - I have some days/weeks/months when I hear quite well, others when I cannot.  I imagine that air travel is even more frustrating for my friends with consistently severe hearing loss.

While this is beyond the scope of this rule making, I find the entire process of navigating the airport frustrating, embarrassing, and insulting.  Going through the TSA checkpoint, there are very very few written instructions.  As I recently passed through a checkpoint, apparently there was a change in procedure.  When the TSA official called out an instruction to me, I didn't understand and said I have a hearing loss (and gestured towards my ears while saying this.)  The response was the same as it always is - they just repeat the instruction in the same voice, apparently at the same volume, only this time with a look of irritation. They NEVER offer any additional explanation or offer to write up a note or point to a written instruction.    (I have written to TSA and asked how to proceed and they said I can contact any TSA agent outside the checkpoint and ask for assistance.  This hasn't been successful yet.)  Airline boarding instructions - pretty much garbled.  Airport announcements.  Often loud and hard to make out.  

I urge the Dept. of Transportation to adopt the proposed rule making for assisting passengers on aircraft. It may seem like a big step for the airlines, but for people with hearing loss or mobility challenges, these are long overdue and welcome steps towards what (I hope will be) further changes to make travel fully accessible.

Our Organization would like to work with you, as well as with airline manufacturers, on the future designs of new airplanes to be wheelchair accessible. We are specifically concerned about power chairs, in which the passenger is unable to transfer themselves, or in which traveling in a standard airline seat would risk their physical health and safety.
Currently, neither the Department of Transportation's Air Carrier Access Act nor the ADA resolves the needs for those who are dependent on wheelchairs and commercial flight.  The ADAs requirements for public transportation providers are generally the same whether they are public agencies or private contractors.  Standards apply to facilities and vehicles.  Unfortunately the airline industry has been excluded from having to make revisions to existing aircraft or from having to currently make any advancement in designs for future planes going into production.  We are requesting that the airline industry as a whole come together to address the lack of progress in this area and address the needs of the disabled flyer who uses  a wheelchair and can not be transferred or travel safely in a regular seat.
All Wheels Up, Inc.is here to be liaisons of information from the wheelchair industry, rehabilitation regulations industry, as well as providing financial data, to show you how safe and profitable it will be for wheelchair users to travel commercially.    We are also a professional organization that understands things do not change overnight. The reality is that at the end of the day a big business like yours wants to know the dollars and cents. 
So, what is the big picture, and how do you benefit?   First of all, we are not asking you to retrofit existing planes. This would be a huge expense. What we are asking is for you to look to the future and set the ground work for the future of aviation accessibility. And secondly, with the increasing number of people using wheelchairs each year, the airline industry will realize significant revenue exponential. 
As an industry, you are not just excluding the one person who is disabled from flying , but you are losing the revenue of the approximately four additional seat sales.  A disabled person rarely flies alone. They travel with their families, as well as, and in many cases with a care taker or nurse.  Do you want this this family of four, plus one care taker driving, to their next destination due to how difficult it is to fly?  if you get just half of the population that are in power chairs that currently does not fly to fly  your revenue would increase in the multi million dollar range. 
In 2008, one particular airline spent over $1 Million in wheelchair repairs.   This figure also does not include the expenses that airlines outlay every year to disabled travelers in lawsuits, free tickets, and additional items to prevent lawsuits.
Solution
The next step:  All Wheels Up has raised the funds and has done the research and will be conducting the first ever crash test of wheelchairs for commercial flight at an FAA approved Crash test facility.  We would like you to request the major aircraft manufacturers (Boeing and Airbus) to consider a design for wheel chair accessible cabins.  With this request, the FAA has confirmed they will act upon our request to crash test wheelchairs.  Take note, a large majority of the work and reports have already been conducted.  The FAA would only need to expand on the research already done from the company Q'straint, whose restraining systems have passed the 20 G crash test, while all air craft passenger seats have only passed a 16 G crash test. Due to this study alone, the FAA is excited to work on the crash testing wheelchairs for commercial flight.  In addition, hundreds of wheelchair models have already undergone extensive crash testing by the RERC  WTS (Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center on Wheelchair Transportation Safety) due to the WC18 regulation funded by the NIDRR (National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research).  These tests conducted show all wheelchairs have also passes a 20 G frontal crash test, again surpassing the 16G crash test standard for commercial airline seats.
All Wheels up, and like minded companies, have the solution. All we need is you to take the next step with us. We look forward to you having further conversations with us regarding crash testing wheelchairs for commercial flight.

Allowing a person such as myself to stay seated in my specially designed chair would make flying so much easier as well as much more comfortable.  I feel like a second-class citizen when I have to be transferred (lifted) from my wheelchair onto an aisle chair to be transferred into the airplane and then transferred (lifted) into the seat on the plane.  I worry about being dropped.  Most importantly, I worry that the people helping me might hurt themselves while transferring me.  Most often it has been the baggage handlers who have been assisting in my lifts, but I have also had firemen help as well.  I also worry about damage to my wheelchair while it is stored with the other luggage.  My wheelchair is rather expensive, approximately $25,000, and it's not easy to replace any specialized pieces that may get broken.  If I was allowed to board an airplane and then stay seated in my wheelchair during the flight, it would save a lot of time boarding, allow me to stay comfortable during the flight, keep people from becoming injured, and allow everyone to enjoy the flight.

Thank you for your time,

The ADA defines a service animal as: ""...any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability... The work or tasks performed by a service animal must be directly related to the handler's disability. Examples of work or tasks include, but are not limited to, assisting individuals who are blind or have low vision with navigation and other tasks, alerting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to the presence of people or sounds, providing non-violent protection or rescue work, pulling a wheelchair, assisting an individual during a seizure, alerting individuals to the presence of allergens, retrieving items such as medicine or the telephone, providing physical support and assistance with balance and stability to individuals with mobility disabilities, and helping persons with psychiatric and neurological disabilities by preventing or interrupting impulsive or destructive behaviors."" 

This notion that there are a lot of passengers falsely claiming their pets as service animals is unfounded. This premise has not been borne out by research. The rationale has been that passengers have tried to say their dog is for a psychiatric disability. Given the stigma surrounding mental illness, very few people are going to fake a service dog for a psychiatric disability. 

First, although it is not specifically addressed in the proposed rulemaking, individuals with psychiatric disabilities are currently treated differently than individuals with other disabilities. They are the only class of individuals with a disability that must provide documentation for their disability. I propose that the requirements for individuals using a service dog for a psychiatric disability be removed, and those individuals treated the same as any other passenger with a disability. A service dog for an individual with a psychiatric disability is trained to the same standard as for other disabilities. By imposing the 48 hours advance notice and the letter from a mental health professional, the ACAA places an undue burden on this class of individuals, especially if last minute travel for an emergency or death in the family must be arranged. It further stigmatizes this population. I support leaving in place the requirements for passengers flying with an emotional support animal. These are pets, not highly trained service animals.

The ADA goes on to state: Inquiries. A public accommodation shall not ask about the nature or extent of a person's disability, but may make two inquiries to determine whether an animal qualifies as a service animal. A public accommodation may ask if the animal is required because of a disability and what work or task the animal has been trained to perform. A public accommodation shall not require documentation, such as proof that the animal has been certified, trained, or licensed as a service animal. Generally, a public accommodation may not make these inquiries about a service animal when it is readily apparent that an animal is trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability (e.g., the dog is observed guiding an individual who is blind or has low vision, pulling a person's wheelchair, or providing assistance with stability or balance to an individual with an observable mobility disability)."" Note that the ADA states that when it is readily apparent that an animal is trained to do work or perform tasks, generally the public accommodation may not inquire whether it is a service dog and what work or tasks the dog is trained to do. A non disabled individual can easily be ferreted out by asking what work or task the dog is trained to do.  A service dog can be identified by its training and behavior. Granted, even service dogs have off days, but they are far better behaved than pets.

The ACAA is currently at odds with the ADA on both of these counts. By aligning the definition of service animal with the ADA, it reduces the confusion between the myriad of laws out there that pertain to service animals. Adopting a uniform definition of a service animals helps everyone, not just the service dog handler. Asking the handler to name the work or tasks the dog has been trained to do (if it is not readily apparent) is yet another way to determine if the handler is truly disabled. The ADA also states that a service dog may be properly excluded: ""A public accommodation may ask an individual with a disability to remove a service animal from the premises if: (i) The animal is out of control and the animal's handler does not take effective action to control it; or (ii) The animal is not housebroken."" Again, the ADA has safeguards in place to protect the public accommodation.

I strongly encourage changing the definition of service animal to align with the definition in the ADA.",,,,,,,

Recently, I've moved to a small town which is near a small airport.  Because of the airport's size, the smaller planes are used; ones with no first class, and the bulkhead is the exit row.  The seats on these planes are smaller than ones found on larger planes. At this time, I have a German Shepherd service dog who will be flying with me in February.  On these smaller planes, it is difficult (if not impossible) to adhere to the requirement that she fit in front of my legs in the smaller rows.  Thankfully the agent at Alaska Air agreed to try to keep the seat next to us so that my dog has the ability to fit while still staying out of the isle.  Since more and more disabled people are flying with their service dogs, I would propose that one of the rows be removed, making a second bulkhead-sized seating area.  That way every flight is capable of carrying up to 4 people with service dogs or conditions where a person is unable to bend their knees.

In addition, I propose that there be an accessible bathroom on all flights.  People like me are unable to walk more than a few steps without an assistive device or my harnessed service dog.  When traveling alone, I would not be able to use the facilities because my service animal will not fit in the lavatory with me. While my upcoming trip is only a 2 hour flight, we do have trips planned which would include flight legs 5 hours or longer.  For both me and my service dog, that is just too long to wait.

Thank you for considering the concerns of disabled people such as myself.

Traveling has become increasingly difficult since 9-11 and airlines increasingly greedy in turning the planes into human stables. My family is very reluctant to travel anywhere that requires air planes because past trips have been so difficult. The leg room is completely inadequate for the mobility challenged and the bathrooms are ridiculous for anyone.
Boarding and unboarding has been very difficult in many places either because the airline was not properly prepared (like on the Big Island of Hawaii) or because the flight is on a small plane. Security is also difficult. My family member is 77 and has a knee replacement in one leg and a steel plate in the other, so she always has to experience the extended search. Cards should be issued to disabled travelers so they are not subjected to this procedure every time they fly. It's tiring and humiliating for them.",,,,,,,

We were pleased to see the announcement https://cms.dot.gov/briefing-room/dot-explores-consensus-based-initiative-make-flying-easier-individuals-disabilities and also the notice of intent http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=DOT-OST-2015-0246-0001 pertaining to Air Travel Access. 

For the membership of the CCAC (CCACaptioning.org) and many others, we submit these concerns: 

IFE must become accessible with quality captioning that offers reasonable choices to all airline passengers since, as paying passengers, we and the airlines benefit from accessible in-flight entertainments. However, IFE seems a too-narrow focus for this Negotiated Rulemaking Process. 
 
Importantly and in addition to IFE concerns, we strongly suggest two other areas that are vital for access and inclusion of people with hearing loss and deafness who use captioning for understanding speech - (1) airport announcements and also (2) in-flight announcements.
 
Safety in airports and in-flight also are surely major concerns for everyone. Announcements in the airport, always considered essential for air travel, need to become visible with quality speech-to-text (live captioning). Sudden emergencies of any sort, gate changes after arriving at gates (not to miss the flight), and any other airport announcements can use existing technologies to create access with live captioning, not only for deaf and hard of hearing people, but also for so many with different fist languages or other conditions that use captioning for comprehension (e.g. autism, tinnitus, auditory perceptual differences). 

Similarly, we ague that in-flight announcements are vital for safety and equal communication access in-flight. Information access of any and all announcements is required. Not only people who are deaf or have a hearing loss need this information, live and real-time; there are many others in-flight (hearing also) who do not understand these announcements, and safety and calm environments in-flight are just as important as always, for everyone.  

We hope that the DOT agrees and finds ways to include these concerns along with IFE matters. 
Respectfully,
Lauren E. Storck (PhD).

It is collaborative and provides significant influential power to the stakeholders impacted by the regulation. The reg neg process has been previously utilized specifically for this airline disability access issue. It has resulted in regulations being enacted. However, I am unfamiliar with the details of the previous reg neg process for this specific issue, so I am unable to determine what, if any, problems were encountered previously that may indicate potential problems for another reg neg process. While a determination on whether or not to use reg neg this time around should not be made solely on the basis of the success or problems of the previous reg neg process, the current determination should take previous reg negs for airline disability access into consideration.

In deciding to utilize the reg neg process again, a key factor to examine is whether the potential members of an advisory committee can engage in the reg neg process with good faith. Committee members must possess a genuine interest in working collaboratively, hearing all sides of the issue, operating with honesty and transparency, and supporting statements and claims with verifiable facts and information.

Also, the reg neg process may require time and patience. Negotiations, particularly where participants are initially far from a consensus, require a back-and-forth process to be successful. Sometimes this back-and-forth can be tedious and time-extensive. The more that the back-and-forth can occur - meaning, the more time that is available for the negotiations - the higher the likelihood of the reg neg process resulting in success. As such, one factor to consider in whether to use the reg neg process, is the amount of time available for the process. This examination of available time must include the time that potential committee members have to commit to the process, the time the federal agency has available to allow the process, the time that is available according to available resources, such as money, that are needed to support the reg neg process, and the urgency of need for regulations to be enacted.

In conclusion, I wish to point out that technology and creative-thinking will assist in overcoming any logistic barriers to the reg neg process and will also allow for more diverse committee members, particularly in the case of committee members with disabilities (disabilities can include physical disabilities and mental disabilities). The reg neg process itself needs to be accessible to all stakeholders.",,,,,,,

I am writing today to share my support that PSDP (Psychiatric Service Dog Partners) represents my interest in the proposal negotiated rule making (docket DOT-OST-2015-0246).

PSDP is a peer advocacy group that represents myself and so many more that deal with mental illness, psychiatric disabilities daily, most for life.  Many take an active role in their recovery to lead a ""normal"" life by the use of a service dog. So that we might enjoy life day to day, as described by ADA.  

If it were not for PSDP, I'd be alone, in my home.  It was through finding this group, that allowed me to approach my Primary care Doctor and discuss my need for a service dog.  My Doctor and my therapist agree a service dog is required for my illness.  I have a letter.

I am 60 yrs. old, and have been disabled for many years. I use a Service dog for Mobility/Balance Assistance. I am on my third Service Dog now. My first two dogs were trained by me and because of my states law I had to have them tested and certified by a Service dog organization at that time.  By the time my current Service dog came along, my states laws had changed. I trained this dog as I did my first two, but since I no longer under Federal Law needed certification, I employed a trainer to test my present dog and make sure that she like my first two dogs was able to work in public and remain unobtrusive, and able to do the tasks I required of her. In addition to that I did some additional, but not required testing with my trainer. My present Service Dog , as my last two Service Dogs is a well mannered and focused dog. We are always welcome in places of business where we live and travel as well as Public Transportation, and Greyhound. My Service dog was recommended by my Doctors to help me with my Mobility issues. I have been around many Service dogs over the years. I have seen program trained dogs that were both good and bad.  I have also seen Owner Trained Service dogs who were good and bad.  Being an owner trainer myself. I want to stand up for those who have task trained Service Dogs they have trained themselves or with the help of a private trainer. This is not something that is easy to do. Like program dogs. Many hours of training go into these dogs. You don't just slap on a vest and go. It is more involved. It takes at least 18 mos. to 2 years to fully train a puppy from the ground up to be a Service Dog. It involves hard work on your part as well as the Dogs part. As an owner trainer, I am dedicated to presenting the public with a well behaved Service Dog. I keep my Service dogs training sharp for the working life of that Dog.  In recent years we have seen the increase of people who use Service Dogs and we have also seen the Emotional Support animals.
I believe that in regards to that later type of animal, I have seen too much that was ridiculous. But, the Air lines need to shoulder some of this blame for allowing untrained animals like Pigs, parrots, barking yapping unhousebroken dogs and cats, and finally that Turkey on an Air plane as an Emotional Support Animal. I am one who well knows the comfort an animal can bring. But that said I believe that only dogs and the miniature horses can and should be Service Animals. As for ESA's they should be completely done away with. Only task trained Service dogs and Psychiatric Service dogs should be allowed to fly. I don't believe a person needs to be forced to show any one their doctors letter in order to travel. Ones disability is their business. But that brings us to a need to separate the Fake service dogs from the real. I don't know how that can be done fairly. Id's aren't a good way because anyone can go on line and pay money and get a fake ID and vests. The airlines may have to set up a program within to stop these fakers. But please stop these things like Turkeys from flying. In setting up a program for Air travel and persons with disabilities who use a Service Dog Please do not exclude Owner Trainers, and the Psychiatric Service Dog community.

Over that time, data has shown that Truck Stop Electrification (""TSE"") significantly reduces fuel use, fuel costs, engine wear, and noise. The data and customer feedback confirmed that TSE is desirable and affordable, and the service earned many devoted customers.  The drawbacks:  too few TSE facilities to meet the need; limited truck parking spaces (which discouraged non-customers from leaving TSE parking spaces open for plug-in customers);  lack of driver awareness of the service; dependence on truck stop staff to promote the service; and lack of interest on the part of national truck fleets due to limited availability. 

Recently completed DOE-funded projects stimulated the economy by returning 250% of the original grant monies; reducing diesel fuel consumption and exhaust emissions; adding 66,268 FTE labor hours to the economy; and doubling the number of truck stop electrification sites in the nation.  The stimulus had a ripple effect within the trucking industry which continues. During the project period, major truck manufacturers such as Daimler-Freightliner began installing idle reduction equipment as standard on their production models.  The idle reduction equipment manufacturers (of APUs and eTRUs) increased their sales, improved their technology, set up brokers, and increased sales staff.  Fleets installed private electrification installations in their yards and staging areas.  

For more information, please see ""Interstate Electrification Improvement Project             Final Report."" 

Shore power is now a more common term in the trucking industry (and no longer only associated with marine vessels).  It is a well-known alternative power source thats cheaper than idling, and tangible not a concept or experiment. Industry spokespeople state its only a matter of time before shore power is available everywhere, and they see it coming. 

The current 115 TSE sites (both on-board and off-board technology) are an insufficient number to serve the long haul trucking industry and earn enough to support an enterprise without heavy education and outreach efforts.

Lack of open parking spaces next to power pedestals is a very significant barrier to TSE.  Users of crowded truck stops will not leave a space open for a customer because they may not get any other space otherwise.  Sites with consistent utilization always had adequate parking for overnight customers. Limited truck parking is a serious national problem that is challenging to solve, however, other options should be considered immediately including reserved paid parking at the power outlets; an idle-free zone at the connection points that is enforced; and parking priority given to major fleets and regular customers. Existing customers state they are willing to pay between $12 and $25 per night for a reserved space at a power pedestal.  

Any current or future highway funding or legislation should include concessions for Truck Stop Electrification infrastructure and encourage uptake through outreach and education campaigns.  Any new parking facilities should be required to install a minimum percentage of electrified parking spaces, allowing drivers to save fuel and emissions. 

It is estimated that there should be at least another 200 well-sited facilities to meet the operational needs of the truck drivers and fleets, and reach the critical mass needed to foster widespread adoption by large fleets.  Future study might determine the best strategy for expansion: 1) Concentrate sites on a very busy corridor and space them 100 to 150 miles apart, or 2) Space sites no more than 500 mile intervals on Interstates nationwide, along routes used by large trucking fleets.
