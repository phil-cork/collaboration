I have been a flight attendant at Sun Country Airlines for 16 years and I love working for a small carrier that flies many scheduled and charter flights.  Our company is excited at the opportunity to service Lansing MI and WA Reagan airport.  We are a small ""hometown"" carrier and we often service cities that are not serviced by many airlines.  Our passengers love that we come into their towns and fly non stop.  They love our airline - I hear frequently how they love Sun Country, we are nicer than the standard big carriers and they are thrilled that they don't have to drive far to get to major airports.  If we have the priviledge to fly from Lansing to WA Reagan, it will satisfy a need in the market, make many passengers happy, and provide additional jobs, revenue, and tourism to the Minneapolis, Lansing, and D.C. markets.

I would like to endorse Sun Country Airlines' application for landing slots at Reagan Airport.

The employees at Sun Country Airlines are not just cogs in a machine... we are a family. Each employee is an integral member in a superior product. Having worked for multiple airlines, I have never seen a company that cares so much about customer service, on time performance and overall customer satisfaction. Sun Country Airlines has provided and will continue to provide a level of customer satisfaction and a level of professionalism that you just will not find elsewhere. This company truly believes that the entire experience, not just the final product, be far past every customer's expectations. Every single employee cares about and supports the future of this company, and that will certainly show when given the chance to fly in and out of Washington Reagan International Airport. 

We are a hometown airline, and we come to the table with hometown values. Sun Country Airlines focuses on detail, and making sure that EVERYthing is complete, and completed beyond the customer's satisfaction level. We will stand up for the right thing, and will not back down. When a larger company tries to impress a potential client with the size and wealth of a company, they are simply redirecting focus from the dull side to the more shiny side. Sun Country Airlines simply shines all over. We have nothing to hide, and everything to show. We will in fact far exceed the expectations of the government, and will certainly make in impression; as we already have from the military charters we have accomplished.

In short, Sun Country Airlines will not just deliver what is agreed upon. We will far exceed the expectations, and will make people sit back and say, ""Wow!"" I believe in Sun Country Airlines, and you should too.",,,,,,,

RE: Docket OST-2000-7182

Dear Secretary LaHood:

This letter expresses support for the application of AirTran Airways Inc. for two available Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) slots being allocated in Docket OST-2000-7182 to provide nonstop service from Sarasota Bradenton International Airport (SRQ) to DCA.

The Sarasota Bradenton area has only one daily nonstop on a regional jet to Washington, DC, even though it is the sixth largest destination market from this area.  I personally commute to DC regularly to practice law in the United States Court of Federal Claims.

With over 750,000 residents and our prime location as a leisure destination for tourists, SRQ can certainly support additional service and it would be a great help to the
Tourism industry in this region, which suffered a significant impact from the BP oil spill.

This new service would also mitigate the negative economic impact the recession has had on the community and the airport.

We ask that the slots be awarded to AirTran for utilization to SRQ.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Anne Gore Maglio, Esq.",,,,,,,

This means no one locally can easily drop me off or pick me up at the airport, so I have to park my car at $10 a day, at the airport.  The cost of a round trip flight to Washington, DC varies greatly. It was over $600 earlier this year.  I've gone to DC four times this year, and considering the time it takes to get to the airport, waiting for the flight, etc. and the cost of the ticket, checked baggage and parking, I chose to drive for 3 of those trips.

I am the union representative for the Transport Workers of America local 545 and on behalf of our membership I would like to petition you for the award. These slots are important to any airline that are applying for them but to an airline of our size even more so. These slots would allow us to continue to expand our route structure and ultimately add more high paying jobs. In this difficult economy any chance to add jobs is worth taking the few minutes to put in this request on our behalf.  Sun Country Airlines has always had a fantastic relationship between labor and management one that has been built on mutual respect for each other with the ultimate goal of making our customers as satisfied as possible with there travel experience.

I am not clear as to why you require additional documentation for a psychiatric/Emotional support makes no sense...in order to qualify as a service dog, they must be trained for that individual disability.  Barnone.  I cannot control when I am getting an anxiety attack just like my friend has no control over his seizures or knows if they are going to have a diabetic issue.  Please modify the law accordingly.  Its a service animal.  Documentation should not be required and in order to be a service dog, THEY MUST BE TRAINED for that individual disability.  The way it reads now is discriminatory.  It is also giving leeway to people who really don't have service animals since the way it is written it states that emotional support dogs do not have to be trained which is not true at all and therefore would not qualify as service animals.",,,,,,,

I’m here to tell you that this isn’t the case.  I’ll present just a couple of many examples.  I have multiple sclerosis and my hands are frequently spastic and unable to handle change.  I requested that our transit provider allow people with disabilities to purchase reduced fare monthly pass-cards, as they do for students.  The request wasn’t outright denied but I received no response to my formal written requests and even speaking at City Hall failed to make this happen.  When the item was added to a class-action federal lawsuit that was joined by the Department of Justice, I was finally able to buy a card at the reduced fare (more than a year after the request).  Heretofore, I had to handle change each and every time I boarded a bus (difficult if not impossible with my lack of dexterity).

Here is another example.  Many like myself with multiple sclerosis are heat intolerant and suffer from extraordinary fatigue.  I asked our transit provider to allow the purchase of monthly fare cards at the downtown depot, where those cards are normally for sale.  They only sold those cards one month at a time, and only the last week of the month (for the following month).  My request was to buy at least three months in advance, so as to avoid unnecessary trips.  I was told yes, but it did not happen for more than a year.  Again, it took the Department of Justice’s intervention and a Consent Decree to get our transit provider to allow people to purchase several months worth of passes at one time.  What is so strange about this is that one would think that it behooves a company to sell services far in advance, since they keep the revenue!  It boggles the mind.",,,,,,,

First I want to share with you some background information about the transit system I represent.
	Established in 1974, LAKETRAN is the regional transit authority for Lake County, Ohio, serving the people of Lake County in a partly suburban, party rural setting operating local fixed routes, commuter express and paratransit service, also known as Dial-a-Ride which, notably,  provides door-to-door service.
	Operating an $11 million budget, nearly 66% is dedicated to Dial-a-Ride that serves 255,000 or approximately 1/3 of our riders. LAKETRAN has consistently provided paratransit service which exceeds minimum requirements of the ADA.
	For nearly 10 years, I have served as a member of the LAKETRAN Board of Trustees. During that time I have served as the Board’s Vice President and also its President. Most importantly, I am a “user” of the LAKETRAN system.
	Today, LAKETRAN – like many other transit systems – is at risk. Public transit systems are facing unprecedented funding challenges due to widespread declining state and local revenues, and have been forced to take a number of critical actions.
•	84 percent of public transit systems have raised fares, cut service or are
 considering these actions in their next budget cycles.
•	More than half are responding to the crisis by transferring funds from capital
 use to operating budgets, thus aggravating efforts to keep systems in a state of
 good repair.
•	As bad as the situation is now, more service cuts, fare increases, layoffs and
deferred capital projects will occur if this problem is not addressed.
	For small systems like LAKETRAN, the impact of the funding crisis is approaching catastrophic levels. In 2009, for the first time in LAKETRAN’s history, the Board of Trustees was forced to authorize service reductions and fare increases. It was a painful move; yet it was necessary and tantamount to placing this system on life support. Our situation has been replicated in transit systems across the country.
	I’m sure you are wondering what all of this has to do with the DOT NPRM currently under discussion. At LAKETRAN we are deeply concerned about the impact of DOT’s position on reasonable modifications, including mandating door-to-door service, in view of the serious transit funding crisis.
	As a person with a disability who is dependent upon public transit, I understand the disability community’s desire for “reasonable modifications” to be recognized. However, as a LAKETRAN trustee, I juxtapose that desire with the reality of the economic environment in which we are currently operating.
	My greatest concern is that a mandate by the Department to provide “reasonable
modifications” for passengers with disabilities will place in greater jeopardy the vital
paratransit services we are desperately trying to preserve.
	With no end in sight to the nightmare of the transit funding crisis, and the devastating nationwide loss of paratransit service which threatens to worsen, I question the rationality of the basic tenet of “reasonable modification” – as a regulation – in the context of ADA paratransit without a full understanding of the economics and financial implications based upon the inherent modifications to systems’ service delivery which would result. At LAKETRAN, we are aware of this every day as we struggle to continue to provide door-to-door service. A legal mandate to provide service with additional “reasonable modifications” could be devastating.

The following examples are illustrative:
•	LAKETRAN has been requested but cannot modify its service to remain with a
 passenger who, due to her disability, cannot be left alone without an attendant
 upon reaching her destination. To require this would either ultimately eliminate
 the concept of shared rides, or force LAKETRAN to hire attendants to stay with
 passengers who require that extra measure of attention. Either way, costs   
 would increase in terms of the need to hire additional employees, pay for  
 additional fuel and/or buses in the event shared ride service can no longer be   
 offered.
•	Requiring door-to-door service is not simple. Moreover, it inherently creates
 potential risks for our drivers. It is also relative to the overall costs of paying for
 the service. Occupational health and safety regulations, increased liability and
 workman’s compensation insurance must be considered when a system
 undertakes door-to-door service. The challenges as well as the costs imposed  
 in transporting a passenger across a snow and ice covered gravel drive to his  
 door cannot be forgotten.

	Presupposing the obligation for door-to-door service is already in the regulation, and failing to review the costs associated with it, creates a great disservice that threatens service for everyone. Until the Department studies the costs, it cannot state whether they are significant or not.
	Transit systems exist to provide rides to all of our passengers, including those with disabilities. It is not transit systems’ desire to cut service, particularly for the populations who are most dependent upon them. I respectfully ask you to carefully consider the unintended consequences this regulation will create. I encourage you to explore the economic and financial impact of a regulatory application of “reasonable modification” including the subsequent impact on the nation’s transit systems’ continued ability to deliver the service the disability community requires.
	The most important role the DOT can play is in creating an environment in which a proper dialogue can occur between DOT, the disability community and the transit systems to determine how best to deliver service modifications and – most importantly – how to pay for them. I strongly recommend that you immediately institute a dialogue to identify in a reasonable way those things our riders need and allow a reasonable latitude to meet not only minimum ADA requirements but also to consider the individual passengers’ reasonable needs.

	It is imperative for all of us and incumbent upon each of us to prevent further loss of this vital service.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2006-23985-0356/attachment_1.pdf",

Re: 	Comments on Docket number OST–2006–23985

On an almost daily basis, I and many of my fellow ADAPT of Texas members who are also fulltime wheelchair users continue to experience discriminatory treatment by transportation providers that receive public funds.

On publicly funded BUSES:
•	Drivers and other personnel should not only be trained to, but also tested on, proficiency with regard to assisting with boarding and deboarding persons who use wheelchairs.  Too many times we have heard the excuse that the access equipment does not work when it is actually “operator error” causing the problem.  This has resulted in our people being left behind to wait for another bus while non-disabled passengers are allowed to travel.
•	A clear policy regarding priority boarding of passengers with disabilities should be established.  Many times, especially during peak hours, bus ridership approaches capacity loads.  But when persons with wheelchairs (or other disabilities) are left to board to board last, there is often no room left according to the driver.  But when passengers with disabilities are allowed to board first, any remaining passengers seem to have no problem squeezing in to fill remaining space.
•	Public buses should ALWAYS be required to reposition for boarding and deboarding passengers with disabilities at inaccessible bus stops until ALL public bus stops are made accessible.
•	No more new bus stops should be placed or built that are inaccessible. Even though this is already a legal requirement, it is still not a common practice. Entities that continue to build inaccessible bus stops should be penalized.

On publicly funded TRAINS:
•	Railroad tracks that intersect or cross over roadways and/or sidewalks should always provide for an accessible route for persons using wheelchairs.
•	All train platforms should be made accessible to persons who use wheelchairs.
Too many times, we have been asked by AMTRAK to ride to the next station because of no access.
•	Until all platforms are accessible, bridge plates, lifts or other assistive devices should ALWAYS be readily available (ie. NEVER locked away, in storage, etc.) to any train personnel to provide assistance in boarding and deboarding passengers using wheelchairs.
•	Train conductors and other personnel should not only be trained to, but also tested on, proficiency with regard to assisting with boarding and deboarding persons who use wheelchairs.

And finally, even though not specifically on this docket, Greyhound and other over-the-road bus service providers should not be allowed any extension beyond the current deadlines (2012 for Greyhound) for the requirement to have wheelchair lifts on their entire fleet and to have a minimum of two wheelchair securement areas (that actually function as such) for passengers who use wheelchairs. Again, training to proficiency with mandatory testing should be a minimum standard.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2006-23985-0362/attachment_1.doc",

MOST ADA paratransit eligibility applications, there's a question about whether or not the applicant can wait 10 or 15 minutes for a fixed route bus without a bench or a shelter. If applicants can not, they are made paratransit eligible. It is inconsistent to say that this condition confers eligibility and then to require the same individuals to wait 30 minutes at the curb during the on-time window that is usually applied in ADA paratransit for a vehicle to arrive.

Docket number (OST-2006-23985DOT
Docket ID Number OST–2006–23985)

As co-chairs of the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities’ Transportation Task Force, we would like to reiterate our support for the comments that were submitted four years ago in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Docket ID Number OST–2006–23985).  The Department of Transportation (DOT) is doing the correct thing in attempting to clarify the issues of reasonable modifications to policies and procedures for transit providers and technical specifications for rail platforms aimed at achieving level boarding.

Given the tone and tenor of the docket comments and the discussion during the August 20th DOT open meeting, we feel it necessary to clarify a few key points of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that were debated and codified into law 20 years ago.

Access for people with disabilities is a civil right and is not dependent upon whether an individual entity feels financially able to provide that access.  However, this is coupled with the concept of reasonableness which has been legally and experientially shown to provide the balance needed so that entities do not experience an undue burden.  The ADA does not aim to create a “flat earth” but merely the greatest level of access that is technically feasible.  It aims to encourage flexibility and reasonable responsiveness to individual need.  The NPRM is in line with these standards. Finally, it is critical that the DOT release clear and decisive guidance in a timely manner.  Without this needed clarity, too often access and mobility are dependent on the goodwill or interpretation of the transit provider or individual operator.  This creates inequality for people with disabilities seeking to travel in their community.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment again on this important issue.

On the occasiion of The Americans with Dissabilities Act 20th anniversary,it is imperative that all Americans know that Transportation plays  both a vital and crucial role in lives of citizens with disabilities in rural America.

NCILS supports level platform boarding on AMTRACK. We also support policies that will make transit more acceessible to all.This applies not only when passengers boardand deboard vehicles.but how many recieve information,conduct business and interact with transit agencies.Alternative communication and formats should be utilizedat all times where possibleBraille,and use of Design systems that all allow forDeaf citizens to accees information.

We also support DOT reexamination of the definition of acommon wheelchair. Many of the mobility devices utilized today could go beyond thst that definition.

In regards to common practices and policies that nany transit agencies adopt.NCILS hopes that transit agecies adopt policies which would complete the accessible transit experiece,accounting for inaccessible terrain when parking or stopping,notiying customers through alternative means via phone or door bell  when a vehicle is present and not charging customers different fare rates when that service happens. are a few examples

Training and coordination should be a priority for empmployees of transit agecies. People with disabilities should be include in all aspects of transit planning and policy.",,,,,,,

Additionally, we believe the proposed changes lack adequate definition and may, in fact, exceed DOT’s rulemaking authority.The proposed regulatory changes have substantial direct compliance costs. The proposed requirement to provide door-to-door service could make it extremely difficult for a transit agency to efficiently combine paratransit trips, leading to greatly expanded vehicle inventories and a need for many more drivers to operate those vehicles. 
 
The proposed regulatory changes are not required by statute. Existing practices in paratransit services and commuter rail boarding have been in place for the entire life of the ADA and the DOT program. To proclaim, after 15 years of acceptance of the practices of transit agencies carefully overseen by the FTA, that the statute requires these modifications undermines the partnerships and good working relationships that have developed at the local level and provide millions of persons with disabilities transit accessibility, often beyond the level of service required by the ADA. 

Community Transit agrees with the concept of reasonable modification but the manner in which DOT seeks to address it is flawed. DOT should acknowledge that the concept of additional reasonable modification, beyond the accommodations prescribed in the current DOT regulations, represents a significant change from the historical requirements under the ADA as interpreted by DOT in its regulations and practices; that transit agencies already accomplish necessary or appropriate alterations of their service through local processes with FTA oversight; that full, immediate implementation by transit providers would be cost-prohibitive; and that a well-reasoned, properly funded approach based on the consensus views of transit providers and their paratransit riders would lead to better service for those riders.

This proposal represents a substantial change in long established paratransit practices.  General consensus  and practice have always been that ADA Paratransit requirements served as the reasonable accommodations to public transportation services.  Melton v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) considered the issue after appropriate briefing and argument. The Melton court found it undisputed that DART was exempt from the DOJ regulations finding, inter alia, that paratransit services are, in and of themselves, a reasonable modification.  Additionally, FTA reviewed and approved the paratransit plan at issue in the Melton case as it has so many others that never provided for reasonable modification, 
as defined by DOT in the NPRM, as a departure from the plan. The DOT proposal to graft reasonable modification onto the DOT regulations is a significant change from long established practice.

Additionally, requests for accommodations beyond mere alteration of pick-up and drop-off points may well include request for alternative fare media, exclusive trips, reduced scheduling windows, extended wait times to accommodate meals or restroom use immediately prior to boarding, entry into private streets or complexes, or ‘dog-free’ vehicles. Providing these accommodations would entail enormous cost increases. 

 Implementation of just one aspect of reasonable modification, door-to-door service, would add substantial costs for many transit agencies by limiting agencies’ ability to employ shared rides. Drivers cannot be expected to routinely leave running vehicles with other riders, even for short periods without risking injury to those other riders or theft of paratransit vehicles. A driver assisting a rider to his door would not be able to safely respond to an incident at the vehicle without abandoning the client in his or her immediate care. The alternative, turning off the vehicle with other passengers on board, is equally unacceptable. Even assuming the most flexible interpretation by FTA, consistent door-to-door service cannot be provided without additional costs.

 APTA believes the basic choice of curb-to-curb service vis-à-vis door-to-door service should remain a local choice with transit providers providing individualized enhancements or alternatives on an exception basis as locally practical and affordable. The alternative expressed in this rulemaking would reverse that process and make the exception the rule. This change would require transit providers to shift substantial resources from other operations to their paratransit programs to fund programs of reasonable modifications. This shift of operational funding would threaten some agencies’ ability to maintain existing levels of service in the future. Moreover, although DOT does not agree with the result in the Melton case, it should note carefully that, before litigating this matter in the courts, the Melton plaintiff asked for an accommodation, the transit agency considered the request, and determined it was essentially unsafe. Although the plaintiff chose not to utilize the FTA review process, FTA had reviewed a case described by the Melton court as “factually similar” and FTA agreed with the transit agency. The system works and works well.

APTA fully supports the intent of proposed change to 49 CFR 37.23, to ensure operations not be shifted to the private sector to avoid ADA requirements. We believe, however, that the language as drafted may have the unintended effect of interfering with transit agencies’ ability to support non-traditional, private programs that give riders with and without disabilities greater options. Community Transit supports, as part of a broad coalition of human service providers, schools and transit, a number of innovative programs.  We recommend DOT carefully review the proposed rule to ensure it does not inadvertently foreclose community outreach and support programs such as these.   With passage of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act – A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) and the advent of the New Freedom program (providing for new service enhancements and improvements beyond those required by the ADA), communities will be better equipped to provide enhanced transportation services to riders with disabilities without etracting from existing accessible services. One of the most important aspects will be the continued ability of transit providers to tailor these enhancements, often beyond the scope of ADA paratransit, to the needs and desires of their riders. In lieu of blanket requirements that fundamentally and adversely impact our transit systems and passengers, DOT should provide leadership to foster freedom, choice, mobility, and independence for persons with disabilities by encouraging transit agencies and the disability community to continue to work together to pursue those goals for the benefit of all riders and by supporting the New Freedom program. 

The notice seeks input on accessibility standards to be applied to Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems, including BRT vehicles. APTA believes BRT systems and vehicles must be accessible but that no single set of standards can be applied to the broad range of systems and equipment used in BRT. 

Although some BRT vehicles are designed and operated more like light rail vehicles than typical transit buses, many BRT systems employ equipment and bus stops typical of normal bus service. These fundamental differences in systems that fall under the BRT umbrella defy application of a single set of standards. Instead, system operators should look to the characteristics of their particular system in deciding how best to make it accessible. The Department’s Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations should be updated to establish this standard.

Regarding Vehicles for Demand Responsive Service, since accessibility of demand responsive services are viewed in their entirety (i.e., the service, not individual vehicles, must be accessible) under the provisions of 49 CFR 37.77, vehicle acquisition practices should reflect that viewpoint. There is no need for a separate used vehicle provision. Standards for obtaining used vehicles should mirror those for obtaining new vehicles. 

 Regarding Treatment of Segways and Other Non-Standard Mobility Devices, standardized, predictable envelope sizes and weights are crucial to universal accessibility. Deviations from the standards without careful analysis and planning risk significant injury to riders with disabilities, other passengers, and transit employees. We believe that in lieu of attempting to accommodate changes to mobility devices independently, the Department should defer to the Access Board in defining the envelope and weight standards applicable to wheelchairs and other mobility devices. Regarding Segways, in particular, we do not believe they are safe to transport.  Additionally, if  transit operators are required to allow them on board, there is no guarantee that the rider can take their Segway onto the public streets or sidewalks at their destination since use of the devices is outlawed in some places. DOT should refrain from attempting to dictate changes to mobility device standards without reference to the Access Board. Finally, no changes to the standards should be attempted through guidance. All changes should follow the formal rulemaking process. 

 APTA strongly disagrees with the Department’s proposal to alter the existing methodology for counting missed paratransit trips. We are aware of no data that would suggest that current methods of determining capacity constraints are not effective in detecting them. They have worked for 15 years and absent a problem that is not articulated in the Department's argument, there is no need for change. 

 Although we agree with the Department that each leg of a trip should be considered as a ""trip"" for purposes of the trip denial and missed trip provisions of the regulations, we believe the practice of counting denial of one leg of a journey as two missed trips because the rider will not or can not procure alternate transportation for the denied leg is inappropriate. We believe this proposal would nnecessarily skew the data based on the availability and affordability of alternatives. Moreover, double counting reflects the reaction to partial unavailability, not the actual level of service available. Finally, the double counting system could really lead to triple counting if the rider wanted to go from home to physician to pharmacy to home, further blurring the actual service availability measure. 

 We believe counting more then the actual denied trip would also complicate record keeping by forcing grantees to alter their reservation systems. Many trips on paratransit are one-way but depending on how the reservation system works on the system, one might never know it. This is because of the expansion of alternative public and private transit opportunities for persons with disabilities, greater accessibility of the fixed route, reduced or free fares on fixed route and expansion of trip-by-trip eligibility of paratransit riders. The capacity of the paratransit system is therefore best measured by 
treating each leg separately. However, the Department's conclusion that when one leg of a round trip is denied, then two denials should automatically be counted flies directly in the face of the individual-leg-as-a-trip concept the Department purports to embrace and would significantly distort the resulting data because those numbers would no longer be a true measure of the capacity of the system.",,,,,,,

As an example United Airlines was alerted of American Airline's plans to charge checked baggage fees on April 28, 2008 [1]; it matched this fee effective June 13, 2008 [2], i.e. in less than 7 weeks.  In this time it developed the complex systems required to handle cash and credit card payments, upgraded thousand of self service check-in kiosks, and implemented complex business rules in determining whether a fee should be charged (was the ticket purchased before the fee went into effect? is the passenger traveling internationally? is the passenger elite? etc.)

In contrast to the complexity of baggage fee implementation, the DOT's requirements are fulfilled by the modification of a single system (web) to display additional static information; the timeframe to do so is almost double than what the complex implementation of baggage fees required.

Given the precedent of developing and implementing far more complex systems in far less time than what required by 74 FR 68983, from at least one of the ATA's members, I urge the DOT to reject the wholesale request of the ATA and consider individual airline applications as required, establishing a burden of proof comparing fulfilling the DOT requirements with bag fee implementation.

Airlines have repeatedly locked passengers in planes with no food or water and fouled toilet facilities; they have never shown any concern for these conditions or made any effort to find workable solutions to these extremes.  In short, the airlines refuse to accept any responsibility, which is why Congress had to act.

The current request, to exempt all airlines from such regulations at JFK and adjacent airports due to runway construction, is a blatant attempt to avoid the regulations and, more crucially, an attempt to set a precedent to be used for all such runway construction projects going forward.  In effect, they want to eviscerate the regulations; the airlines continue to show no understanding of the abysmal conditions they create or the suffering of passengers. 

The DOT should deny the entire request from all airlines.  Further, the DOT should have the FCC direct  the airlines to work out schedule changes, including larger but fewer planes, that will alleviate possible delays caused by runway construction.

The deplaning option was intended to offer relief to passengers from long tarmac delays during “irregular operations” resulting from occasional weather and other problems. Here, the airlines are seeking regulatory relief from the consequences of their chronic overscheduling of daily flights in excess of available runway capacity.
As a commercial pilot with 20 years experience I KNOW that when airport capacity is temporarily reduced because of the on-going reconstruction of a runway at an airport, scheduled airline operations must be reduced and the average size of serving aircraft increased, etc., to reflect the reduced capacity of the available runway system(s). Here the airlines serving the New York area-Philadelphia airports want regulatory relief from the competitive consequences of their chronic overscheduling of flights at JFK during the months a major runway there is closed for reconstruction. This is a different issue than protecting passengers from the rare strandings on airline aircraft for extended periods of time because of occasionally bad weather or failures of an airline’s internal staffing or management systems.
DOT Secretary LaHood’s granting these airline exemptions from the three-hour rule would set a bad precedent. In just one month a single airline’s request for permission to keep its passengers stranded on taxiways for unlimited

This is an attempt of several airlines to legitimize the act of holding passengers against their will simply for the airlines convenience and  for maximizing profits. No businesses should be allowed to operate above the law and no companies should be given greater rights then individuals. I do not agree that any company should be given a blanket permission to hold me as a passenger against my will. This would be viewed as a precedent and used to excuse any other outrageous behavior by businesses motivated solely by profit.

I believe that this request for exemption of the five airlines stems from the reckless, narrow-minded, and obnoxious attitude of the airlines' leadership toward their passengers. Let's not forget that these are the passengers that pay your six figure salaries.

Before considering this request I would like to remind of a recent history: We all saw how the auto industry spent millions of dollars into lobbying against fuel efficiency regulations citing reduced safety and consumer choices only to find out a year later that american cars have become less competitive and fallen behind the market trends.  The EU-US Open Skies Agreement allows for greater competition from EU airlines, which already pay fines for tarmac delays. Allowing US airlines to keep their heads in the sand instead of making them work on their chronic problems will make them less appealing to passengers and ultimately less competitive. Their request for exemption is unfounded!",,,,,,,

I am writing in response to the request by several air carriers for an exemption from the so-called tarmac delay rules at several of the nation's busiest airports (JFK, LGA, EWR and PHL) while construction is completed at one of JFK's runways.

As a frequent passenger from three of these airports, I am adamantly opposed to the airlines' request.  Requiring the airlines to treat passengers with dignity and respect should not be optional, nor should there be a temporary exemption from this requirement.  The claim that the disruptions to flight schedules necessitates the temporary exemption is perverse.  Indeed, the anticipated disruptions should require the airlines to develop meaningful contingency plans to prevent inordinate delays -- not provide an excuse for an exemption.  

Only extraordinary, unanticipated circumstances should result in relief from the requirement, and the rule already provides for relief in such circumstances.  If the airlines have failed to adjust their schedules adequately to deal with the runway construction, passengers should not be forced to suffer the consequences of this poor planning.  To be blunt, we've suffered enough and for long enough from their failures to plan.     

Contrary to the airlines' claims about treatment of passengers, the sad truth is that the flying public is too often treated no better than our baggage.  Indeed, for many of us, the situation is so bad that we now fly only when it is absolutely necessary.  Like many of my colleagues, I will frequently choose to drive six or more hours to avoid having to take a one-hour flight from the New York area.  That is surely not in anyone's interest, least of all the airlines.    

I believe the DOT's new requirements will mark the first step in what I hope will be a significant improvement in the quality of life for the flying public.  I commend you for implementing the rules, and I implore you to resist this spurious claim for an exemption.",,,,,,,

I have no objection to the exemption as it applies to JFK, EWR, and LGA, but PHL should not be part of the exemption.
The problem for US Airwarys at PHL is the overscheduling of flights and failure to get its planes in on time and turned around to go back out -- or its decisions to cancel partially full flights to create one overbooked flight to save money.  US Airways needs to evaluate its schedule and plan only those flights it knows it can get off the ground.

Holding someone against their will is a criminal offense in most places, except an airplane.  I have sat on the tarmac in PHL on US Air flights for three hours because of nothing more than too much traffic to get the flights up in the air.  They load everyone on the planes, get them away from the gate and send you into the Limbo of the holding areas until they can get cleared for takeoff.  

I see this merely as an excuse by US Air to avoid inevitable fines as a result of their business practices.  It is very interesting to note that no other carrier has requested an exemption for PHL.  Southwest now operates almost as many flights daily as US Air from PHL, yet has a fantastic on-time record.  The problem is not the airspace.  It is the airline.  

Do not grant US Airways an exemption for Philadelphia International Airport. 

Thank you.",,,,,,,

And they have availed themselves generously of the privilege.

Sometimes, the airlines can't help it, as in the case of inclement weather. In vastly more cases, however, these imprisonments are the result of the airlines own mismanagement of their and the FAA's resources, scheduling far more flights than can be handled by the air traffic control system. The stampede to more, smaller aircraft has exacerbated the problem, as a commercial jetliner uses the same airport and airspace resources whether it’s carrying 50 passengers or 500.

Congress has said, ""No more."" 

Now the airlines are claiming that they need to be exempted from this Federal Law, presumably because they have no intention of modifying their behavior.

Enough. 

There are plenty of ways the airlines can modify their business practices to accommodate the Law. Bigger, fewer airplanes. More flights during off-peak times. Abandoning routes. 

They could even try complying with the Law...

There will always be plenty of passengers requiring air transportation, and they will fly on the flights offered by the airlines. People need to go where they need to go, and will fly on the flights offered, even if those flights aren't at some preferred time. The airlines are not going to suffer economic disaster if they obey the rule.

Please deny their request for an exemption at JFK and, along with that denial, deny their requests for LGA, EWR, and PHL.

The deplaning option was intended to offer relief to passengers from long tarmac delays during “irregular operations” resulting from occasional weather and other problems. Here, the airlines are seeking regulatory relief from the consequences of their chronic overscheduling of daily flights in excess of available runway capacity.
As a commercial pilot with 20 years experience I know that when airport capacity is temporarily reduced because of the on-going reconstruction of a runway at an airport, scheduled airline operations must be reduced and the average size of serving aircraft increased, etc., to reflect the reduced capacity of the available runway system(s). Here the airlines serving the New York area-Philadelphia airports want regulatory relief from the competitive consequences of their chronic overscheduling of flights at JFK during the months a major runway there is closed for reconstruction. This is a different issue than protecting passengers from the rare strandings on airline aircraft for extended periods of time because of occasionally bad weather or failures of an airline’s internal staffing or management systems.
DOT Secretary LaHood’s granting these airline exemptions from the three-hour rule would set a bad precedent. In just one month a single airline’s request for permission to keep its passengers stranded on taxiways for unlimited
similarly situated carriers” serving JFK. On March 12, American Airlines supported JetBlue and Delta’s requests provided that relief would be extended to “all carriers operating at JFK, not just JetBlue and Delta.”",,,,,,,

There will ALWAYS - ALWAYS -  be reasons for delay in implementation (construction is an ongoing effort at all airports). There simple has GOT to be a stop to what amounts to little more than entrapment of passengers who - when we sit on tarmacs beyond 3 hours, especially on short flights  - have often lost any rationale for going in the first place (funeral missed, connections missed, wedding missed, meetings missed, tour missed, etc.) One of the elements that gets lost in all the arguments over this bill is the aggregate expense to thousands of passengers who, when they've missed whatever the point of the travel was, simply have to get a hotel, turn around and go home in the morning.The last time it happened to me - on a United flight that most passengers BEGGED to be let off of after 3.5 hours - it cost me in excess of $2,000 including forfeited fees, bookings forgone, return trip. hotel & meals. United simply wouldn't let us off that little commuter plane and just go home! Multiply this by thousands and you will see it from the passenger's point of view. I am absolutely convinced that most of the time the air carriers know damn well that there is going to be a lengthly delay before they ever leave the gate. There has GOT to be a better way to queue outgoing flights to the same destination than to stack them for hours on a runway. Forget the ""exemption requests"". These will lead to ""blanket exemption requests"", ""busy airport exemption requests"", ""frequent weather exemption requests"", etc. etc. It drills a big hole straight through a simple rule .... 3 hours, max! It's a good rule. Stick with it!!!!",,,,,,,

The airlines may reduce the number of flights at these airports during the construction period. This request for exemption is the first step down a slippery slope that would eventually result in the airlines being allowed to schedule too many flights at all the U.S. airports that they serve - a practice that currently increases their revenue at the expense of passengers.

Excessive delays aboard commercial aircraft can cause the passengers to suffer a medical condition called deep vein thrombosis, which occurs when there is little or no muscular contraction of the calves for an extended period. The three hour rule is adequate to prevent most cases of this condition. A person who is stricken with this condition, which there will be many more of if the airlines are granted this exception, is required to go on a regimen of a blood thinning medicine called coumadin for six months after the blood clot forms. The medicine must be injected by the patient twice a day, which is painful and inconvenient. By the way, it's a big hypodermic needle that delivers the injection. The medicine is expensive and reacts with many other medicines, requiring patients and their doctors to scramble to find replacement medicines for any other medical conditions they may be dealing with.

All things considered, airline passenger's health is more important than airline profit. It is my hope that the three hour rule will not be exempted, not for a temporary period, and not for a temporary period that turns into a permanent period. Airlines need to provide a service to their passengers that keeps them comfortable, not their shareholders.",,,,,,,

That is not to say that routing an aircraft is the same as routine a bus but the procedures are very similar.  You measure the capacity of the terminal (bus terminal and airport respectively) and then schedule vehicles commensurate with that capacity.

It would be intolerable, if after boarding a bus the doors were locked, the bus backed away from the terminal, and then sat in the parking lot for hours on end because the road is jammed with traffic.  Passengers would be allowed to disembark before toilets overflowed, drinking water was unavailable, and people ran out of food.  It should be no different for airlines.  The fact that the traveling public is willing to tolerate a 3 hour wait before disembarking is already a concession to the airlines which no bus company would be granted.

Over-scheduling flights is not a process the travelling public must accommodate.  If the airlines find that it is too expensive to return an aircraft to the gate then they need to rethink the schedule.  

Please do not allow any exception to the 3 hour rule as currently stated in the docket.  The DOT needs to draw a line in the sand between airline profits and flyer’s right to deplane without penalty when the service is completely inadequate.

  In view of the fact that the American public is overwhelmingly in favor of the recently passed legislation I can see no point in responding to the airlines attempts to find loopholes through which to escape.  It has been totally expected and probably will not be the last effort to get around compliance.
   They have options.  They can schedule fewer flights, fly different aircraft or cancel flights.  None of these options result in members of the public being held hostage aboard an airplane for over 3 hours.  As a frequent flyer for many years I can tell you that I would much prefer my flight being cancelled to sitting onboard for hours.
  As a person with a heart condition I can also tell you that hours long onboard delay has been a fear in the back of my mind for years.  The most recent stranding in Rochester, MN was too close for comfort and I am determined to do whatever I can to help raise the public's awareness of the need for this legislation to remain intact.
  Thank you for your consideration of my views.

Carrier Temp Exemption from DOT Tarmac Delay rules for JFK, LWR, PHL is UNREASONABLE and defeats the purpose for the legislation. It leaves passengers unprotected and allows airlines  to continue to OVERSCHEDULE beyond the capacity of the airport.    The airlines would rather risk stranding passengers for over three hours on grounded planes rather than scheduling in a  way that is sensible for the resources available. 

This is a play to evade responsibility.   DOT has existing regulatory authority to consider mitigating factors in deciding whether (a) to pursue an enforcement case where there is a violation of the 3-hour rule; and (b) to negotiate the amount of the civil penalty, and, thus, no BLANKET exemptions should be granted. A BLANKET exemption  is a bad idea and leaves airlines with no disincentive to stranding passengers if  it suits their interests to leave the plane on the runway.

In the public's interest,  I  urge you to NOT allow this temporary exemption, esp in so broad a manner.",,,,,,,

It is incredible that the airlines have been allowed to justify holding passengers hostage against their will in inhumane conditions that would be in clear violation of EPA standards and probably even in violation of the standards most prisons are held to for care of prisoners. Being held hostage without food, clean restrooms, and clean air for any longer than 3 hours is outrageous and should no longer be tolerated.

If the airlines are competent in doing their jobs, they should be able to adjust their schedules to accomodate the known delays in the Greater New York airspace due to JFK runway construction. Any other delays are caused by the airlines own scheduling practices and should definitely be no cause for any waiver consideration.

In summary: Absolutely NO to carriers ""temporary"" exemption requests from DOT's Tarmac Delay Rules.",,,,,,,

This is a problem not endemic to the geographic location but to the greed of airlines who over pack east coast airports.  A US flight is typically 2 to 5 hours long.

Less would not be considered to extreme for a domestic animal.

Re:       Docket No. DOT-OST-2007-0022
 Comments on Carriers’ Temporary Exemption Requests from DOT’s Tarmac Delay Rules for JFK, EWR, LGA, and PHL Operations
 Ladies and Gentlemen:
We the undersigned member of the largest non-profit national  airline passenger  rights organization  representing 28,000  consumers in the United States wish to have our views considered in response to DOT Secretary LaHood’s recent request for public comments on the successive petitions of JetBlue, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Continental Airlines, and US Airways to free all airlines serving all three major New York area airports and the Philadelphia International Airport from the “maximum three-hour stranding limit” during the months when a major runway at John F. Kennedy International Airport is necessarily closed for reconstruction.
 First, we congratulate Secretary LaHood for adopting such a 3-hour rule in DOT’s recently-adopted passenger protection regulation so as to limit the amount of time that airline passengers can be stranded on airport tarmacs without an option to deplane, if such can be done safety and securely.  We have supported enactment of the similar “Airline Passengers Bill of Rights” provisions in S. 1586, as recently passed the Senate, and soon to be considered in the House-Senate Conference on the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2010.
 We believe DOT should deny the airlines’ petitions for many reasons:
  (1) It appears that the airlines are trying to get exempted from the 3-hour strandings limit at four major airports so that they can continue overscheduling flights beyond the temporarily reduced capacity of JFK’s runway system without any penalty.  We understand the JFK runway reconstruction program has been long planned, and believe the airlines should have better adjusted their operations to conform to JFK’s somewhat-reduced runway capacity for these few months.
(2) Airline passengers now understand that they have a new right not to be stranded on airline aircraft for many hours without any recourse.  If DOT were to approve these extraordinary airline requests – even before the new regulation is effective later this month – it would allow all airlines to impose strandings without any maximum time limit on millions of passengers who will be using these major East Coast airports in coming months; and
(3) In our view, the preferable solution would be for Secretary LaHood to instruct the Federal Aviation Administration to convene an early meeting of the airlines serving JFK and to require that they modify their “overscheduled” operations to conform to the currently available airport capacity so that passengers need not be stranded for hours on taxiways.
We agree with the views in the March 26 letter of Senators Boxer and Snowe to Secretary LaHood on this topic.  More specifically, we have reviewed the detailed comments being submitted to this docket this week by FlyersRights.org and support the analysis and recommendations of this airline passenger advocacy group. 
 Thank you for considering our views on this important consumer issue.  
 Sincerely, 
Steven Kelly

Re:       Docket No. DOT-OST-2007-0022
 Comments on Carriers’ Temporary Exemption Requests from DOT’s Tarmac Delay Rules for JFK, EWR, LGA, and PHL Operations
 Ladies and Gentlemen:
We the undersigned member of the largest non-profit national  airline passenger  rights organization  representing 28,000  consumers in the United States wish to have our views considered in response to DOT Secretary LaHood’s recent request for public comments on the successive petitions of JetBlue, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Continental Airlines, and US Airways to free all airlines serving all three major New York area airports and the Philadelphia International Airport from the “maximum three-hour stranding limit” during the months when a major runway at John F. Kennedy International Airport is necessarily closed for reconstruction.
 First, we congratulate Secretary LaHood for adopting such a 3-hour rule in DOT’s recently-adopted passenger protection regulation so as to limit the amount of time that airline passengers can be stranded on airport tarmacs without an option to deplane, if such can be done safety and securely.  We have supported enactment of the similar “Airline Passengers Bill of Rights” provisions in S. 1586, as recently passed the Senate, and soon to be considered in the House-Senate Conference on the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2010.
 We believe DOT should deny the airlines’ petitions for many reasons:
  (1) It appears that the airlines are trying to get exempted from the 3-hour strandings limit at four major airports so that they can continue overscheduling flights beyond the temporarily reduced capacity of JFK’s runway system without any penalty.  We understand the JFK runway reconstruction program has been long planned, and believe the airlines should have better adjusted their operations to conform to JFK’s somewhat-reduced runway capacity for these few months.
(2) Airline passengers now understand that they have a new right not to be stranded on airline aircraft for many hours without any recourse.  If DOT were to approve these extraordinary airline requests – even before the new regulation is effective later this month – it would allow all airlines to impose strandings without any maximum time limit on millions of passengers who will be using these major East Coast airports in coming months; and
(3) In our view, the preferable solution would be for Secretary LaHood to instruct the Federal Aviation Administration to convene an early meeting of the airlines serving JFK and to require that they modify their “overscheduled” operations to conform to the currently available airport capacity so that passengers need not be stranded for hours on taxiways.
We agree with the views in the March 26 letter of Senators Boxer and Snowe to Secretary LaHood on this topic.  More specifically, we have reviewed the detailed comments being submitted to this docket this week by FlyersRights.org and support the analysis and recommendations of this airline passenger advocacy group. 
 Thank you for considering our views on this important consumer issue.  
 Sincerely,

For more than a decade, the industry has fought efforts to force decent treatment of fliers, especially when planes are stranded.
In 1999, the airlines lobbied to kill a congressional measure to regulate consumer services. In 2007, the industry challenged a New York law that would have forced airlines to provide food, water and working restrooms to fliers stuck on tarmacs in that state. (Imagine the nerve, telling airlines they can't starve customers!) The law was overturned.
And now that a new federal rule will soon require airlines to let passengers get off planes after three hours of delay, some airlines are trying to wriggle out of complying.
American, Delta and JetBlue have asked for an exemption at Kennedy International, one of the most crowded and delay-prone airports in the nation, while a runway is closed for reconstruction. Continental has gone further, seeking exemptions at the other two major New York airports (LaGuardia and Newark Liberty). CEO Jeff Smisek called the new rule ""stupid"" and ""inane"" and warned of more cancellations as flights run up against the three-hour rule.
It sounds like a bully's schoolyard threat: Mess with me and I'll cancel more flights.
Fact is, the new rule — which takes effect April 29 — isn't as inflexible as the industry portrays it. There are exceptions to preserve safety and security in bad weather and to avoid disruption of airport operations. The fines cited by the industry — up to $27,500 per passenger — are the maximum, rarely imposed except in egregious cases. Moreover, the airlines control one factor in tarmac delays, their common practice of scheduling more flights than an airport can handle at peak times of day.
Most of the industry's fears can be resolved by reasonable interpretations of the new rule and reasonable efforts by the industry to prevent avoidable strandings.
Consider, for instance, an incident last August when 51 passengers were trapped on a Continental Express jet in Rochester, Minn., for five-and-a-half hours — within 50 yards of the terminal. A Mesaba Airlines employee, running the terminal, incorrectly insisted that
8
letting passengers in would compromise security. To use Smisek's word, it was inane for Continental to allow a bad call by another airline's employee to hold its customers hostage. Had the industry worked harder to prevent such outrages, regulators might never have become involved.
Airlines are right about one thing: Delays of more than three hours are relatively rare. Which should make it easier to react responsibly when they do occur.
Like many banks in the credit card industry, some airlines have gotten so used to abusing customers that it has become an accepted way to do business. But the political tides are turning. Last year, Congress passed a law to rein in credit card abuses. On Monday, the Senate approved broad protections for long-suffering airline passengers.
The carriers would be better off devoting their energies to treating fliers decently, rather than fighting rear-guard actions to undermine consumer protection.",,,,,,,

2. Detainment for more than 3 hours is an unreasonable hardship.
3. Passengers have a natural right to expect their flights to proceed at the times expected and paid for in their contract of carriage.
4. Passengers have a natural right to receive the truth from the airlines. If the airline is aware that chronic overscheduling will take place then it should inform the passengers prior to ticket purchase or say that their services will be unavailable at that airport. To pretend a service is available, when they know full well that there is a high probability that it will not be available is a decepetive business practice.
5. In line with 4 above it is a deceptive business practice to say you will provide transport and then detain passenger for 8 hours or more, knowing that this will happen time and again because the airline has not addressed its overscheduling issues and has no intention of doing so, even though it is perfectly reasonable and possible for them to do so.
6. Granting exemptions at these four airports is the 'thin end of the wedge' for overturning the legislation on a national basis.",,,,,,,

By their own admission, these delays are rare, so no exceptions should be granted.  Second, only JFK has a runway repair so why are EWR, LGA, and PHL [that is really stretching it] being requested?  Just another brazen attempt by the airlines to get out of following the rules.  Third, and again by their own admissions, they do not cancel flights because of low passenger counts as they need the aircraft and crew in another city, WHY would they now claim they will cancel a flight and have the same problem?????

A resounding NO should be the DOT's reply to this new airline scam.

I would like to strongly oppose some airline's attempts to obtain a temporary exemption form the 3 hour tarmac delay rule.  I have read briefs from both sides of the argument and it is clear to me that the airlines are just employing stall tactics.  

Actually, in my view, notwithstanding extenuating circumstances such as safety issues associated with severe weather, 3 hours is actually too generous.  European airline pilots have told me that they have a one hour limit and Canada I am told has a two hour limit. 

The bottom line as I see it, is that planes should not pull back from a gate unless taxi and take-off are imminent.  Passengers should not be involuntarily forced to stay in a grounded plane, which essentially is a closed non-moving container.  As a public health expert I can tell you some data on panic and anxiety attacks caused by claustrophobia, and a non-moving sealed plane qualifies as a claustrophic situation:  the lifetime incidence is between 8 and 13% of the general population, and as it applies to grounded airplanes the incidence is between 12% and 19%. That obviously represents a huge number of people and this constitutes a true public health problem.

Please uphold the DOT rule of 3 hours for tarmac delays and consider shortening it as they have done in Canada and Europe.

Respectfully submitted,

And, while it is not a trivial matter for airlines to adjust their operational schedules, a longstanding, systemic failure to schedule a reasonable number of flights to prevent congestion at major airports is more the cause of potential issues then the closure of a runway at JFK.  Airlines are a customer service business, and need to find a way to best serve their customers while operating in compliance with all government regulations.  The very need for the existance of a regulation protecting their customers from being unduly 'trapped' on aircraft for indefinite periods of time highlights the degree of the problem that airlines have not taken sufficient measures to address.  The problem is not a new one, and unfortunately, neither is the response of the airlines.  Due credit to the DOT for mandating a solution where one was not forthcoming from industry.

The airlines don't get it, do they?

Somehow along the way, the airlines started to think of passengers as freight, not as customers. Humans are not freight. 

You cannot start allowing exceptions to this three-hour rule anywhere! Why?  The airports listed are in fact airports where it would be fairly easy to bus passengers off a plane to the terminal and then reboard them in the same way.

And isn't ""kidnapping"" a FEDERAL crime???? Aren't hostage situations dealt with by the FBI? How long will it be before a sick individual dies on board? What tipping point are the airlines waiting for, exactly?

I had one dispute with the way an airline treated us -- and won. In spite of the award of two free tickets to anywhere, we have never flown that airline again.   Still won't. I am the guy with the credit card, not the box of freight.",,,,,,,

Excessive tarmac delays are tantamount to false imprisonment. It is now to the government to curb these practices since the airlines clearly cannot regulate themselves.

That should have given them, the FAA and the airport operators plenty of time to sit down and have a meeting to decide what the real airplane handling capacity of the airport was going to be during the construciton.

Then, simply, adjust the number of landings and take offs and even size of aircraft to matach the reduced capacity during construction. Perhaps that would mean fewer seats and higher prices. So be it.

I respectfully ask that this request be denied on grounds of very poor planning on the part of the airlines, FAA and airport owner. This is also supported by the passenger rights folks.",,,,,,,

We the undersigned member of the largest non-profit national  airline passenger  rights organization  representing 28,000  consumers in the United States wish to have our views considered in response to DOT Secretary LaHood’s recent request for public comments on the successive petitions of JetBlue, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Continental Airlines, and US Airways to free all airlines serving all three major New York area airports and the Philadelphia International Airport from the “maximum three-hour stranding limit” during the months when a major runway at John F. Kennedy International Airport is necessarily closed for reconstruction.
 First, we congratulate Secretary LaHood for adopting such a 3-hour rule in DOT’s recently-adopted passenger protection regulation so as to limit the amount of time that airline passengers can be stranded on airport tarmacs without an option to deplane, if such can be done safety and securely.  We have supported enactment of the similar “Airline Passengers Bill of Rights” provisions in S. 1586, as recently passed the Senate, and soon to be considered in the House-Senate Conference on the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2010.
 We believe DOT should deny the airlines’ petitions for many reasons:
  (1) It appears that the airlines are trying to get exempted from the 3-hour strandings limit at four major airports so that they can continue overscheduling flights beyond the temporarily reduced capacity of JFK’s runway system without any penalty.  We understand the JFK runway reconstruction program has been long planned, and believe the airlines should have better adjusted their operations to conform to JFK’s somewhat-reduced runway capacity for these few months.
(2) Airline passengers now understand that they have a new right not to be stranded on airline aircraft for many hours without any recourse.  If DOT were to approve these extraordinary airline requests – even before the new regulation is effective later this month – it would allow all airlines to impose strandings without any maximum time limit on millions of passengers who will be using these major East Coast airports in coming months; and
(3) In our view, the preferable solution would be for Secretary LaHood to instruct the Federal Aviation Administration to convene an early meeting of the airlines serving JFK and to require that they modify their “overscheduled” operations to conform to the currently available airport capacity so that passengers need not be stranded for hours on taxiways.
We agree with the views in the March 26 letter of Senators Boxer and Snowe to Secretary LaHood on this topic.  More specifically, we have reviewed the detailed comments being submitted to this docket this week by FlyersRights.org and support the analysis and recommendations of this airline passenger advocacy group. 
 Thank you for considering our views on this important consumer issue.  
 Sincerely,

To whom it may concern: I copied and pasted the part of questions from www.nad.org above. First, I applaud with DOT's new federal rules protecting Deaf and Hard of Hearing. I am myself Deaf-blind citizen. Do the new rules include the service providers such as Support Service providers (SSP)? The SSPs assist Deaf-blind passengers for visual, enivronment information, guide, and safety.

As you know, The Washington State Ferries (WSF) operates the largest system of its kind in the nation. Among other challenges, varying tides in the Puget Sound causes differences in the slope and  pitch of our ramps from the terminals to the vessels. Sections 39.25 and 39.83 of the proposed rule appear to give an exemption to providing services to passengers with disabilities if doing so would be “physically impossible”. Consistent with our commitment to providing equal access to persons with disabilities, our agency wants to make certain it complies with this rule uniformly throughout the system. However, the term ”physically impossible” appears to be subjective. Therefore, we strongly urge that a definition of what constitutes the basis for “physically impossible” be included in the rule.

In regards to Emotional Support Animals (ESAs) onboard a cruise, they should not be allowed.  ESAs are not allowed in hotels (except as pets in pets-allowed hotels, which usually charge a pet fee) and they are not allowed in land-based versions of the public areas on a ship (restaurants, pool decks, casinos, stores, athletic areas, spa areas, etc.).  They do not have the training required for an animal to behave in public spaces.  It takes many months of lots of training to get a service dog to the acceptable level of public access for a service animal.  There is not a way to train ESAs to this level, since they are not allowed in such places on land.  A dog confined to a small cruise cabin for the duration of a cruise, which is typically smaller than a hotel room, is cruel and inhumane.  Additionally, the presence of these pets onboard would be a potential distraction or threat to service animals, which therefore creates an illegal obstruction for access for those service animals' disabled handlers.  An aggressive ESA could also be a threat to human passengers and crew onboard the ship, as there are no training or behavior standards for ESAs and there is not always a way to remove an ill-behaving dog and its passenger from a cruise ship (when sailing, when docked in a country the dog cannot get off the ship at, etc.).

ESAs can be beneficial for people who have mental disabilities, but they do not belong on cruise ships, which are unique from land-based hotels, airplanes whose travel times are comparitively short, and other public modes of transportation and other public spaces.

In regards to other items in the rule, I hope you will add that the refrigerator for service dog food/disability-related items must be as accessible as possible to the individual (i.e. not a public refrigerator on the clear other end of the ship from the passenger's room if the passenger has a mobility disability which makes walking across the ship difficult, instead a mini-refrigerator should be placed in the passenger's room, which also protects the passenger and the service animal from anybody tampering with or stealing their items).  Some cruise lines currently give mini-refrigerators in cabins for disability-related items, but some cruise lines balk at the idea.  This would not be a costly thing for each ship or cruise line to have a stock of a few designated medical mini-refrigerators on hand for people who request them prior to embarkation day.

The cruise lines giving out dog import information for each country is a wonderful rule, as currently the cruise lines do not have this information, the USDA is not very helpful in regards to some countries' information, and some countries' information can be very hard to find and the countries' impossible to hear an answer from.  Thank you for this!  I hope the cruise lines will be required to keep abreast of any new regulations for the countries as well as to know about any special waiving of some requirements for service dogs on cruise ships that some countries have but do not advertise.

Thank you for making it harder for able-bodied people to book accessible cabins!  It is too bad that you are not requiring a doctor's letter as proof of need, as most people who have been denied a cabin due to able-bodied people booking them would be fine with such a requirement.  I hope the affidavit of disability one must sign to book an accessible cabin is under perjury of law so that able-bodied people do not just lie about needing the cabin.  I suggest that cruise lines state their question as, ""What accessible features of this room do you need?"" to try to prevent people from lying (as opposed to just asking, ""Do you need this room because it has accessible features?"").

In regards to service animal potty areas, some cruise lines do them well and others do not do them well (including, but not limited to, providing far too small of an area, preventing the dog and person from accessing the area due to it being behind a locked door at night, terrible materials for the potties, requiring the passenger to bring their own potty materials, placing the potty too far from the passenger's cabin, and refusing to place the potty on the passenger's balcony even though many other cruise lines do so).  What has worked for me and my service dog is a 6'x3' area of antimicrobially-treated faux grass over disposable potty pads (to catch the urine).

In regards to what a cruise line can require as proof that an animal is indeed a service animal under the laws, cruise lines should ask the same questions the DOJ allows, namely the one that asks, ""What tasks does your animal do for you that directly mitigate your disability?""  If the passenger cannot answer this question with an explanation of at least two tasks (as required by law), the cruise line can choose to not allow the passenger and their pet onboard.

Thank you for including CROs on cruise ships!

But Holland America said they had a policy that they wouldn't pay for any scooter damage.  Neither would they lift a scooter to get it off the ship.  All they needed was a longer gangplank so the pitch wouldn't be too steep for passengers.  Nowadays you can get retractable gangplanks.

We support the proposed rules.  People with disabilities will be increasingly able to enjoy vacations on cruise ships with health care reform and Medicaid buy in programs.  As we emerge from poverty people will want to participate in these vacation options.  People should be able to fully participate in all aspects of cruising without pricing penalties.  Effective communication for people with all kinds of disabilities is imperative particularly with regard to any access limitations in foreign ports.  Mobility devices must be fully allowed and in event of storage of any such devices cruise lines should retain full responsibility--these items are expensive and necessary for independence and mobility.  Similarly, no restriction on service animals should be permitted.  We believe that like the ACAA the cruise lines should allow emotional support animals that are under the full control of the owner.  The reason they are allowed on flights and in housing is because people with some types of disabilities cannot go without their animals on a day to day basis.  If someone is going to ""live"" on a cruise ship for a week or longer it follows to reason that they would need the animal for the duration of the cruise.  In fact, for people with certain kinds of disabilities that lend themselves to use of emotional support animals a cruise might be an ideal vacation because the person can choose how much to leave (or not) their ""home base"" of the vessel.  

We do believe that a ship should not have to provide personal assistance--it would be a nice gesture to allow  people with severe disabilities who require human assistance to do activities of daily living to have an attendant accompany them, staying in the same room, for no additional charge.",,,,,,,

These dogs are highly trained to do work to help their disabled handler with their daily lives.

Dear Secretary LaHood:

The Seeing Eye, the pioneers and innovators of dog guide services, has been providing specially bred and trained dog guides for blind citizens of the United States since 1929. Today, as more and more people turn to animals for improved health and quality of life, The Seeing Eye commends the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) for its efforts to create requirements for the transport of service animals on cruise ships and other passenger vessels.
 
In response to the department's questions about emotional support animals and the relationship of DOT and Department of Justice (DOJ) rules, The Seeing Eye offers the following comments for consideration: 

1. Emotional support animals 
The Seeing Eye believes that only animals that are capable of meeting or exceeding the same high training, behavioral and safety standards as that of Seeing Eye® dogs are suitable for public access. Therefore, we believe that the use of emotional support animals should be treated the same way on passenger vessels as it is in other public accommodations covered by the newly revised ADA regulations implementing Title II and Title III.

2. The overall relationship between DOJ and DOT ADA rules. 
The Seeing Eye urges the Department to amend Part 39 to be consistent with the new DOJ language. Using the same language will help to avoid confusion or any burden placed on people with disabilities or PVOs that might arise if different definitions or substantive provisions of different rules applied in the specific context of passenger vessel operations, as distinct from other aspects of public accommodations o",,,,,,,

These dogs are not Emotional Support Animals (ESA), which are pets that have no specific training to assist a disabled person with accessing public places.  Psychiatric service dogs are trained to perform work or tasks that benefit their mentally disabled partner.  Please do not confuse PSDs with ESAs.  

I have both an ESA and a PSDiT (PSD in Training).  My ESA is a cat that I've had for 10 years, he seems to know when I'm having severe depression issues and helps by keeping himself glued to my side almost 24/7.  Typically, he'll sit in my lap when he chooses to but he has no training and the work he performs would not be something that he could do outside of my house.  I would never consider taking him on a cruise, because I don't believe that he could handle the public access issues without stressing him (ie being crated to move from one place to another, being in a different location than he has been for the last 7 years, a different location for his litter box, etc).  My PSDiT on the other hand, is being specifically trained to handle the stress of public access and to assist me in public.  Once he is a PSD (no longer in formal training) he will be allowed to accompany me everywhere I choose to go, including restaurants, grocery stores, hospitals, public transportation, and so on.

I am a 100% disabled veteran (primarily due to combat related PTSD) and would one day like to go on a cruise.  However, in order to do that, I would need the assistance of my PSD (otherwise I would have to pay for an additional person to accompany me and perform some of the services that my PSD does for me).

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed ruling and hope that it will be changed to include the verbiage on the new ADA service animal definition.  This will ensure that DOJ employees are able to differentiate between PSDs and ESAs.   

Thank you.",,,,,,,

   An Emotional Support Animal has little or no training and is little more than a pet that has been prescribed by a doctor as a companion to give emotional support. Now while all Service Dogs give their handlers emotional support, a dog that’s sole purpose is to give emotional support without any training for public access, ie being housebroken, obedience trained for public access and trained to do work or tasks to assist their disabled handler is not a Service Dog, Psychiatric or otherwise.

   Psychiatric Service Dogs should be allowed on cruise ships and any place that any other type of Service Dog or Guide Dog is allowed. Their high standard of training is essentially the same.

   I however do not approve of allowing Emotional Support Animals on cruise ships because they are not required to have public access training, are not required to have any other training, are not required to be housebroken and may be almost any kind of animal such as a snake or rabbit.",,,,,,,

Yes. All Service Animals are trained to mitigate a persons disability and are also trained in public access.  For whatever disability (physical or mental), any Service Animal should be able to travel with their disabled partner/handler at all times in all public places of any  passenger vessel including all entertainment portions of a cruise/vacation line. The DOT needs to also include the wording for ""Psychiatric Service Dogs"" to be among the rulings and definition of Service Animals. This has been newly added by DOJ as well. 

However, Emotional Support Animals (ESAs) should be given access for transportation purposes only.  They should not have the same access as that of Service Animals on board a passenger vessel that would be considered a cruise or vacation line.  ESAs should have a very limited access aboard a passenger ship of this type.  For daily activities of a cruise ship, it should not have access. An ESA should be maintained in the cabin of a cruise ship at all times. An ESA should not allowed in dining halls, or other activities involving other passengers, as they may not be fit for public access and become a danger to others and those using Service Animals. This would be consistent to the DOJ model that one would have to follow with a ESA stateside on land. The DOJ does not give public access rights to those with an ESA, and the DOT should follow these rulings for ESAs.",,,,,,,

They are not.  Psychiatric Service Dogs undergo 1 to 2 years of specialized training as well as advanced obedience training that will allow a person with Mental Illness to function in society.  While Emotional Support Animals are wonderful they are not specifically trained to mitigate a person’s disability which is really what a Service Dog is for.  All Service Dogs provide a measure of emotional support for their handlers but their function is to mitigate mental or physical impairments that substantially limits a major life activity.   While mental illness is not always visible it is very real and just as disabling as physical impairments.  My use of a Psychiatric Service Dog has allowed me to function outside of my home which had previously been an impossibility and although I am an “animal lover” I would gladly trade my wonderful Service Dog for a life without mental illness.  I would be perfectly happy having a dog for a pet which is basically what an Emotional Support Animal is.  However, since I am a disabled person, my Psychiatric Service Dog is a very necessary part of my health care.  I’m asking that you not limit or possibly eliminate my ability to enjoy a cruise by erroneously putting Psychiatric Service Dogs in the same category as an Emotional Support Animal.",,,,,,,

This airline is substandard on many levels and any other reasonable alternative would be preferred.  Georgia Skies has not shown any true willingness to create business, (except for a small advertising campaign beginning 3 months ago...and done so only for positioning prior to the new round of bids).  Georgia Skies customer service or lack thereof has been well documented, the airline is incapable of boarding wheel-chair bound passengers, they have flown their planes with only one pilot on board on several ocassions and the airline constantly has delays and cancellations. It is the opinion of most observers that this airline simply wishes to benefit from the sibsidy program without putting any real effort to build and maintain a customer base...and I dare say, if given the subsidy, would go back to their brand of ""business as usual"".  The Middle Georgia Regional Airport, as it is now, is hanging on but another two years of this airline and I dare say commercial flights from Macon will be done, forever.  It would be preferable to have no airline rather than Georgia Skies.",,,,,,,

psychiatric service animals; psychiatric service dogs are no more susceptible to fraudulent activities than any other type of service animal.

Recently I had to return from a trip 4 days early and was very anxious about wether the 48 hour advance notice would be covered under the flight change. I was treated cordially by everyone at the airport until I was waiting in line at the gate where I was met by a gentleman with suspician who requested muy boarding pass. He checked it and came back with a smile to me wishing me a good flight. 

I would like to be treated like everyone else: with and without disabilities.",,,,,,,

My PSA's are able to alert me to oncoming anxiety levels which without their ""advance warning"", escalates to disabling Panic Attacks, so bad that I have had people out in public thinking I was having a heart attack. Since having my two PSA's I have not had a Panic Attack ""while they were on me."" Because of their advance warning, they provide me the opportunity to mitigate the episode's through structured interactions with both animals that include deep breathing exercises and the employment of cognitive behavioural skills. My PSA's allow me to live a more normal life without constant medications and their nasty side effects. They also give me confidence to go out into the public eyes. 
Most people simply assume that the ADA and USDOJ's rules are law and that no one is exempt from having to obey the ADA and USDOJ. Taxi services, Bus Lines and Trains also governed under the DOT must obey the ADA and USDOJ. Why is the ACAA different? 
The ACAA governs what, ""private entities that provide a public service."" They provide transportation to people therefore they provide public accommodations right? So what makes them exempt from the ADA and USDOJ's rules? Is it only because at 27000 feet you can't simply pull over and eject a passenger or it's possibly out of control ESA? ESA's do not have the same public rights by the ADA, as PSA's do. (Without proper PSA public accommodations training) an ESA could itself have anxiety or panic issues in an aircraft. I can see where in an aircraft ""some animal's"" in that condition could be a problem. 
Does that make it fare for the ACAA to have the authority to violate Disabled Americans Rights by discriminating against them because they have a ""hidden disability"", by requiring advance notice and proof?",,,,,,,

The seconed half is socialization. In the case of Psychiatric Service Dogs it works best for the recipent of the dog to do the socilizing. Reason being the dog must spend as much time as posable with the recipient to ensure the best bonding. Bonding early on in the relationship will alow the dog to get to know the recipients physical and emotional responces to stress. Having the recipient be part of socialization proses alows he or she to experiance a feeling of responsability in a way that is stress free. During the training they experiance the feefing of acomplishment when their dog respondes well to their instructions.During training they experiance the feelings of confort when venturing out into a world they nolonger feel comfortable in.Finaly the feeling of pride that they will get when their dog graduates to the position of Psychiatric Service Dog.

RE:	Docket OST-2010-0026

To the Office of the Secretary, DOT:

DOT’s proposed rulemaking would change MRO qualification requirements as follows:

1.	MROs would have to certify with a DOT-approved board.
2.	MROs would have to recertify every five years.
3.	DOT would no longer require MRO continuing education.

Certification Bodies Have Competed by Relaxing Exam Standards


There are currently two competing MRO certification bodies: the Association of Medical Review Officers (AAMRO) and the Medical Review Officer Certification Council (MROCC).  Both groups now offer on-line, at-home recertification examinations without time limits and with liberal re-take policies.  Almost everyone who tries to recertify does.  While either AAMRO or MROCC could make recertification more rigorous, neither is inclined to do so if it means many MROs would recertify with the other, easier program.  This was demonstrated by the many MROCC-certified MROs who recertified with AAMRO because it gave the exam by mail as a take-home test and MROCC did not.  In 2005, MROCC started offering on-line, at-home recertification examinations without time limits.  MROCC thought this was less rigorous, but it was a business decision to more effectively compete with AAMRO’s take-home test.  AAMRO has since put its recertification exam on-line, too.  Some other medical certification bodies offer on-line recertification exams, but the more rigorous ones give the exams only at testing centers and with time limits.

MROCC requires MRO CME to recertify.  AAMRO gives CME for taking its recertification exam and says this is sufficient.  In this and other regards (e.g., the proctored exams), MROCC has typically been more rigorous than AAMRO.  If DOT drops its MRO CME requirement, MROCC may do the same rather than lose MROs who opt for AAMRO’s less rigorous requirements.

Legitimate Medical Boards Require CME

MROCC originally modeled itself after the boards given by members of the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS).  The ABMS recertification process, now referred to as maintenance of certification, includes specialty-specific CME requirements.  This is also true of many non-ABMS specialty boards, including two that many MROs are familiar with: the American Board of Independent Medical Examiners and the Federal Aviation Administration program for aviation medical examiners.  The FMCSA is developing a recertification process, as described in its 2008 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, that includes a CME requirement and examination.  Some medical specialty certification bodies require high standards of training and performance and ensure them by rigorous examinations.  Others are fringe boards that are mostly interested in selling courses at vacation resorts, books, and exams based on their books.

Oversight Can Improve Quality

I applaud DOT (and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA) for wanting to evaluate MRO certification bodies and indicate which one(s) they approve of.  Without regulation, market competition lowers the bar on certification and drives down the quality of MROs.  Certification should be driven by the need to protect the public, the employees who are tested, and the employers who conduct testing.  This can be accomplished by leveling the playing field with high standards for certification.  Concerns may be raised that higher standards will reduce the number of certified MROs and drive up costs.  My experience as someone who has educated thousands of MROs is that most MROs handle just a few non-negative results each month and charge little for their work.  As of 2009, MROCC had certified more than 9000 MROs and AAMRO had certified about 5500 MROs.  The marketplace for selling MRO services is highly competitive and I see no evidence of an MRO shortage.

I have always appreciated and sometimes sought greater direction from federal regulators.  I believe DOT and SAMHSA can, through their oversight, help elevate the standards for MRO certification and recertification.  DOT and SAMHSA may decide to include CME criteria for approval of MRO certification bodies.  I do not know if DOT’s proposal to remove CME requirements is because DOT considers CME unnecessary or because DOT prefers to let each certification body decide.   I would prefer DOT retain the CME requirement because the two certification bodies have little incentive to go beyond the federal minimum standards.

MROs Should Take MRO-Specific CME

I think recertification should include some requirement for MRO-related CME because this is what other legitimate certification bodies do, and because it elevates the standards expected of MROs.  Some physicians complain they participate in too many subspecialty certifications that each require focused CME.  For example, a physician who is an MROCC- certified MRO, AME, FMCSA Medical Examiner, and ABIME-certified examiner would have to take CME in each of these areas.  Some states and physician groups have imposed on physicians additional focused CME requirements, such as CME in risk management.  There is no easy answer, except to point out that these CME requirements are typically modest – e.g., DOT’s current requirement for 12 hours in 3 years – and some physicians may be getting certifications they do not really need.  There is no easy answer, except to participate only in those certifications that really matter.  Subspecialty certifications are not intended to be collected like “merit badges” or other awards, but instead represent current competency.

I think DOT should mandate MRO CME, e.g., 15 hours every 5 years.  I like DOT’s proposal to change the recertification period to 5 instead of 6 years, mostly because 5 is easier than 6 to keep track of.



I have helped write MROCC’s certification exam and its MRO Manual, have taught in MRO training courses, and have produced MRO CME programs.  This editorial was not written by an MROCC official and does not necessarily represent MROCC’s position.

Commentary on behalf of the Detroit Medical Center


With over 2,000 licensed beds and 3,000 affiliated physicians, the Detroit Medical Center (DMC) is the leading academically integrated system in metropolitan Detroit and the largest health care provider in southeast Michigan.  In addition to maintaining its own Drug Free Workplace and active employee drug testing program, the DMC proudly offers drug testing services to business, industry and the community.  The DMC is committed to quality and safety, and thus presents commentary in response to this DOT NPRM.

Drug testing in the transportation industry is essential to assure the public safety.  However, this procedure is not without detractors and controversy.  In order to protect the individuals who undergo testing, to ensure that the goals of public safety are met, and to gain popular acceptance of the program, quality and integrity in the drug testing process must not be compromised.  Both a false accusation due to an error in the collection, testing and review process, or a failure to detect substance abuse when there is the illicit presence of a controlled substance found in the urine, are unacceptable.  Thus, the DOT drug testing program and regulations have evolved with highly refined quality assurance components addressing collections, chain of custody for specimens, laboratory analysis, medical review, reporting and employer follow up.  Because the integrity of this process is so important, a Medical Review Officer (MRO), a licensed physician with in depth knowledge of drug testing and DOT regulations, is charged with quality assurance oversight.  To ensure that the MRO is qualified to assume this responsibility, specialized training has evolved along with certification programs to examine the competence of the MRO.  

We applaud both DHHS and DOT efforts to establish that training and certification programs are adequately rigorous and valid to promote the development and certification of competent MROs.  We support the proposed requirement that training and certification programs be approved, and encourages the active roles of both DHHS and DOT in the approval process.  

Recognizing that the field of drug testing evolves with technology and regulatory changes, current MRO certifying bodies offer a time limited certification.  However, we believe that this should be a requirement, and the five year cycle is quite appropriate.  

Approved certifying bodies should be expected to subject the applicant for certification to stringent prerequisites, including an adequate training requirement based upon CEU’s  (CME's).  Only if that can be assured, would the CEU requirement in the regulations become unnecessary.

Finally, with regard to the expansion of drug testing to include drugs such as MDMA and its analogs, we view that quite favorably as another public safety enhancement.  In fact, we would encourage a further expansion to include drugs like hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, benzodiazepines and barbiturates, given the impact of such drugs on safety-sensitive work.  However, we understand that the DOT must follow DHHS in the selection of drugs to include in its panel.

These groups began historically as entities that were established by MRO's to ensure the education, research and consistencies in the MRO process at a time when the federal government would only provide basic guidelines for the MRO process. The top three certification groups have done very well at policing and informing their members and have become respected in the field. Annual certification could only lead to increased costs to the organizations and, hence, their members. As these costs rise I believe the cost of MRO services will have to rise. Even small increases will translate to large sums for the millions of tests performed. If federal oversight of certification entities is necessary then I believe that it should occur much as the DOT requires for Breath Alcohol Technician recertification.   (Dr. Thuss)",,,,,,,

Regarding the proposed rule-making:  
49 CFR 40.  Docket OST-2010-0026.  RIN 2105-AD95.
We own and operate a Part 135 on-demand air taxi in Alaska.  We are supportive of the new proposed regulation entitled ""Harmonizing with HHS"", item number 4, proposing the adoption the following HHS laboratory testing requirements.  In addition to these proposed DOT testing requirements, we request the expansion of the said panel to include ALTERNATE OPIATES.   
Alternate opiates are prescription drugs that are commonly marketed illegally for a much greater street value.  Currently, the DOT drug testing panel does not include alternate opiates, which unlike organic opiates, cannot be detected in the current DOT drug testing panel due to their different chemical makeup.   This gap in testing requirements is likely leaving the public and operators like us at risk, as these are increasingly popular drugs of abuse.
The Alaska State Troopers, Alaska Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Enforcement, seized these types of drugs from a customer that checked in to board one of our aircraft.  After the incident, the troopers informed our company that the following drugs:  Oxycodone and Hydrocodone (alternate opiates), have taken the lead as the mostly highly marketed and abused drugs in Alaska (personal communication, Sargeant Thompson and Trooper Cross, Anchorage, AK, March 2009).  Law enforcement agencies in other states may have similar data about alternate opiates, that would be worthy of review.
As an aviation operator, we have learned a good deal about the prevalence of ALTERNATE OPIATES, their highly addictive nature, easy access and potential for abuse, since they are not detected in DOT drug tests. By adding alternate opiates to to the DOT panel,  you will help operators to better protect the public safety.  If you have any questions for us, please feel free to call myself, or Daniel Owen, D. of Operations: 907-276-5422.  
Respectfully,
Josanne Breeding-Owen/ Secretary-Treasurer",,,,,,,

To bridge the gap between DOT rules and carrier obligations, FlightStats is willing to serve as a third party entity that can provide flight performance information to carriers, in a form that enables a carrier to easily display the required data on the carrier?s web site.

Last month I was offered $175 as compensation for being bumped from a late-night flight which would have caused me to stay overnight and miss a family event. Luckily, a college student liked the deal and I got home. 

I asked the airline agent why they offered such little compensation on a flight that costs $600. A shrug was the only answer from the tired and frustrated attendant.",,,,,,,

1) Much of our local industry operates on central time, yet our schools and government do not, creating scheduling difficulties and conflicts with children's activities and work schedules.  
2) Our largest regional trade center (Bismarck) is on central time, making it difficult to travel and make larger purchases after normal local business hours.  This hurdle forces us to use the internet more for purchases, many times resulting in out of state purchases that could have been done in-state.
3) Because we are on the eastern edge of the mountain time zone, the ability to perform work outside in the evening is quite limited with natural lighting.  This creates additional hazards when doing outside chores after a normal work-day.  Having the extra hour of evening light would be quite beneficial for outside work in the evening.",,,,,,,

Many of our residents are required to see medical specialists in the Bismarck area for a variety of medical procedures and follow-up visits.  Oftentimes the resident must be in Bismarck by 6 a.m. central time.  That means the resident must awaken at 3 a.m. mountain time to prepare for the trip, leaving Beulah no later than 3:30 a.m. mountain time, in order to arrive by the scheduled appointment.

Our staff are also impacted by the time zone difference.  Because of our type of industry, we must rely upon contract agency staffing to fill open shifts in the nursing department.  So often the agency staff are late because they assume Beulah is on central time.  These individuals come from Minot, Bismarck, and the surrounding areas, mostly within the central time zone.

Additionally, professionals, contractors and suppliers for our facility schedule appointments based upon central time.  Although we do communicate the time zone differences, the difference is oftentimes overlooked, which results in missed appointments, missed telephone conference calls, etc.

Changing Mercer County to the Central Time Zone would be beneficial for Knife River Care Center and the surrounding area.  Please take these few issues into consideration when making your decision.  Thank you for your time.",,,,,,,

This makes communications with these entities very difficult and wastes valuable time.  

On a personal note, if one elects to travel either by train or plane out of Bismarck or Minot, the availability of these modes of transportaion often involves early morning departures and/or late evening arrivals making travel difficult and more expensive as you may need to stay in the city overnight.  

Medical issues and treatment follow the same scenario - the time difference between Mercer County, Minot & Bismarck make scheduling appointments very difficult.

It will make the ease of doing business for our Hazen office much easier. Right now most of our company offices are located in central time zone. They get to work an hour before I do, take lunch an hour before I do, and leave at least an hour before I do at the end of the day. This turns my 8 hour work day into a less than a 4 hour day that I am able to contact my underwirters at my companies. This creates a big problem at times with getting the best service possible to my customers. With many of my companies I am unable to contact them past 3 p.m. mountain time and that is a hinderance to my business. 
Many of the households in Beulah and Hazen have to work around the inconvinience of having two sets of clocks in the house. One spouse working in downtown and the ohter working at one of the various power plants. This is a constant bother with the question of ""your time or my time"" between spouses.
With these two points stated it is obvious that I am for Mercer County switching to central time. 
Honestly I think the whole state should be central time...and thats coming from someone who grew up on Bowman County, 30 miles from the MT border.

Many of our major employers in Mercer County already operate on Central Time and have their corporate offices located in the Central Time Zone.  Our community receives nearly all of its television, radio, and daily newspapers from the Central Time Zone.  Major transportation services such as airline, bus, and rail are mainly located in the Central Time Zone.  Geographically we are bordered on the North, South and East by Central Time.  Major medical services are in the Central Time Zone.

The Beulah Chamber of Commerce feels that for the convenience of commerce in our area we should  be on Central Time.",,,,,,,

-many major employers in Mercer County work on Central Time 
- People that work on Central Time in Mercer County forget about the people that live here and need to run businesses & school activities on Mountain Time. (These activities & business needs are mostly with the Central Time Zone) 
- Doing business in the Mountain Time Zone is very difficult considering we are surrounded by Central Time and we lose 1 hour every morning, 2 hours for lunch breaks, and 1 hour every evening. This happens with the majority of suppliers, vendors, and contractors that we do business with. 
- Stanton school district in Mercer County goes to school on CT 
- Students in Mercer County miss more school than most when doing extra-curricular activites with the majority of schools around us that ARE in the Central Time Zone. 
- Finding employees to work on Mountain Time when their family members live & have jobs on Central Time is VERY difficult. 
- Many possible employees for Mercer County LIVE in a Central Time Zone (Hebron, Glen Ullin, Center) and they do not want to be away from their family later in the evening, which would happen working 8am-5pm MT (9am-6pm CT) 

Please allow the citizens & businesses of Mercer County the benefit of being on the same time zone as everyone around us. And the benefit of being able to have an 8-hour workday on Mountain Time vs. the 4-hour work day we currently have when doing the majority of our business with Central Time Zone businesses. Thank you.",,,,,,,

Resident's of Mercer County have voted in favor of the change to central time twice.",,,,,,,

I just finished speaking to our son who lives in Bismarck (Central time zone) a daughter in Glen Ullin (Central time zone) ourselves in Mountain time zone, ( Beulah,ND) trying to coordinate a time to meet at the Interstate 94 to ride together to a basketball tournament at Dickinson ( Mountain Time) that starts at 6:00 PM.  Try and do that some time allowing for about 50 minutes to eat before the games. Very simple------try it some time.   If Williston, ND is on central time it would only be logical to think that all of ND should be on Central time.  Period-- I vote Yes !!!!!!!",,,,,,,

I have found that it is very inconvenient to basically live in 2 time zones - mountain and central.  The public school can operate on either zone, and as important as sports is to this community having us on central will help with games and the students' schedule for sleep and the missing of school.  The local businesses can also be open on either zone. Most of the industry operates in central time or have their own operating hours no matter which zone we are in.  I have heard of many people who have stated that their house runs on central time but the kids' schedule operate on mountain.  This means that homes are divided by the time zones.  Another major contributing factor for cause of confusion is  medical reasons esp. elderly.  Any time one has to go to Bismarck, which is usually where they go, for medical reasons the personal in Bismarck operate only on central time.  It is up to the pt, pt's family dr., nurse, ambulance, etc. to switch the time to mountain.  Many tests, operations, appointments, etc, are scheduled early in the morning - Bismarck time - and that means really early for us.  An example is a student who needs to see the orthodontist for braces checkup can go early so as not to miss as much school but then is very tired the rest of the day.  Or can have the appointment at a more decent time but will miss more school that day.  Our school policy is not that forgiving for dr. appts.  An 8am CT appt. means 7am MT.  Then there is an 1-1/2 hour drive so that means 5:30am leave home (without travel complications).  That means up at 4:30 to get ready for the day.  This makes for a very short night for students. Airline travel is similar.  Now for the cows,  they really don't use watches and the farmers do time changes twice a year as it is.  Tradition and not wanting to change is not reason enough.  We fulfill the requirements you put forth for a change to CT and should become CT.  Thanks.",,,,,,,

The kids in our schools lose a lot of classroom time when they have to go out of county for any reason they leave school 1 or 2 hours early which is not fair to the students as they have to make up classes missed.
I used to work on a dairy farm as a young man. We got up with the sun and quit after dark. That don't change with the clock.
I firmly believe that everyone would be better off if Central Time was extended to the Montana border making all of North Dakota the same.

You get a few poeple who don't like something so they want to change it for everyone else I don't think so.  If you want to live in a Central time zone go ahead and move.  If you want to live a Pacific time zone move there.  You don't need to change the time zone it is ridiculous.  The time zone lines should have never been messed with.

Also counties to the south and west of mercer county have already changed to central time.  In my opinion the entire state of North Dakota should be changed to central time.

I work on central time zone and live in Mountain time zone and love it that way. Most drug stores in the local area close at 5 pm, the post office closes at 4:30 and most bank's lobbies close at 3 pm. If we make the switch to central time zone, I will not be able to make the post office OR the bank, and the drug store would be close. So I don't see how this would be a good change for businesses unless they make their hours longer, which I highly doubt they will do.

Also, their needs to be a CLEAR dividing line between central and mountain time zone and allowing SOME of the communities west of the Missouri Rive to switch was and is not a good idea....it was common sense when you were west of the river, you were on mountain time and east of the river was central time. Now that the DOT is allowing certain communities to switch, you never know what time zone you are in for that specific community. It should've never been messed with in the first place. If you want to be on Central time zone, then MOVE to central time zone!!!

How many times can certain invdividuals bring this issue up until they get the results they want???? I think enough is enough.",,,,,,,

The nice thing about changing the state into Central Time is the western border of the state... from Williston to Dickinson... It would be much easier if there was only one time zone... and if not.. a division with a straight line from the Northern Boarder to the Southern... not this zig zagging back and forth. Anyway you look at it... the cows will still produce milk and the chickens will always lay eggs... they have no concept of time... only man runs on a specific time. ND., SD., NE., KS., & OK. all have a western boardeer ... a direct line from the Canadian Boarder to Tx... where Central Time should be in place.

I am secretary/treasurer of the Knife River Indian Heritage Foundation in Stanton, ND which is in Mercer County.  We have many tourists within our state as well as those who come from out of state that are confused about the time change for our workshops, conferences and many projects that take place at the Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site.  The tourists arrive either an hour early or an hour late to the Park.
We set up bus tours with companies from Minot and Bismarck, ND which are on Central Time, so there is confusion again with tourists riding the buses.  Many don't realize that the time change line is 22 miles to the east when you cross the river.
I personally have grandchildren in the county who attend one school and co-op sports at another school.  Many kids have come an hour late for sports or drama practice because they assumed they were given the correct time for their school.  It would be so much simpler if the entire state was on the same time zone, so I am asking you to please change the whole state to the same time zone.  Thank you.",,,,,,,

The change would make many things in our lives less complicated.  Living on two time zones is challenging and also brings problems - missed appointments, insufficient time for activities or appointments.

Please listen to the voices of our communities who wish to change to Central time - these are the voices of our community's future.

With the majority of ND on central time, it would be immensely advantageous to have the same time zones throughout the state.

Medical appointments outside of the county would prove to be much more convenient for us to make and less trivial to schedule if Mercer County was on central time.  

As a two-income household, one works on central time while the other works on mountain time.  

Our children attend school on mountain time, however, the majority of their sporting events and extra-curricular activities are on central time.  It would certainly be easier to live life on ONE time zone instead of juggling between the two.  

For these reasons and more, we strongly vote in favor of Mercer County's change from mountain time to central time.

I work at a power plant on central time so I pretty much live on central time anyways.  I've seen where many people who also work at the plants on central time worry about the banks and post office being closed when they get off of work.  They have days off where they can do that sort of stuff, or most banks can do stuff online anymore.  I would like to have it where if I am making a doctor's appointment or something is Bismarck, I don't have to get up at 4:00 a.m. so I can make it to my appointment.

To the farmers:  The time change is not going to make your cows stop making milk, or stop your fields from growing.  The chickens will still lay eggs; I know this because my in-laws have chickens and they still lay eggs and they live in central time. 

It would be better for the schools, for the area businesses, for transportation needs.  It would be a total benefit for Mercer county to GO TO CENTRAL TIME!!!!!!!!",,,,,,,

Now that I am retired and facing lots of visits to Bismarck for doctor appointments, this has created much confusion. All of our shopping out of the county is in central time cities, busines dealings are either in Mercer County or central time cities. We have little or no contact with Dickinson which is the only major city in North Dakota on Mountain Time. 

Right now we have central time to the south, north and east of us. We had a county vote on this issue and the majority voted for the change. It is only a matter of time that the state will all be one time zone, but this change is taking forever.",,,,,,,

Where ever the central time zone line is drawn there will be someone, some school district or some business that will want to change their time because they are closely interactive with people & business on the other side of the time zone line.  Not to mention that with this proposed change our 12:00 hour by the sun will be earlier than it should be. I understand The Greenwich Mean Time line is approximately at Buffalo ND. So if you are going to move this time line anywhere it should be to that location or the east border of ND. In other words enough is enough. If your goal is to put the whole state on one time zone follow the world time zones already established.",,,,,,,

Most of the workers in Mercer County already use Central time as the power plants and coal mines run their daily opperations on Central time. 

Shopping in Bismarck now is hard because you have to realize the time change and try to coordinate everything before the stores close.

I and my wife are strongly in favor of converting Mercer County to Central Time. 

I work in an office environment and because our work requires us to do a majority of our important business with others in Central Time it we struggle every day with coordianting timelines. It is a continuous struggle scheduling meetings, teleconferences, webinars and seminars. 

We surrounded on three sides by Central Time. Efforts to go on Central Time in other parts of the state, if approved, will put Mercer even further into a pocket of confusion.

Our office loses productive time in trying to communicate with Central Time associates by the tune of about 4 hours a day. Our school struggles with time zone isssues continusously as do schools that are are Central Time dealing with scheduling here.

Most of the industries here as well as a large cooperative already set their clocks to and operate on Central time. Mercer County, in my mind, will be a better place for our work and recreational environment once it is aligned with Central Time. Considering how lopsided the current time zone is here -- one would think that it would be quickly remedied by converting to Central Time. To us its just that obvious.I, along with my wife, are looking forward to the proposed change and strongly recommend that it be done as soon as possible.

I see in the paper that the school is in favorite for the change, but why this means that kids will be out of school for an hour or more while their parents are still at work.  The plants in the area get done with work at 3:00 to 3:30 MST just in time to pick up their children from school. I'm a rancher and I work long enough days with out the extra hour of sun light at night. In spring me and my husband do not get into the house until 8:00 MST if we were on CST it would be 9:00. And the sun does not raise until around 7:00 MST in the winter so that would be 8:00 CST. Which means the school buses would be running in the dark in the morning. And I know that I would much rather have my child driving in the day light in the middle of winter then in the dark.  I think if this time zone change goes though this small towns will lose a lot of business.  Because frankly why would some body want to take out work to do business when they can go to Bismarck on a Saturday and get every thing they need. I have lived in Beulah for 25 years and we have survived this long on MST, why change now? So please look at everything and like I said at the beginning it has been turned down twice.

To Department of Transportation Representatives:

I am writing this letter in response to your upcoming time change hearing in Mercer County.

I would like to go on the record as being opposed to the change to Central Time in Mercer County for the following reasons:


1.	Many of the working people of Mercer County are employed by the energy industry and work 
on Central Time.  This proves to be very convenient because you actually get off work an
hour early.  This gives you an additional precious hour in which to be home before your kids
get home from school so you can be there for them at what many experts call the “critical time”.  The extra hour is also very helpful when it comes to conducting business at the banks, medical facilities
courthouse, law offices, and many other local businesses that close at 5 or 5:30 mountain time.  I feel this would adversely affect many businesses because people simply would not
be able to get there in order to do their business.  It may even force people in the western
part of the county to take their business elsewhere to towns like Killdeer or Dickinson
where they can have the advantage of an extra hour, just as the folks in northern and western Oliver County bring their business to Hazen and Beulah instead of Center and Mandan.

2.	As for the argument that it is too confusing, I also have to disagree.  My job requires me to deal 
with people from all different areas of the country and you simply have to learn to compensate.  Some times in a work day I talk to businesses on both coasts within a few 
minutes of one another.  As business people are learning to participate in the new
global economy this is just another one of the little things you compensate for.  When you
need to deal with folks out east you simply do it right away in the morning.  When you deal
with folks out west you simply schedule it a little later in the day.
	
3.	The time differential also allows parents to be more involved in there children’s after school
        activities.  Parents are now able to help with extra curricular things such as coaching, scout
        leaders, and religion teachers simply because they are home from work early.  These things
        are more important today than ever because of single parent families and families where both
        parents are working to simply make ends meet.  For family reasons alone we the people 
        of Mercer County should consider the time difference a blessing and not a curse.


4.	As I understand many of our local businesses are the big proponents of this time change.
I really hope that they understand that though this may make things slightly more convenient,
it could in all likelihood cost them a lot of business that is really their bread and butter.
They also need to realize that with the development of a global economy they may find
themselve’s converting time, or even days from half a world away in order to survive.  That
struggle to survive is going to make converting time one way or another for an hour seem
very insignificant.

In closing I would like to add that no matter where the timelines are drawn they are going to inconvenience some and help others so why does it just need to be “moved down the road”.  The river is a natural boundary that has served us well, let’s keep it there.  The DOT has already created confusion by allowing the “patchwork” of counties west of the river to convert to central time.  There was no confusion when you merely had to add or subtract an hour when crossing the river.  Now you have to try and figure out which county is on which time.  Do not make it any worse!

Sincerely,
Wayne Windhorst

Docket#OST-2010-00

I have been employed in, and have been a resident of Mercer County for 35 years and have wrestled with this time zone issue for the duration of that time. It has been a considerable inconveniece for my family and I resulting in missed appointments, scheduling problems, and complete misunderstandings as to what time is what. The vast majority of events, medical appointments, and business is done with businesses that opperate in the Cental Time zone. 
Just one example would be medical tests and surgeries that are almost always done in the early morning hours at facilities in the Central Time zone area. Having to rise and prepare at that early of an hour plus compensate for travel time can be not just inconvenient, but unsafe as well due to lost sleep.
 I also operated a business for 5 years and found the time change to be the greatest interuption in my entire day. All of my daily dealings with providers and suppliers were extremely complicated by constant wrangling around, misaligned opening hours, lunch breaks, and closing times.
To conclude, the people in this county operate almost completely with, and are dependant on, Central Time providers of medical services, food suppliers, banking, transportation, and all other goods and services. It just makes sense to operate on the same time schedule as they do.",,,,,,,

Trying to travel a further distance than that, or flying out of Bismarck early, is downright impossible without staying overnight in a motel.  Like us, many of our friends have had to do this dozens of times throughout the years.  Another thing that just doesn't seem the way nature intended is the sun is up by 4:30 am in the summer, yet it's getting dark by 9:00 pm.  I don't see many farmers getting up that early around here:)  In the winter, we go to work in the dark, and many of us are coming home in the dark.  It would be nice to see a little sunlight after 4:30 in the afternoon.  These are just a few of the disadvantages that we have had to put up with when our neighbors on three sides of us haven't had to worry about it at all.  When they come to our town and arrive one hour early, because they've forgotten to adjust for the time, they can't understand it either.",,,,,,,

When changing to Central time we will lose an unknown amount of business from plant workers that commute every day back to their homes in Bismarck and surrounding areas. Has anyone taken the effects this will have on our businesses into consideration? We are in a recession already do we need to make it any worse for these small town businesses that sometimes struggle to make it?
I personally work at a power plant, have lived here almost all my life, I moved away for college & to try different parts of the country, however I found myself back here. In all the years I have been here changing from one time zone to another has never been an inconvenience nor has it caused any truly significant problems. So when I continually see that we are still battling it out whether to change from Mountain time to Central time I wonder why we are spending so much time & money on such an insignificant situation.   Why not spend this time & money making our area more attractive than it already is to people from other states to bring their families here and raise them, or to fight the drug problems we have or work on getting more opportunities for the younger kids so that they want to stay in the area or move out for college and return to raise their families? 
Is the time zone we are living in so bad that we can justify spending this money? If you want to live in Central time then change your clocks to central time or move to central time zone!",,,,,,,

As a Dentist in Beulah for 28 years I have dealt with confused patients on a daily basis concerning the time of their appoinments.  It is confusing for those who work on central time and need to schedule appts on mountain time.  We refer about five patients per day to specialists in Bismarck on central time.  People who have 8:00 AM appts in Bismarck must leave Beulah by 5:45 AM mountain time to make the appt.  Another difficulty is the two hours of time lost when we are unable to visit with specialist's offices in Bismarck because they are closed from 11:00 to 12:00 mountain time for their lunch, and at 4:00 PM mountain time they close for the day.  If we in Mercer County were on Central time these problems would be solved.

I strongly support the change to central time for the above stated bussiness reasons.

This is in reference to the request by the Mercer County Commission, Mercer County, North Dakota, to change the time zone of Mercer County, North Dakota from Mountain time to Central time.
I firmly believe that any time a change is made that affects the residents of any political subdivision, the change has to either address a problem or secure some kind of advantage.  I would like to go through the alleged reasons as submitted by the Mercer County Commission for the proposed change to Central time and check if either of these would be met.
The first claim is that virtually all the supplies for businesses are supplied from Central time zone areas.  In conversation with local business owners, Beulah (the largest city in Mercer County) is on the dividing line between supply from the east (Central) and supply from the west (Mountain).  The local lumberyard receives material from both areas and the two local auto parts stores, one is supplied from Bismarck (Central) with the other supplied from Billings (Mountain).  I believe this claim is without substantial merit.
The second claim is that virtually all television and radio broadcasts come from Bismarck.  In the era of cable television and satellite television, this claim is patently false.
The third claim is that the nearest commercial airport with passenger airline service is Bismarck.  This again is false.  For any remote destination, travel through Bismarck simply routes one to the Minneapolis hub.  A trip to the Dickinson airport (Mountain) will do the equivalent by routing travelers to the Denver hub.  Again, this claim is without merit.
The forth claim is that some of the residents in Mercer County commute to the Bismarck-Mandan area for work.  This is true.  What is conveniently omitted is that a larger number of residents in the Bismarck-Mandan area commute to Beulah to work at Dakota Gasification.  Yet I see no movement to convert Bismarck to Mountain time.  What I also find interesting is the final statement in this section that the main offices for the energy facilities are located in Bismarck (Central).  It has been a fact since the 1940’s that the energy facilities in Mercer County have operated on Central time.  The energy companies had their dispatch offices in Bismarck and to achieve continuity throughout their systems, all of the plants operated on Central time.  In fact, a Bismarck based utility has a generating unit in Sidney, MT that has operated on Central time since 1957.  I see no effort to move Sidney to Central time because of this.  As to the coal mines, as their customers (power plants) were operating on Central time, so they did also.  Again something that has been established practice for decades.
The next claim is that supplies for agriculture and the coal industry, come from Bismarck.  This apparently is meant to convey the feeling that this would somehow improve with a change to Central time.  Again this has occurred successfully for decades and a change in time zone to Central would have little if any benefit.  I also find it disturbing that this is basically a re-statement of the first point made in the request as if repeating the same statement will give it more validity.
The next claim is that residents travel to Bismarck for recreation, healthcare and other activities apparently inferring that a change to Central would make this easier.  I am protective of my hometown businesses and feel that anything that makes it easier to shop elsewhere other than in Mercer County is not a good move.  When I moved to Beulah in the late 70’s there were two lumberyards, two grocery stores, two automobile dealerships, and a movie theater.  There is now one lumberyard and one grocery store left.  I don’t want this trend to continue.
One item that was not brought up in the Mercer County Commission request was that of school scheduling.  There have been many comments locally about how much better it would be if Mercer County went to Central to support school activities.  Looking at the 2009-2010 Beulah Girls Varsity basketball schedule as a typical example, currently Beulah plays seven (7) teams in the Central time zone and nine (9) teams in the Mountain time zone.  A change to Central time would change this to (8) and (8).  I cannot see where anyone could claim this is a substantial improvement.
In closing, I would ask the questions again, would the change to Central time from Mountain time address a problem or secure some kind of advantage?  In my opinion, the answer is no on both counts.  I would request that the U.S. Department of Transportation make the decision to keep Mercer County, North Dakota in the Mountain time zone.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2010-0046-0280/attachment_1.docx",

June 6, 2010

Mercer County should be on Central Time because most of us already live our lives on Central Time, whether we realize it or not.  Examples include the daily newspaper of choice (Bismarck Tribune), TV feeds (Bismarck or Minot for both local and cable service), radio (we only have 1 local radio station in the county), “big city” shopping (a vast majority go to Bismarck or Minot), transportation connections (Bismarck or Minot for planes, trains, or buses), and out of town school events.  Not to mention that the largest employers in the county (the mines and power plants) already operate on Central Time because their headquarters are yes, in Bismarck or other Central Time zone cities.  And the local businesses are inconvenienced because most of their suppliers and many customers live on Central Time.  

Then there’s the common sense issue.  This time of year the sun rises at 4:30 a.m. local (Mountain) time.  Who needs the sun at that early hour?  It’s still the middle of the night, people!!  Which means it sets at the relatively early hour of 9:00.  Wouldn’t we rather have that extra hour of sunlight in the evening when the majority of us are still awake, instead of at 4:30 in the morning when the non-vampires are trying to sleep?

I haven’t heard a good argument yet supporting Mountain Time.  Farmers will always get their work done by the same amount of sunlight hours.  Whether their watch says 10:00 or 12:00 or 2:00 makes no difference in the amount of sunlight in a day.  And for parts or other business, stores adjust their hours to meet the needs of their customers.  Williston, which is 100 miles west of here and borders Mountain Time to the West and South, seems to manage quite well on Central Time.  As does the rest of northwest North Dakota.

I think the only argument that fits the Mountain Time supporters is that people are resistant to any change, even if it’s in the right direction.",,,,,,,

A friend of mine was in the area and had a business appointment at one of the area power plants.  He ask me, ""what time we are on?""  I said, ""good question.  We are officially on Mtn time but the plants operate on central time.  I guess I would rather be an hour early than an hour late.""  If he would not have asked me and just looked at the time on his cell phone he could have been late.

The schools are losing an hour of precious educational time by sending kids to activities in the Central time zone.  Businesses are losing about 3 hours a day doing business with many central-time zone businesses.

I believe that by changing time zones for Mercer County does not solve the time issue problem as a whole.  It merely moves the problem to the next counties to the west.  Also, I believe that time zones were initially set up to correspond to the sun as it moves accross this planet.  By changing Mercer County to Central time this no longer holds true.  Individuals who want the time changed may do so by changing their schedules. (ie. opening a place of business at 8 a.m. instead of 9 a.m. which infact if Central time were initiated, is the time they will then open anyway.)

It seems that the time change has become an issue of conveniences for individuals and business rather than considering the reason for time zones.  Conveniences for some will make inconveniences for others.  So again, I urge the DOT to let Mercer County remain on Mountain Time.",,,,,,,

We were both raised on farms in Mercer County.  Our parents didn't own wrist watches at the time they began homesteading and used the sun to tell time.  When the sun was straight south and shadows were straight north it was 12:00 noon and time to go home for dinner.  This year (2010) on March 20th the sun came up straight East at 7:00 Mountain Daylight Time and set at 7:00 Mountain Daylight time.  If we wouldn't have Daylight Savings Time it would be right for the sun to rise at 6 a.m. in the East and set straight in the  West at 6 p.m.  It doesn't make any sense to us to have the sun rise at 8 a.m. and set at 8 p.m. if we were to  change to Central time.  We have always watched the evening news on TV at 9 p.m.  and we would like to keep on watching the news at 9 p.m. because 10 p.m. is much to late.

Business claim they will benefit from this change.  They don't realize that it leaves some workers with less shopping or doing business time.  Especially banks or clinics which close at 5.  So how do they think there is a gain when they will loose business.
Farms.........more time in the feild.  Well get up earlier.  By changing the time does not give you more time in the feild.  8, 10, 12 hours is still 8, 10, or 12 hours no matter what time zone. 
Take a look at Starck County.  That was put on a ballot and voted NO!

I teach at the high school and in early January, sunrise would be around 8:33 Central Time.  I have to be at school before 8:00 so I'd be walking when it is still fairly dark.  Many of the schools that we do play basketball with are west of us (in Mountain Time) and many businesses are closed by 4:00 p.m. currently.  Many plant workers are off before that time now and can make it to the post office or inside the bank.  Also, from my experience with teenagers, they tend to be more alert later in the day and not early risers.  It would be like school starting at 7:20 now.

I am a school bus driver and with MT the morning routes are driven in daylight therefore - fewer educational hours are missed waiting for daylight & better visibility.
The sundial proves it is true time.
I retire & rise early & watch 9pm news (10 pm news gets too late). 
Prefer watching a movie from 7-9 pm over 8-10 pm.
MT time would give farmers 1extra business hour later in the day than CT for parts runs.
When I am at work and on lunch break I'm able to place personal business calls to businesses on CT because they are back from their lunch break.
I was raised on central time but I prefer mountain time.

              I believe mercer county should be left on Mountain Time. My reason being that I work until 3:00 mt pm. and like to see high school sportsing events. When the event starts at 4:00 mt I can still make the games on time. If central comes in I will no longer be able to make the games on time unless the starting times of the games is 1 hour later which I do not believe will happen. Also those of us that work at Dakota Gasification Plant that get off work at 3:00 mt pm. can still get to school on time to pick up our children. This is very important to alot of us who work the day shift.
           Now being that Billings and Stark counties voted for Mountain time it would not make any difference to the school systems as for we compete both with the east that is on central time and the west which is on mountain time.
    Also being a farmer we can work later in the evening and still make in for repairs if needed.

We are used to adding or subtracting 1 to figure out the time, we learned that in the first grade without a calculator!  Thanks, Deen Brecht",,,,,,,

It is good for the plant workers of this area to get off work in time to pick up their children from school and be home when they get off.  This works great as the people work on central time and live on mountain time.  People here are used to changing time zones when they travel to Bismarck.  It's not a problem and many people like this zone and want to keep it, including me!",,,,,,,

1.  Require FAA to improve its training of Aviation safety Inspectors.   This training should be accomplished by the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City not contracted out to the persons that FAA regulates.
2.  Return to a higher standard in initial and recurrent training of all FAA designated Examiners.  Designated Examiners conduct at least 80% of all pilot and mechanic certification.   The minimal cost savings to DOT/FAA is approximately $120,000,000 per year by utilizing Designated Examiners.  
3.  Discontinue the use of non civil oriented persons to act as Aviation Safety Inspectors in any capacity.  All Inspectors must possess civil certification with commensurate experience before they are assigned to positions of oversight in Washington DC or any other management capacity.	This practice has significanlty damaged the professionalism in Flight Standards.",,,,,,,

1.  Reduce the $1,000,000 minimum for applications proposing planning activities in rural communities.  Too often, rural communities leap at development / construction initiatives without conducting the best practice of completing realistic planning, feasibility, and cost-benefit analysis activities.  A $1,000,000 minimum far exceeds the costs of typical planning needs for a small rural community, and discourages rural communities from undertaking the best practice of careful planning.  As a concrete example, the rural City of Saxman, Alaska has been quoted a cost of $250,000 to complete all planning activities for the development of its waterfront.  This is largest economic development planning project conceivable within our community, and the responsible ""next step,"" yet the total costs are 25% of your required minimum.  A $1 million planning project seems far too enormous for any community that can reasonably be called ""rural.""

2.  Remove (or reduce) cost-benefit analysis requirements for rural communities proposing planning activities.  Completion of a cost-benefit analysis is an essential planning activity.  Many rural communities cannot afford to have planners or analysists on staff who are capable of producing a responsible, realistic cost-benefit analysis; hence the need to apply for planning funding, and the usefulness of TIGER/HUD planning funding. By requiring rural communities to provide a cost-benefit analysis for a successful planning proposal, you are essentially asking applicants to demonstrate that they have planning capacity already before they can receive planning funding.  This requirement seems to contradict the intention of the funding; to provide assistance to rural communities who cannot afford to foster economic growth without special outside assistance.",,,,,,,

1)	Guidance on the development of the benefit-cost analysis included in the interim notice indicates a requirement to include the cost of long-term maintenance and operations for newly constructed facilities.  However, this requirement unfairly penalizes an applicant agency’s need to program such maintenance to preserve or prolong the functionality of facilities constructed with grant funding.  (Conversely, an applicant’s stated intent to skimp on maintenance would yield better benefit-cost analysis results, but would result in premature deterioration of the funded facility.  Surely, this is counter to the intent of the enabling legislation to seek an investment in the nation’s infrastructure.)  This is especially unfair considering that federal funding generally cannot be used for maintenance and operations functions, and such long-term costs are often borne by applicant agencies merely as a matter of agency function.  Guidance should be modified to exclude all such maintenance and operations costs, except in cases where the nature of such future activities significantly deviates from an agency’s current function or mission, and would result in an agency’s need to significantly invest in new types of maintenance and operations functions.
2)	The requirements set forth for the documentation of benefit-cost analyses are extreme, and are more onerous than those associated with the initial TIGER Grant program.  If the guidance for analysis documentation were followed as presented in the interim notice, it would likely consume a large portion (if not all) of the 25 pages allocated for the entire application, to the exclusion of other vitally relevant material.  It is also apparent that most local public agencies would be unable to meet the threshold for analyses defined by the interim notice guidance using in-house resources.  Given the intent of the grant program, this is unreasonable.  Consideration should be given to scaling back the documentary requirements for the benefit-cost analysis, and providing agencies with guidance that could yield suitable benefit-cost analyses at substantially lower cost to the applicant agencies.",,,,,,,

Mr. Ray LaHood
Secretary of Transportation
U.S. Department of Transportation
1200 New Jersey Ave. SE
Docket Number DOT-OST-2010-0076
Washington, D.C. 20590

SUBJECT:	Request for Comments on Interim Notice of Funding Availability for TIGER II Discretionary Grant Program

Dear Secretary LaHood:

Thank you for requesting comments on the proposed selection criteria for the National Infrastructure Investment grants, also know as the TIGER II Discretionary Grant Program, authorized under the FY 2010 Appropriations Act. We are pleased to submit the following comments on behalf of the New South Park Bridge Coalition, which was formed to tap broad community support in an effort to secure funding for a new South Park Bridge.

Our coalition supports your proposal to conduct a multi-agency grant evaluation process involving the U.S. Department of Transportation, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Environmental Protection Agency. We feel that replacement of the South Park Bridge will meet a number of goals important to these agencies. For example, the project would improve public safety and mobility by replacing the lowest-rated high-traffic bridge in the state of Washington. It also would support community development by serving the area that has our state’s greatest concentration of economically distressed neighborhoods. And the bridge spans an identified Superfund site, so its replacement before the planned clean-up would contribute to restoration of the river environment.  

Our suggestions for clarifying and strengthening the criteria for the TIGER II Discretionary Grant Program are as follows:

Job Creation and Economic Stimulus
We are pleased to see that the TIGER II funding criteria continue to give high priority to projects that will create jobs and stimulate economic activity. We also recognize that infrastructure projects can have an impact on local economies during construction, and believe the grant criteria should give weight to projects that include measures to sustain jobs and businesses in local communities while a project is being built. Examples of such temporary measures are: assistance to businesses, community marketing programs that might include signage and advertising, neighborhood access improvements such as signal upgrades, and transportation services such as shuttles that would improve customers’ access to business districts. 


State of Good Repair
Our nation’s infrastructure replacement and preservation needs are increasing as roads and bridges across the U.S. are approaching the end of their useful lives. The federal government has established objective standards for rating the condition of transportation structures. We recommend that the TIGER II evaluation criteria use these standards to help ensure that the program’s grant funds are focused on fixing structures that are most in need of replacement. The criteria should place a particular emphasis on bridges with extremely low sufficiency ratings.

Freight Access to Key U.S. Industries
Finally, we are pleased to see that the criteria will weigh the ability of projects to enhance our nation’s economic competitiveness. Our region is a major center for international trade, so we are especially aware of the need to maintain or improve the transportation of freight to sea ports and airports. Our nation’s export- and import-dependent industries depend on port access—and reliable corridors to airports are particularly important because of the time-sensitive nature of air shipment. The King County International Airport—located near the South Park Bridge—is used by The Boeing Company, United Parcel Service, BAX Global, and the Military Flight Center. The TIGER II grant criteria should give priority to designated high-volume truck routes that have a clear link to our national and international competitiveness. 

Thank you for moving quickly to implement the TIGER II Discretionary Grant Program.  We appreciate the opportunity to comment and look forward to submitting our proposal for replacing the South Park Bridge.

Sincerely,

Geoff Belau

This comment is submitted on May 6, 2010.  

Page 11, Line 3, of the ""Interim Notice of Funding Availability for the Department of Transportation’s National Infrastructure Investments under the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for 2010; and Request for Comments"" states, ""The Recovery Act required DOT to give priority to projects that were expected to be completed by February 17, 2012. The FY 2010 Appropriations Act does not include any similar requirements for the TIGER II Discretionary Grants, although TIGER II funds are only available for obligation through September 30, 2012.""  Please clarify what the definition of ""obligation"" is as it relates to this grant.  Does it relate to the deadline of the DOT to award funds to a specific project or does it relate to the recipient's request for reimbursment of expenditures?  

It is our understanding that the new TIGER grants do not have a required expend by date.  Is this correct?",,,,,,,

Document number:  DOT-OST-2010-0076

Regarding a multi-agency grant for ""Community Challenge Planning Grants"" we submit the following suggestions to assist low income persons to obtain education, training, and jobs.
We would hope your program would permit Housing Authorities to  identify, organize, and motivate residents to seek educational opportunities leading to job placement and the retension of such through a program coordinating the efforts of the local Housing Authority and the local public transportation agency.  
Funding required should support the Housing Authority's identification and motivation program as well as permitting location of a central pickup facility for the programs residents going both to schools and to jobs.  In addition, funding should support acquisitions of public transit vehicles that would provide status and educational opportunities such as use of wireless devices on-board while traveling to and from school and the job location.  The project should allow for the use of the latest technologies not only to provide interest and motivation, but to instill the idea of continuous use of one's time in the working world.
We propose that all options be available and open in the proposal stage, the evaluation stage, and in funding to permit the greatest latitude in the scope and execution of the project.  A sufficient follow-up period should be allowed to provide for the long term effectivenes of the program on the individual participants.",,,,,,,

Re: Comments on Docket number DOT–OST–2010–0076

Dear Sir or Madam:

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the guidance and criteria for the TIGER II Discretionary Grants program. Maine Audubon works to conserve Maine’s wildlife and wildlife habitat by engaging people of all ages in education, conservation and action. We are the largest wildlife conservation organization in Maine, and are widely respected for our science-based conservation and environmental education. We are leaders in road ecology in Maine and work to reduce the impact of roads on wildlife and habitat, and to reduce future impacts by incorporating wildlife conservation into transportation planning. This important federal funding opportunity will allow projects such as wildlife crossing structures to succeed, by maintaining safe passages across highways and through our nation’s vast transportation infrastructure. 

We appreciate the shared emphasis in this second round of TIGER grants on economic contribution in the short term and on overall contribution to the economy and ecology in the long term. Maine Audubon supports projects that:
•	avoid road development in wildlife habitats and environmentally sensitive places, 
•	modify existing roads where necessary to allow wildlife to cross, 
•	minimize impact on the surrounding environment, 
•	use innovative strategies to pursue the long-term outcome of environmental sustainability, 
•	have significant contributions to the national and regional economies, socially, economically, and ecologically. 

We strongly support the inclusion of improved habitat connectivity in the primary selection criteria of long-term outcomes. This consideration is consistent with the recommendations of the Western Governors’ Association (WGA) Wildlife Corridors Initiative Report and the mission of the WGA Wildlife Council, as well as with Section 6001 of SAFETEA-LU, which requires transportation planners to consult with natural resource agencies by comparing transportation and conservation plans, and by discussing potential environmental mitigation activities. 

Maine Audubon also supports the secondary selection criteria of partnerships and innovation, which will effectively add to a project’s competitiveness for funding. Projects that improve aquatic and/or wildlife habitat connectivity incorporate innovative and creative highway designs while creating partnerships across federal, state, and local government agencies and a broad range of non-governmental organizations, as well as build collaborations between state transportation and natural resource agencies. These criteria will contribute towards achieving significant impacts in environmental sustainability on a national scale.  

In Maine, the areas that would most benefit from TIGER II funding include: southern Maine which has the highest level of wildlife diversity in the state and the greatest habitat at risk due to development pressures and sprawl; Maine’s northern forest which is the largest remaining forested area in the eastern United States; and Maine’s waterways which are home to the federally endangered Atlantic Salmon and the last and largest healthy population of native Brook Trout in the eastern United States.

We ask that you provide an improved and clarified rating system for how projects funded by the TIGER II grants meet the primary and secondary selection criteria. Additionally, with consideration to the administration’s emphasis on climate change mitigation and adaptation, we ask that you factor these priorities into the proposal evaluation process. 

Thank you for your careful consideration of these comments; we look forward to reviewing the grant selection process.

Sincerely,



Barbara Charry

ARC commends USDOT for taking a more holistic approach to planning through its expressed interest in combining the evaluation and selection process for TIGER II Planning Grants with HUD’s Community Challenge Grant Program.  We concur with the sustainability and livability concepts as defined under both programs and believe having various disciplines and agencies participate on the review teams will strengthen the quality of selected projects.

However, certain elements of the programs do not align well and could make a coordinated review and selection process challenging.  The TIGER II program emphasizes large-scale projects that provide widespread benefit to an entire metro area, a state or the nation.  But the HUD program, while not specific on the scope of desired geographic impacts, places priority on more localized livability projects due to the nature of the program itself.  And while TIGER II requires a detailed benefit/cost analysis for projects, this is not mandated for the HUD program.  The level to which a planning grant would need to address benefit/cost issues is unclear, so this disconnect across programs may or may not be significant.

If the process of selecting planning programs are officially combined, ARC believes that the specific application requirements must be consistent and seamless to ensure sponsors are able to prepare competitive and worthy submittals for consideration.  Because each planning dollar would be expected to accomplish the simultaneous goals and objectives of two programs, we would support increasing the overall level of funding available for planning activities.  Finally, ARC recommends giving priority funding consideration to areas which already have robust livability programs in place and have the ability and willingness to leverage these additional resources into “on the ground” results efficiently.",,,,,,,

Docket Number DOT-OST-2010-0076
Washington, D.C. 20590

SUBJECT:	Request for Comments on Interim Notice of Funding Availability for TIGER II Discretionary Grant Program

Dear Secretary LaHood:

Thank you for requesting comments on the proposed selection criteria for the National Infrastructure Investment grants, also know as the TIGER II Discretionary Grant Program, authorized under the FY 2010 Appropriations Act.  I write to submit comments on behalf of a new South Park Bridge.  I am a resident and property owner in the South Park neighborhood, and a retired small business owner.

I support your proposal to conduct a multi-agency grant evaluation process involving the U.S. Department of Transportation, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Environmental Protection Agency. I feel that replacement of the South Park Bridge will meet a number of goals important to these agencies. From my home, I can see the traffic using this bridge, which is the lowest-rated high-traffic bridge in the state of Washington.  I know how many times a day it is used by ambulances, fire engines, and police cars responding to emergencies.  I can see the heavy traffic at lunchtime, bringing workers at large companies across the river to our neighborhood restaurants.  In my economically distressed neighborhood, this patronage for our restaurants and services is critical for their survival. I also see the wildlife, including eagles, osprey, herons, salmon, and sea lions, that struggle to survive in this designated Superfund river, and I dream of the day when they will flourish due to its planned cleanup.  Replacement of the bridge before the clean-up will contribute to restoration of the river environment.  

Job Creation and Economic Stimulus
I am pleased to see that the TIGER II funding criteria continue to give high priority to projects that will create jobs and stimulate economic activity. The closing of our old bridge, scheduled for June 30, will have a terrible effect on our local economy.  Temporary measures such as assistance to businesses, community marketing programs such as signage and advertising, neighborhood access improvements such as signal upgrades, and transportation services such as shuttles that would improve customers’ access to business districts will help. In addition, the presence of construction crews working on the new bridge will add patronage to our restaurants to help offset the loss from across the river.


State of Good Repair
Our existing bridge is in such terrible condition that it must be closed June 30.  Surely this must give it much higher priority than other, less urgent projects.

Freight Access to Key U.S. Industries
Over the years, I have observed the growth of manufacturing businesses in my neighborhood.  They produce high quality products that are sold throughout the world.  I see the trucks delivering supplies to these businesses, and carrying their products away for shipment to customers.  Across the river, from King County International Airport, I see the departure of planes from The Boeing Company, United Parcel Service, BAX Global, and the Military Flight Center. The TIGER II grant criteria should give priority to designated high-volume truck routes that have a clear link to our national and international competitiveness. 

Thank you for moving quickly to implement the TIGER II Discretionary Grant Program.  I appreciate the opportunity to comment. 

Sincerely,



Deborah McNeil

The most logical primary applicant for this effort would be the regional RC&D (USDA-NRCS non-profit arm).  However, it's unlcear whether an RC&D could act as the recipient and grant manager for a proposal of this nature under the current terms of relationship between the TIGER II Discretionary Grant and the HUD Community Challenge Planning Grant.  Without more information, I am unable to tell whether these activities would be funded under the HUG Grant, where the RC&D would be an eligibile applicant.  I believe that these activities would be eligible unde the TIGER II Grant, but it looks like the RC&D may not be an eligibile applicant.  Is there a chance that ""non-profits"" or some category that would include RC&Ds could be eligible for the TIGER II Grant, or at least the Planning Grant component of the TIGER II program?  Alternatively, could it be clear that comprehensive TDM programs are eligble under the HUD grant programs as part of the Partnership for Sustainable Communities?

Subject:  Comments on DOT Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGERII) and HUD Community Challenge Program Discretionary Planning Grant Criteria


The Urban Land Use and Transportation Center (ULTRANS) at the University of California (UC), Davis, Institute of Transportation Studies is pleased to submit comments on the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) TIGERII and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Community Challenge Program Discretionary Grant Request for Comments on the Program and Criteria.  ULTRANS is providing the following recommendations for DOTs and HUDs consideration in adopting their Grant Programs.  These comments are specific to the planning grant programs:

The stated eligible applicants cited in the interim notice (``Eligible Applicants'' for TIGER II Discretionary Grants are State and local governments, including U.S. territories, tribal governments, transit agencies, port authorities, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), other political subdivisions of State or local governments, and multi-State or multi-jurisdictional groups applying through a single lead applicant (for multi-jurisdictional groups, each member of the group, including the lead applicant, must be an otherwise eligible applicant as defined in this paragraph)”) does not specifically include universities as eligible applicants.  ULTRANS recommends that the eligible entities be broadened to specifically include universities whose work will enable early measurable advances with the development and implementation of next-generation tools for federal policy and infrastructure planning including integrated land use, transportation, economic modeling work and science based  best practices like those ULTRANS is developing.  These advances are critical for the Obama Administration to achieve its' stated overall goals to successfully show accountability.  Inclusion of tools and best practices is also critical to local and regional level evaluation and implementation of the Sustainability Partnerships Livability Principles.  Local and regional entities in California have acknowledged they need to know how statewide GHG/land use/transport policy will discretely affect their regions overall economy and environmental justice performance, and how to resolve differences in interregional trips.   The tools and information being developed at ULTRANS will enable communities to better grasp these issues and concerns to formulate more effective policies and projects.
Another critical role that universities play in achieving the outcomes intended by these grant programs is the leadership in getting MPOs to band together to tackle common challenges.  In California, this is evidenced by the work that ULTRANS has done to partner and facilitate the joint effort by the 8 MPOs in the San Joaquin Valley to tackle their land use, transportation and economic issues.  Another example is, as a result of consultation with the 4 largest MPOs in California, each MPO is developing the same kind of integrated land use, transportation and economic model to comply with SB 375 requirements. 
In addition, universities are increasingly becoming “centers of excellence” for collaboration between states, regions and local partners to efficiently pool resources to advance major policy implementation efforts.  For this reason, universities should be eligible applicants and supported for the purpose of advancing national objectives through regional or nationally focused centers.  This is further explained in subsequent comments.
The interim notice requests comments on the proposed selection criteria and guidance for awarding funds. 

ULTRANS supports the joint agency evaluation and award process that encourages and rewards more holistic planning efforts and result in better projects being built with Federal dollars.  
 

ULTRANS recommends that planning activities should be eligible that support decision-making about which local, regional or state strategies and improvements provide the most benefit given the known tradeoffs between economic, environmental, equity and other outcomes. Therefore, eligibility for this program should be broadened to include the development of integrated planning tools and information that help local, regional and state governments better evaluate their proposed alternative strategies for sustainability. 

The interim notice states DOT and HUD would like to invite comments about whether the differences in eligibility should be maintained and, if so, how it might be managed in a joint selection process. 

ULTRANS recommends broadening the eligibility of both programs to include a broader range of applicants and planning activities, including universities and non-profits, so that partnerships can be formed or enhanced to support local, regional and state objectives and collaborative decision-making “to foster reform and reduce barriers to achieve affordable, economically vital, and sustainable communities” as stated in HUDs Community Challenge Planning Grants.”  

In addition, ULTRANS recommends broadening the eligibility for the grants as stated in order for potential grantees to improve linkages between sectors, similar to the kind of partnership the three federal “Partnership” agency programs desire, to be able to align transportation, housing, economic development and land use planning.  

The interim notice states DOT and HUD would like to receive comments on the evaluation method that should be used for a combined planning grant process, in terms of selection criteria and goals. Also, feedback is invited on funding categories and where the overlap between DOT and HUD's program might be applied most effectively. 

UC Davis recommends that the evaluation should consider the degree to which different sectors (transportation and housing, economic development and land use, health, etc.) and outcomes (economy, environment, equity, sustainability, etc.) are integrated in the proposed planning effort including data, analysis and solutions to explicitly address the tradeoffs between different scenarios to achieve holistic planning goals and outcomes.

The funding categories established should reflect emphasis on rewarding those applicants’ plans and projects that overlap between the DOT and HUD program (greater synergy).

Thank you for the opportunity for ULTRANS to comment on the proposed federal grant programs.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2010-0076-0043/attachment_1.pdf",

Docket Number DOT-OST-2010-0076
Washington, D.C. 20590

SUBJECT:	Request for Comments on Interim Notice of Funding Availability for TIGER II Discretionary Grant Program

Dear Secretary LaHood:

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed selection criteria for the National Infrastructure Investment grants, also know as the TIGER II Discretionary Grant Program.  The original TIGER Grant Program provided much welcomed funding for local projects throughout the nation at a time when revenue for local governments is waning.  I know that the TIGER II Program will meet the same success in helping jurisdictions like ours.

King County will be applying for TIGER II funding for our most critical project, replacement of the South Park Bridge.  We believe this project will fulfill multiple federal agency goals.  It would improve public safety and mobility by replacing the lowest-rated high-traffic bridge in Washington; would support the economy and livability of an area that has our state’s greatest concentration of economically distressed neighborhoods; and would contribute to the cleanup of the lower Duwamish River, an identified Superfund site.  

We encourage you to consider the following suggestions for evaluating all project submissions to ensure the selection of projects that best serve the public good:

Job Creation and Economic Stimulus
The Tiger II funding criteria should continue to prioritize projects that create jobs and stimulate economic activity.  In addition, we are concerned about the impact that infrastructure projects will have on local economies during construction as transportation is a key link to a community’s vitality.  King County suggests that the grant criteria give preference to projects that include temporary programs to help sustain jobs and businesses in communities adjacent to a project during construction.  Such programs could include providing assistance to businesses, supporting community marketing programs, improving neighborhood access through traffic signal upgrades, and supporting transportation services to sustain access to business districts. 

State of Good Repair
Across the nation, roads and bridges are approaching the end of their useful lives, and the cost of preserving and replacing outdated infrastructure is rising.  In evaluating the TIGER II grant applications, federal agencies should rely on objective standards that have been developed for rating the condition of transportation structures, such as the National Bridge Inspections Standards.  This will ensure that the program’s grant funds are used for the projects that are most critical for public safety.  It is especially important that the criteria prioritize bridges with extremely low sufficiency ratings.

Freight Access to Key U.S. Industries
We are pleased to see that the criteria will consider the ability of projects to enhance our nation’s economic competitiveness.  The criteria should prioritize projects that are critical for system capacity to maintain or improve freight mobility to sea ports, airports and local commercial traffic.  Access to ports is critical to export- and import-dependent industries.  Reliable and efficient connections to airports are especially important for time-sensitive air freight transportation.  We strongly urge you to specifically prioritize high-volume truck routes in the TIGER II criteria.

National Defense
One criterion not included in the original TIGER program or in TIGER II is support for our country’s national defense and security priorities.  We encourage DOT to consider including criteria that acknowledges and prioritizes projects that enhance the national defense preparedness of our country.  Specifically, we recommend USDOT prioritize projects that improve access to facilities that provide critical defense equipment and components. 

Planning Grant Program
In response to specific issues raised in your request for comment, King County supports coupling the evaluation process and funding for the USDOT and HUD planning programs.  A multi-agency evaluation and award process is consistent with both agencies’ participation in the “Partnership for Sustainable Communities.”  The evaluation method used to determine TIGER II funding should parallel evaluation criteria that are used in the HUD Community Challenge Grant Program. Since HUD planning grant funds are directed towards local planning activities to support future transportation investments, TIGER II planning grant funds should support projects that are ready for or near implementation. TIGER II funding also should support projects that would directly result in significant private or public investments.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the TIGER Discretionary Grant Program, and for moving quickly to disseminate the TIGER II funding at a time when our economy is slowly recovering.  We look forward to submitting our proposal for replacement of the South Park Bridge.

Sincerely,



Dow Constantine
King County Executive

“Projects in Rural Areas
The FY 2010 Appropriations Act directs that not less than $140 million of the funds provided for TIGER II Discretionary Grants are to be used for projects in rural areas. DOT is generally defining “rural area” as any area not in an Urbanized Area, as such term is defined by the Census Bureau, and will consider a project to be in a rural area if all or a material portion of a project is located in a rural area. For projects located in rural areas the FY 2010 Appropriation Act does not require matching funds (although the statute does direct DOT to give priority to projects, including projects located in rural areas, for which Federal funding is required to complete an overall financing package that includes non-Federal sources of funds) and the minimum grant size is $1 million.” http://www.dot.gov/recovery/ost/tigerii/

Docket # DOT-OST-2010-0076

Responding to DOT's request for comments for TIGER II Grants, especially those set aside for ""rural areas"", we would like to offer the following suggestions.

Latitude should be allowed for the development and testing of vehicles that would be especially designed to operate in rural areas.  Many rural areas do not have paved roads.  Tribal areas are included in this type situation.  Regular transit vehicles, currently on the market do not work here.

Rural vehicles would require the following specifications:
High approach and departure angles, front and back.
Good rear traction for dirt and sand roads.
Maneuverability
Low profile to avioid overhanging obstructions.
Durability for prolonged use on rough roads.
Extended life-cycle time frame to mimimize life-cycle cost.

For best results, this development and testing should be done by rural transit agencies, on site and under actual operating conditions to insure the greatest usability of the final product.  Extension of current innovative research projects such as FTA's Advanced Rural Low Floor Vehicle Project should be allowable under the TIGER II Program. 
Evaluation criteria should give weighted consideration to the extend that a project will have innovative impact especially to the needs of rural communities, including Tribal areas, nationwide.

Thank you for your consideration of our thoughts.",,,,,,,

Re: Comments on Docket number DOT–OST–2010–0076

Dear Sir or Madam:

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the guidance and criteria for the TIGER II Discretionary Grants program. American Wildlands is focused on maintaining habitat connectivity throughout the Northern Rocky Mountains of the United States. Our Safe Passages Program seeks to reduce the impact of roads and highways on wildlife and habitat, and to reduce future impacts by incorporating wildlife conservation into transportation planning. This important federal funding opportunity will allow projects such as wildlife crossing structures to succeed, by maintaining safe passages across highways and through our nation’s vast transportation infrastructure. 

We appreciate the shared emphasis in this second round of TIGER grants on economic contribution in the short term and on overall contribution to the economy and ecology in the long term. American Wildlands supports projects that:
•	avoid road development in wildlife habitats and environmentally sensitive places, 
•	modify existing roads where necessary to allow wildlife to cross, 
•	minimize impact on the surrounding environment, 
•	use innovative strategies to pursue the long-term outcome of environmental sustainability, 
•	have significant contributions to the national and regional economies, socially, economically, and ecologically. 

We strongly support the inclusion of improved habitat connectivity in the primary selection criteria of long-term outcomes. This consideration is consistent with the recommendations of the Western Governors’ Association (WGA) Wildlife Corridors Initiative Report and the mission of the WGA Wildlife Council, as well as with Section 6001 of SAFETEA-LU, which requires transportation planners to consult with natural resource agencies by comparing transportation and conservation plans, and by discussing potential environmental mitigation activities. 

American Wildlands also supports the secondary selection criteria of partnerships and innovation, which will effectively add to a project’s competitiveness for funding. Projects that improve aquatic and/or wildlife habitat connectivity incorporate innovative and creative highway designs while creating partnerships across federal, state, and local government agencies and a broad range of non-governmental organizations, as well as build collaborations between state transportation and natural resource agencies. These criteria will contribute towards achieving significant impacts in environmental sustainability on a national scale.  

We encourage the engagement of the Montana Department of Transportation and the Idaho Transportation Department in identifying projects where these funds would best facilitate transportation mitigations to protect wildlife and connect habitats.

We ask that you provide an improved and clarified rating system for how projects funded by the TIGER II grants meet the primary and secondary selection criteria. Additionally, with consideration to the administration’s emphasis on climate change mitigation and adaptation, we ask that you factor these priorities into the proposal evaluation process. 

Thank you for your careful consideration of these comments; we look forward to reviewing the grant selection process.

Sincerely,


Dylan Taylor

1.	I note from the background (pg 21698 middle column near the end) that the USDOT has funds available for award and oversight of the program. It would be, in my opinion, wise to reserve much of these funds to monitor the projects once awarded.  The Interim notice does discuss the need to monitor projects but gives no details on how this will be done.  Given that both the USDOT and the successful applicants have incentives to report successful grants, it would be advisable to have data on these projects collected by a non government organization and then have this data analyzed by a different non government organization.  It would also be wise to acknowledge up front that data collection on the success of projects is no easy thing. For example, while the Bureau of Labor Statistics has pretty good numbers for county and metropolitan employment, getting valid numbers for employment at finer geographic scales is difficult. In addition, having identified employers who have expanded production and employment subsequent to the project, it is difficult to determine if these employers would have done so without the project or would have done so in a different location. 
2.	In many places the notice makes the point that projects should produce long term economic growth (or long term growth or sustainable growth, etc.).  This makes many of the paragraphs on Benefit-Cost Analysis vs. Economic Impact Analysis (pg 21710 left and middle columns) difficult to understand.  While the notice is surely correct to recognize that a benefit-cost analysis is not an economic impact analysis, this point is not in dispute.  The notice also makes clear that applicants need to submit a benefit cost analysis. Again this point is not in dispute. What is unclear is how applicants can address the need to show long term economic growth without economic impact analysis.  Even more fundamentally, the last paragraph of this section states that applicants should avoid using software packages to that designed to produce economic impact analysis (the sentence after this somewhat softens this ‘should avoid’ statement ).  Given the desire of the USDOT for showing long term economic growth and the fact that some software packages show both benefit cost and economic impact analysis (as separate and distinct reports), this statement is so bizarre as to be arbitrary and capricious.   Indeed, if long term economic growth is to be undertaken and may not be done with software packages, then how should it be done?  
3.	The Benefit-Cost Analysis vs. Economic Impact Analysis has many good points about avoidance of spurious counting of real estate investments. These apply to both Benefit Cost Analysis and Economic Impact Analysis and should be a separate section.",,,,,,,

The interpretation of the statutory language to distribute funds for ""projects that will have a significant impact on the Nation, a metropolitan area, or a region"" is biased towards projects that have more impact on the Nation as opposed to a metropolitan area or region. This is evidenced by the use of evaluation criteria (e.g., Long-Term Outcomes/ Economic Competitiveness) and evaluation methodology (the proposed benefit-cost analysis defines ""society"" on which costs and benefits are to be assessed to be ""all residents of the United States"").  In this regard, transit projects will not compete well.  We suggest putting more emphasis on mobility to better address metropolitan and regional needs (some of which could also have an impact on the Nation). 
 
2. We recommend separate evaluation methods for DOT and HUD planning grant programs, as opposed to combining them. Although we recognize there are similar goals between the two programs, the funding available for each agency is relatively small and the combined criteria may add unnecessary complexity to the process.
 
3. We need clarification as to whether any TIGER II TIFIA Payments awarded to a state will be counted towards the $150 million maximum that can be awarded to projects in a single state. We also need clarification if TIGER II TIFIA Payments awarded to projects in rural areas will be counted towards meeting the minimum of $140 million set by statutory language. 
 
4. We seek clarification on the eligible applicants for TIGER II Discretionary Grants.      Can an eligible applicant apply directly as a pass-through agency to an agency that is not an eligible applicant?  
 
5. We disagree with the proposed Secondary Selection Criteria, and the overall need for it. We propose to move the ""Jurisdictional & Stakeholder"" measure under the ""Partnership"" criterion to the Primary Selection Criterion.   Non-federal financial commitment and relevant project partnerships should receive a higher weight in the evaluation of applications, particularly to reward metropolitan areas and regions where residents voted to increase taxes to support and advance the implementation of transportation projects.   On the other hand, the ""Innovation"" secondary criterion should not be considered as part of the evaluation criteria as it could result in biases against more conventional, but highly needed projects. 
 
6. We disagree with the proposed ""State of Good Repair"" Long-term Outcome of the Primary Selection Criteria.   This outcome is based against new projects, focusing on rehabilitation and maintenance projects. The DOT should not discriminate against eligible capital projects, consistent with statutory language authorizing National Infrastructure Investments. The proposed language may have the unintended outcome to discriminate against transit projects. For example, transit projects may not have a stream of revenue to cover all operating expenditures, but are needed.   Page 21699 of the FR Notice provides additional information relevant to revenues in DOT's proposed assessment of the ""State of Good Repair"" outcome. 
 
7. The DOT should give priority in its evaluation methodology for projects located in areas designated by EPA as non attainment for ozone, as well in those metropolitan areas and in regions with high levels of traffic congestion.
 
8. Although statutory language does not require a local match for projects in rural areas, we recommend committed local match to be included among the evaluation criteria for projects in rural areas.   DOT only suggest that ""priority"" will be given to such projects, but without any further details on the weight this ""priority"" will carry in the evaluation of applications. 
 
9. Although we acknowledge the difficulty in assigning scores to the applications as a result of the evaluations, we disagree with the proposal to assign ratings (four ratings ranging from highly recommended to negative) to each of the selection criteria.               If DOT implements its proposed methodology, we request that ratings also be provided to the components/outcomes of each criterion. Without such approach, it will be very subjective for the evaluation teams to re-assess projects and identify those that should be most highly rated.  While the proposed methodology by DOT is acceptable at the screening level of applications, we recommend that the most highly rated applications be ultimately scored.

I agree it is time to adjust the PNW guidelines for inflation. But more importantly, I believe one's defined benefit pension plan should not be included in PNW calculations, just as the value of a government or private sector employee's future pension checks are not included in their PNW calculations. Why should DBEs with relatively low annual earnings be penalized in these uncertain times for maximizing pension savings over the course of their careers?",,,,,,,

The DOT has done a better job than most of utilizing this certification.  However, once it is attained in a state and acknowledged by the DOT, help me understand why we have to re-certify for almost ANY other state with the SAME paperwork etc.

I believe one of the other improvements should be: if you certify in a state where the DBE certification is recognized by the DOT - please accept that certification for bidding/business purposes in any other state.  As a small business, we do not have the resources nor time to spend on a process that has already been done.

Thanks to the program, I do believe it helped a little last year when we bid on an AMTRAK (ARRA) project against 9 other companies and won!  The project was completed on time and we continue to do some small projects.

While there are several improvements that can be made to the various programs, there are improvements that can yield significant positive results for DBE's and can be efficiently implemented nationwide.

1)  Implement a 'National DBE Program'  State DBE programs are simply too fragmented to be efficient.  DBE's may perform work on a contract located in any state but, DBE's cannot get stimulus funded Technical Assistance help in any state.

2)  Establish a nationwide network of 'private' Technical Assistance Providers to provide outreach, training, eligibility, and application assistance to DBE's who need to learn how to access the benefits available to them under the various programs.

3)  Provide funding to via contract to pay for the services provided by T/A Providers so that DBE's do not have to pay for such services.  In so doing establish a one-time grant or subsidy budget amount of $15,000 - $20,000 for each certified DBE in the program.

A lack of participation by the targetted group in federal-aid contracts is not de facto proof of discrimination.

I do consulting work for several local agencies in California that have implemented steps to make federal-aid contract dollars more accessible to DBE contractors. We have added outreach efforts and documentation requirements that have added to the overhead of federally-funded transportation projects, resulting in less service to the tax-paying public. The lack of participation that these local agencies have experienced is not due to any steps that the local agencies have not taken. To place the burden on the local agency for the lack of participation by a third party is, in my view, unreasonable.

If the federal government is concerned about the lack of participation by DBE contractors, it would be better for the Department to analyze the market conditions that lead to low participation rates, rather than penalize the local agencies for actions, or lack of actions, by a third party.",,,,,,,

In order to survive as a small business having a net worth of $750,000 today is not nearly sufficient if working in the public works arena.  In 2005 when my brother and i started a business I barely qualified as a DBE.  We started the business with 200k in savings, and 400,000 in equity lines of credit.  Banks would not lend us more than 40,000 in credit cards because we were new business.
In 2006 we used all 600,000 cash available and were in debt 40,000 on the credit cards.  We barely managed to make it through.  Since then the equity line of credits have been the back bone to our cash flow.  Working in the public sector arena takes an average of 90 to 120 days to get paid if working under a prime contractor.  With a personal net worth of $750,000 one does not have much room to borrow from banks. Increasing the limit to 1.3M would definitely help small business to grow and help employ more.

2.  The challenges with the rules of using DBE subcontractors is that most prime contractors perform a due diligence of 'Paper Trail'.  They does not exist a genuine interest in allowing a subcontractor to do the work that the prime can do with own employees.  Most contractors submit a paper trail of faxes and email asking for a subcontractor to bid on a project and they don't even know what the subcontractor services are.  When they do get a bid you never hear back.  I've personally called the project manager and sent emails responding to a soliciation for DBE subcontractor but never recieved a call back.  
In order to enforce DBE 'good faith efforts"" the needs to be a mandartory requirement that all contracts out to bid require the prime contractor to provide the email or fax of the contracting agency adminstrator to where a duplicate copy of subcontractor bid submitted to the prime contractor can be sent to the bidding agency in order for the bidding agency for comparison.",,,,,,,

I do not agree with the regulation that if SBA gives a company 8(a) certification that they automatically get DBE status.  We have many large, wealthy Native firms in Anchorage.  These firms create subsidiary companies - then get these companies 8(a) and DBE status.  Contracts are run through the companies as Primes or Subcontractors.

there has to be stricter rules on how a business owner can be considered disavantage, examples, there are businesses that gross 10-30 million a year and these business continue to be certified, these businesses are able to finance a greater amount of contract than a business that only does 1 mil in gross contract a year, these businesses are making it impossible for a true disavantage business to compete. You also have businesses being certified when they have a real small portion of minority in them. i am talking about for example, the owners great grandfather was hispanic so since he has a small percentage of minority he is now considered to be disavantaged. there is great abuse of this program and there should be more regulation on the certifing office,
the good faith goal does not work because people do not consider dbe firms only if it is mandatory, good faith means to a big general contractor a phone call is good enough i have personally bid on good faith projects and i have never been able to enter into contract. until you make a mandatory goal will more dbe firms be able to compete. i really hope you consider a true small disavantage business owner point of view. thank you",,,,,,,

I am in your target market.   I founded a small, woman-owned DBE software company 2.5 years ago.  I have a CCR, and am an official DOT CUCP DBE.   I am also highly qualified:  I hold a Ph.D. from Stanford and have 9 years of experience as a Director at Oracle in applications development of enterprise software.  I have been to conferences in Sacramento, the Bay Area, and in Los Angeles to learn about Federal contracting.  I have found government contracts to be very difficult to acquire.  Here is my analysis of why:

1.   Government contracting can create a deadlock for DBEs:  you need experience in order to gain a contract.   But to gain experience, you need a contract.  Contracting happens in a small and closed community.  Most of the women and minority DBEs who have contracts worked beforehand with the agencies they from whom received contracts.  

2.  Government contracting often requires very large organizations to fulfill the contracts.  Contracts are  rarely broken up into smaller projects, which are of the size and scope that DBEs can execute.  

3.   From my own perspective, raising the personal net work requirements for DBE owners is helpful, but does not impact me at all.  My impression is that this  change will assist the DBEs at the top of the food chain. 

Given my experience above, here are my recommendations to improve DBE representation:

1. The change you suggest to make sure prime contractors fulfill commitments to use DBEs is a good one, and it is fair to hold them to that rule that they cannot dismiss without good cause.

2. I like the proposal to reduce the burden on small business seeking DBE certification in more than one state.  There should be one certificate, and it should apply throughout.   The more paperwork you make us fill out, the less energy and time we have to apply for contracts and do contracting work.

1.	the contractors know they can receive the work without meeting the DBE goals; and
2.	Recipients are indifferent to meeting the DBE goals because there are no consequences for not meeting the goals.

James Transportation Group is registered to work statewide in California and is ready, willing and able to do so, yet for all the purported DBE outreach efforts in California, JTG is rarely contacted to provide services on federally funded contracts.

This was particularly clear during the spending of ARRA stimulus funds, when black-owned businesses received just 1.1 percent of $46 billion in federal stimulus contracts, and Latino-owned business received only 1.7 percent, according to the AP.

The proposed rule changes will help change this by expanding the ability of women and minority-owned businesses to compete fairly for federal contracts through the DBE program.

The next steps for the USDOT should be to expand the bonding assistance for DBEs it introduced last year, and to increase transparency and accountability by requiring quarterly, publicly accessible reports on subcontracts to DBEs and actual work hours performed by minorities and women.

With knowledge of the trades he was able to join the union, earn a living for his family, start a successful construction business and stabilize our neighborhood with his personal security. Now my African American students are struggling to enter construction trades.  I know this matters.

Sincerely,
Aneesa Parks",,,,,,,

Now that we have the data regarding Disadvantaged Business Enterprises and see the very low percentages of DBE recipients I urge you to adopt stronger language with accountability measures to allow DBEs to fairly compete for DOT projects.

My organization works with both rural and urban communities experiencing crushing poverty and lack of access to good paying jobs. It's time to encourage DBEs and support their success instead of continuing the system that hands projects to mega firms that often have political ties that help them win contracts.

When our communities are strong with access to good paying jobs everybody benefits.  Families want good jobs to offer their children the chance to participate in the American dream.  Our public funds should support those who need jobs the most and DBEs who are more likely to keep money in communities.",,,,,,,

Proposed rule changes expand the ability of women and minority-owned businesses to compete fairly for federal contracts through the DBE program.

I recommend that the USDOT expand the bonding assistance for DBEs it introduced last year, and increase transparency and accountability by requiring quarterly, publicly-accessible reports on subcontracts to DBEs and actual work hours performed by people of color and women.",,,,,,,

We are writing to support certain aspects of the proposed rulemaking that would amend 49 CFR Part 26 (Docket No. OST-2010-0118).

In particular, we strongly support the proposed adjustment to the personal net worth (PNW) test under consideration that would revise the PNW cap from $750,000 to $1.31 million (49 CFR 26.67).  We have found that the unadjusted PNW cap has driven some of our clients to make economic decisions that are not always in the best interests of the DBE firm, or in the best interests of the qualifying DBE owner.   

For example, historically the value of the DBE firm itself and the personal residence of the qualifying DBE owner have been excluded from the PNW calculation.   We are aware that in order to continue to meet the unrealistically low PNW cap some DBE firms have built up value within the DBE firm itself instead of distributing that wealth to the qualifying DBE owner because that wealth would be “charged against” his or her PNW cap.  Often this accumulation of value within a DBE firm leaves the firm vulnerable to other problems, such as accumulated earnings tax, being targeted for litigation, and so forth.

Similarly, we are aware of qualifying DBE owners who have acquired personal residences of more significant value that they might otherwise have acquired – simply because its value would not be “charged against” the PNW calculation.

In short, we see the low PNW cap as influencing DBE firms and their owners to make economic decisions based on typical market factors rather than being driven by an artificially low PNW cap.

We also endorse  the exclusion from the PNW calculation of the qualifying DBE owner’s qualified retirement accounts such 401k accounts, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), Roth IRAs, Keough plans, SEP plans and similar tax deferred accounts.

This was particularly clear during the spending of ARRA stimulus funds, when black-owned businesses received just 1.1 percent of $46 billion in federal stimulus contracts, and Latino-owned business received only 1.7 percent, according to the AP.

The proposed rule changes will help change this by expanding the ability of women and minority-owned businesses to compete fairly for federal contracts through the DBE program.

The next steps for the USDOT should be to expand the bonding assistance for DBEs it introduced last year, and to increase transparency and accountability by requiring quarterly, publicly accessible reports on subcontracts to DBEs and actual work hours performed by minorities and women.",,,,,,,

Docket Number OST-2010-0118

The provisions in this rule would be a tremendous help for those of us attempting to start/run small DBE businesses, especially in the south.  

My firm is 1 1/2 years old and we've had moderate sucess even in a recession.  I'm finding it relatively easy to get on teams as a subconsultant and we've been successful winning projects.  But then i have to start an additional ""campaign"" to push my prime consultants into actually signing a contract and assigning us the work.  By the time I've marketed the client for the job, then coerced my prime consultants into signing a contract with us and finally actualy giving us the work, i've spent most of my anticipated profit already.  

Also, filing the necessary paperwork to become a DBE consultant in each state takes a REMARKABLE amount of time and energy, primarily because of the financial reporting that has to be done.  If i had the time to do several states at one time, all the financials would be identical.  But i've tried to do them one at a time and my financials change so i have to run the reports and fill out the same forms again with different numbers.  It woudl be a huge advantage to be able to apply my DBE in MS to other state DOTs by proxy.  I have contacts in TN and GA and would love to start marketing those states but i cant do much because I'm not registered as a DBE there yet and dont have anything special to offer that's not already there.

My only final comment is How soon can you get this going!!",,,,,,,

This change to 49 CFR Part 26 would be welcome.

The current low PNW threshold often drives the disadvantaged owners of DBE firms to make economic decisions based on DBE status retention rather than other, more conventional, market drivers.  For example, the exclusion of the business firm itself from the PNW calculation results in some DBE owners causing value to accumulate within the business rather than distributing it to the owners.  This can result in accumulated earnings tax issues, increases in litigation exposure, and so forth.

I also support the exclusion of qualified retirement accounts from the calculation of the PNW cap.  Funds in qualified retirement accounts, while perhaps liquid, are not easily liquidated and available for the use of the DBE business without tax penalties.  For this reason exclusion from the calculation is warranted.

Finally, I also endorse an additional rule change that would cause the PNW cap to be revisited every year and adjusted based upon the CPI-U.  At a minimum this should be done every few years – not every twenty.

Thank you for considering these views.",,,,,,,

I have read many of the responses. Many feel as I do that good faith efforts are nonexistent. Generals bury us subs in a windfall of request for bids, while not intending to use any of our services. I’ve placed bids and receive calls from the contractors asking if we intend to bid. What happened to our bid? I receive requests for bid without our services as one of the needed trades. A windfall of paper to satisfy your request of good faith effort. I attend many outreach meetings to learn I am excluded because I am non-Union. How much UDBE small business is union? We need a project percentage in carve outs so small and disadvantaged businesses can compete. I have nothing against prevailing wages, but most generals are union on State and Federal jobs. This excludes non-union UDBE, SBE, LBE, etc. If your true intention is to help small minority businesses you must address the absence of carve outs on these projects. This will allow non-union disadvantaged businesses to bid these projects for the generals. I also feel that if they use our certification to attain a project they should be held accountable for non-use of the certified subcontractor. I have been called by Caltrans to confirm the amounts of our contract bid and never did hear from the general. 
I don’t think raising the net worth of the minority contractors will make the program more successful. It will only let more non disadvantage people into the program. I think that many  DBE’s  have experienced the same problems. Why then is it still happening? Why have the very apparent barriers not been removed or changed? I still have great hopes that the changes made to the DOT rules will help the small and disadvantaged businesses.",,,,,,,

Continue to allow each State to make their DBE certification decisions independently. Do not place the out of State firms over the Home State for certification. There are too many differences between States to resolve out of State certs. ie, renewed site visits, annual update, denial hearings and most of all TrUST,     

Continue to require Primes contractors to document changes in DBE subs, to lessen this task would invite abuse.",,,,,,,

CDW hereby provides comments/suggestions based upon our 2 decades of experience.  First, in order to address the possible issue of “shopping around” for the easiest certifying states (CFR, pg 25818, col. 3), CDW suggests that before a DBE firm can seek Interstate Certification, that DBE firm MUST first become certified in the state of its original incorporation  (“home” state).  That home state government certifying agency should have the local knowledge and resources to determine eligibility of its locally based firm. 

In addition, given the latest concern and trend on government contracting for “transparency”, especially under ARRA funded projects, CDW suggests that there be well publicized details, with well defined avenues, for anonymous complaints for inconsistencies, or outright fraud for that matter, on DBE certification and (sub)contracting, using similarly protective language for “whistleblowers” as currently publicized under ARRA.  The mere public announcement of its illegality and penalties, and well publicized avenues for reporting of such, can by itself deter  prime and subcontractors from those inconsistencies;  thereby minimizing the need for the DBE certifying state staff to visit all DBE contract job sites (CFR, page 25817, col. 1).  In other words, education and readily available vehicles for “whistleblowing” can go a long way towards compliance for the DBE program; or the fear of enforcement sometimes is enough to keep firms in compliance.  CDW also suggests that there be readily available information, perhaps on the first page of a website, as to what is not allowed to be counted toward “DBE contracting” credits.  In other words, only labor completed by DBE firm can be counted towards satisfying DBE goals; and labor subcontracted out by DBE firm CANNOT be counted (CFR, page 25821, c2).

Brown",,,false,DOT-OST-2010-0118-0001,,,,2010-07-08T04:00Z,,,,,,,,"Comment(s)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"R.D.","Brown",,,,,"TxDOT",,,,,,"TxDOT agrees with the increased oversight by state agencies to ensure that prime contractors fulfill their DBE commitments on contracts but it is only effective with increased enforcement mechanisms such as assessing damages for goal shortfalls when the prime has not made a Good Faith Effort (GFE) to meet the goal.  If there is an absence of a GFE, there is no benefit to the integrity of the DBE program.  The volume of contracting should be considered since compliance rule changes impact large states with huge contracting volumes more than smaller states.  Guidelines for recipient staffing should be added to any new compliance policies that create workload increases. 

DBE's should not be removed from the program without a full review unless the DBE has failed to cooperate and no onsite has been conducted.  The regulations need to more clearly outline the decertification process. 

TxDOT does not agree with automatically accepting other state's certifications because the DBE certification process in some states is not as stringent as others.  Some state do not conduct valid on-site eligibility reviews and others states mix Commercially Useful Function aspects into their DBE certification review.

Any changes in the required frequency of conducting on-sites reviews should consider the business structure and ownership of the firm.  Sole proprietorships and registered professional businesses that have no changes indicated in the Annual Update documents do not require on-site reviews as frequently as successful DBE  corporations owned by multiple owners.  Any added on-site workload should include a provision for minimum recipient staffing requirements to handle any additional workload. 

TxDOT believes that all retirement plans should be counted, especially if the PNW limit is going to be doubled.
A complex value issues involving retirement plans that are not readily available without withdrawal penalties need to be addressed.  The regulations need to specifically address how recipients should calculate the value of such plans.

The 30-day fast track DBE certification of out-of-state firms places unwarranted pressure on may states.  Some states are very unresponsive to requests for copies of on-site review reports and other information  related to DBE certification.  Because of the inconsistency of various DBE certification programs, especially in large states with multiple certification agencies, the required due diligence in reviewing out-of-state certification information to uphold the integrity of the DBE Program can be very time consuming.  If this proposal is added to the DBE Program, then when one state agency asks for information from another state agency then the requested agency should be required to provide the information within a seven day time frame.

The application process can be cumbersome due to the differences in the format of the DBE verus SBA 8(a) applications. The 8(a) application's questions require ""yes""and ""no""answers. The DBE application (USDOT approved) requires more detailed information than the 8(a) application. Certification applicant firms could submit the same documentation to the DBE Program that they submitted for 8(a) certification, but the detailed and notarized DBE application should be required for DBE Program certification. 

TxDOT believes that the revised DBE Program regulations need to clearly indicated that any Prime Contractor that happens to have acquired part ownership (less than 49 percent) in a DBE affiliate should not be allowed to use that DBE affiliate firm to obtain DBE goal credit on Federal projects with DBE goals.  Even if a Prime acquires its ownership after bidding on the Federal DBE-goal contract, DBE goal credit should not be allowed.

In particular, I strongly agree with the proposed improved oversight and ensuring that DBEs have actually performed the work in question on each contract.  However, as was pointed out in the comments by one of the State Departments of Transportation, contracts and DBE performance are not necessarily consistent with reporting periods.  An “in-progress” type of explanation might be an additional acceptable justification for a required DBE percentage that has not yet been reached on a contract.  I do think that there needs to be some penalty assessed against companies that commit to a DBE goal and then do not meet their DBE commitment during the actual performance of the contract.
I also agree with the adjustment to the personal net worth (PNW) criterion, and the proposal to remove retirement savings from this calculation as well.  The government should be encouraging citizens (including small and disadvantaged business owners) to contribute to their retirement, particularly with the existing concerns regarding the social security system.   I would suggest that if at the time of certification, if a DBE applicant is under the cap (proposed now at $1.3 million) and the firm becomes certified, that grounds for “graduating” from the DBE program should not be based on what the PNW of the DBE owner becomes, but should be based only on the amount of business that the firm does on an annual basis as currently defined.  Or as an alternative, the cap can be indexed to inflation or another measure, and if the PNW of the qualifying DBE owner exceeds that indexed adjusted amount, that would be a criteria for “graduation” from the program.
I applaud the clarification to clear up the misunderstanding regarding once a firm is certified as a DBE it stays certified unless and until it is decertified using the procedures of 26.87.
Thank you for the chance to comment.",,,,,,,

I sincerely appreciate the proposed changes to broaden DBE and small business program utilization. My 1-2 person firm got certified as a DBE on May 2009, and to date my firm has not been able to obtain any projects with either Federal or State funds regardless of the effort, breadth or competence of my firm.
Respectfully, I have the following comments for your consideration:
1.	The current definition of what constitutes a small business is counter-intuitive. In the United States a small business has less than 500 employees and $7 million in annual receipts (in Europe, less than 50 employees, and in Australia, 15 employees). 
2.	In the event that the small business definition is not revised or updated, how can my small firm compete against established firms 25-250 times larger than mine, even though the quality of the professional services provided are equivalent?
3.	Even with such a broad definition, current requirements for small business participation are minimal or non-existant in the State of California per my experience pursuing DOT or high speed rail projects (for instance, the CA High Speed Rail Authority small business participation as of last month was 2.29%).
4.	Per my experience, both large and small engineering companies would much rather hire foreign engineers imported with H1-B visas and exploited during the time these individuals secure green card or citizenship status, while at the same time disregarding the large number of underemployed engineers who are competent or could be retrained (for instance, building design background expanded to bridge design approach). This is a grave injustice to both foreign and domestic engineers for the bottom line of small and large businesses which undermines my profession and our society.

I do agree that small businesses are indispensable for the health and well-being of our local communities, and welcome any and all steps you undertake to benefit small business and our communities.

Sincerely,

Alistair",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2010-0118-0111/attachment_1.doc",

Accountability for Recipients With Respect to Overall Goals
•	This change if enacted will serve to convert the Overall Goal to an Overall Set-Aside.  As proposed, there is no opportunity for a Recipient to document Good Faith Effort (GFE) in any given year of the three-year Overall Goal.  The USDOT is using language in this section such as “must” and “required”.  Therefore, since the Recipient has to achieve the Overall Goal each year or take corrective actions to achieve the Overall Goal the following year, the Overall Goal will become an Overall Set-Aside.  This runs counter to the narrowly-tailored nature of the DBE Program.  I do not agree with this approach.

Goal Submission
•	The USDOT proposes to make the Recipient responsible for “good faith implementation” of the Overall Goal in each of the three years.  However, by requiring the Recipient to meet the Overall Goal or take corrective actions to meet the Overall Goal the next year, the Overall Goal has become an Overall Set-Aside and the Recipient is not able to show good faith implementation efforts.  See previous comment.

Improving Oversight
•	I agree with the USDOT’s attempt to strengthen the Recipient’s responsibility to perform CUF reviews;
•	I do not agree with the USDOT’s proposal to not strengthen the language regarding the DBELO having direct and independent access to the CEO.  DOTs interpret that requirement in their own way and leave to the Division Office to disprove their statement that the DBELO has direct and independent access to the CEO.  The explanation provided on page #25817 defining direct and independent access as “the DBELO must not be required to get anyone’s consent or sign-off, or ‘go through channels’, to talk and write personally to the CEO about DBE program matters” is much more specific and would be a helpful addition to the regulation; and
•	I do not agree with the USDOT’s proposal to not strengthen the language regarding the Recipient be adequately staffed to administer the DBE Program.  During good economic conditions, Recipients tend to add the DBELO responsibility as a collateral responsibility to an employee.  During economic stringency, there is an even greater push by the Recipient to reduce even further the resource allocation for the implementation of the DBE Program.  As the DBELO, the incumbent is responsible for the following: either performing DBE Certification and/or ensuring that it is being implemented effectively (including preparing Appeal responses for applicants that have appealed the decision to the USDOT), implementing or monitoring the effective implementation of a DBE Business Development Program, conducting shortfall analyses in the pre- and post-award situations (for Recipients that set Contract Goals), developing the Overall Goal (and for Recipients that have Public Transportation and Aviation under the Recipient, the DBELO will be responsible for three Overall Goal-setting efforts), data collection and analysis to develop the Uniform Reporting Forms, ensuring the Recipient/Municipality is conducting CUF reviews or conducting the CUF reviews personally, mediating prompt payment disputes between DBE firms and prime contractors, and informing the CEO of issues on a periodic basis.  This would be a daunting task for one person let alone a person that has the DBELO function as a collateral duty.  The language needs to be strengthened to indicate that at a minimum, the DBELO should be a dedicated position and not added to another position.  Additionally, adequate staffing needs to be further defined to allow for DBELOs that have FTA and FAA responsibilities as well (i.e., one DBELO for each modal agency).

Personal Net Worth
•	I do not agree with the USDOT’s proposal to utilize the CPI to adjust the PNW cap for inflation.  A 73% adjustment will work to markedly increase the number of applicants to the DBE Program.  It is true that the cap was set based upon 1989 numbers, but the practical application through the continued deduction of the applicant-owner’s primary residence and interest in the business serves to reinforce that the $750,000 cap is an effective cap to maintain.  If the USDOT is going to adjust the PNW cap no matter what, why not use the $1,000,000 cap offered under the previous FAA (49 CFR Part 23) DBE Program.  This will serve to increase the PNW cap and almost split the difference; and
•	PNW & Retirement Savings: Applicants presently use shelters creatively to allocate assets.  To simplify Recipients’ applications evaluations, all Retirement Savings plans should be counted as assets.  This will eliminate the need to exempt certain plans and will work to address applicants inappropriately sheltering assets to exclude them from PNW consideration.

Interstate Certification and Related Issues
•	The proposed Rebuttable Presumption Reciprocity System will have the practical impact of flooding the DBE Programs with applications and will serve to dilute the work that is available to presently certified DBE firms.  As long as a firm is certified in one State, this will enable the DBE firm to now apply to 49 remaining States and DC and Puerto Rico.  If a State presently has 350 firms certified (for example) and only 100 firms perform the work contracted to DBEs, this situation will deteriorate exponentially under this construct.  If prime contractors generally contract with the same DBEs presently, they will not be looking to gamble on unknown out-of-State firms that have been certified under this proposal (especially in a poor economy).  Additionally, the opportunity for fraud will exponentially increase because the Recipient will find it much simpler to either certify the applicants or not to respond at all (which under this proposal means that the applicant is certified).  Also, the State UCPs will not free up resources presently allocated to DBE Certification, but will most likely need to increase personnel resources to accommodate the increased administrative burden.  The reality of the situation is this: There are varied approaches to Certification and how the regulations are applied depends upon the education and experience of a given Certification Specialist.  Compound this with the fact that numerous Recipients have housed the DBE Certification process in their State Small Business Set-Aside Offices.  This means that employees steeped in the State Set-Aside Program processes are responsible for DBE Program certification.  If one were to add all these considerations together, the opportunities for the certification of fraudulent firms will greatly increase.  I do not agree with the USDOT’s proposal and propose that the best approach is an aggressive educational/instructional effort through the USDOT modal agencies to educate the State UCP Certification Specialists.

Fostering Small Business Participation
•	The Small Business Element proposal does not even reference the DBE Business Development Program construct as defined in Appendix C to 49 CFR Part 26.  This proposal should be linked to the DBE Business Development Program in some way.  Regarding the number of strategies, as long as the present list is neither exhaustive nor mandatory, it is a good start to offer possible approaches.  As for the amount of time necessary for Recipients to amend their DBE Program documents, the amount of time should reflect the efforts needed by Recipients that have not developed any of the strategies listed or others not listed.  Therefore, allowing Recipients one year to implement a Small Business Element should be sufficient time;
•	The DBE Workshop Approach (using the Missouri and Wisconsin models as examples) has merit.  However, FHWA is presently performing five DBE Workshops this calendar year and my understanding is that a White Paper will be developed based upon input from the Recipients that are hosting the DBE Workshops.  It may be more beneficial to wait until after the DBE Workshops have been held and to incorporate the Best Practices generated through the DBE Workshops into an overall suggested approach that will be left up to the Recipients as to how to incorporate any/all of the DBE Workshop elements into their routine federal-aid Construction Project processes;
•	Regarding discriminatory or excessive Bonding Practices, prime contractors should treat non-DBE as well as DBE Subcontractors the same when it comes to Bonding Practices.

Terminations and Substitutions of DBE Subcontractors
•	The Listing of Good Causes for a prime contractor to request formal termination of a DBE Subcontractor is adequate.  However, it appears that either the List is missing number (ii) or the items are inaccurately numbered following number (i).  Additionally, number (iv) may need further definition as it is open-ended.  This item should be tied to items identified in the Subcontract agreement.

Counting Issue
•	I agree that items supplied by the prime contractor should not be counted towards the Contract Goal.  However, there is a more important issue that needs to be addressed.  Under 49 CFR 26.55, this regulation clearly defines a DBE firm’s role as a subcontractor to not only install materials, but to also furnish the materials to be installed.  In 2006, an FHWA Memorandum directed Recipients that joint-check situations are acceptable only after the Recipient has previously formally approved the joint-check situation.  In the absence of a joint-check situation, if a DBE firm does not furnish and install the materials, the only commercially-useful-function that the DBE firm is performing is that of a Broker of labor services.  The eligibility in the case of a Broker is the percentage equivalent to the administrative fees.  There is definitely a disagreement regarding this situation amongst the States (federal and State) and it would be greatly beneficial to have clarification from the USDOT.

Application and PNW Forms
•	If the USDOT in whole or in part adopts the Interstate Certification process, there will need to be clarification as to what forms are acceptable.

Certification-Related Provisions
•	I agree with the USDOT’s proposal to expand upon the DBE applicant’s responsibility to supply detailed information for the UCP to assign an appropriate NAICS Code and with the charge to present up-to-date information;
•	While I agree with most of the USDOT statements made in this section, I do not agree that an applicant should be allowed to not have an inventory and warehouse if it is applying as a Supplier or that an applicant should not be required to have equipment either owned by the applicant or long-term leased from a firm other than the prime contractor as a measure of DBE eligibility.  If a firm is applying as a Broker, then a telephone, computer, and Office space rented (or at home) may be sufficient.  In the case of applicants for Suppliers and Contractors, there does need to be a minimum amount of expectations that an applicant is expected to realize.  This section needs to be revised accordingly.  Additionally, this is the first time that I have heard from the USDOT that the DBE Program serves as “an incubator for start-up businesses”.  The only mention presently of business development in 49 CFR Part 26 is in Appendix C.  If the USDOT is transitioning the DBE Program to a USSBA-type business program, there will need to be a great deal more focus by Recipients on implementing Appendix C and a much greater level of funding will need to be provided either by Recipients or FHWA (and especially FTA and FAA) to make this a reality;
•	The proposed acceptable lifespan of an On-Site Report (three to five years) is of concern.  During the review/approval process for UCPs approximately seven years ago, I was informed by the USDOT that the lifespan of an On-Site Report was approximately seven to nine years.  Now, I understand that the USDOT has revised the lifespan downward by four years.  While I agree that On-Site Reports need to be updated periodically, this downward adjustment has effectively halved the lifespan and will have a significant resource impact (especially if the Interstate Certification construct is in any way implemented) on Recipients.  I agree that On-Site Reports need to be updated, but that the interval should be every five to seven years and not every three to five years.  Regarding use of Videoconferencing or other technologies, these media do not replace the actual On-Site visual inspection necessary to confirm that an applicant has an Office/Business Site, inventory, sufficient equipment, etc.  The actual interview may be conducted via other media, but the visual On-Site inspection cannot be replaced and will need to be performed by the Home State Recipient.  Regarding charging user fees to applicants, I support this proposal if the Interstate Certification proposal is implemented in any form.  Finally, there is no way that additional documentation will replace the visual On-Site inspection.

The South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) offers the following comment concerning the United States Department of Transportation’s proposed rule change concerning the requirement of State B to certify an out-of-state firm within 30 days after receipt of information from State A.  SCDOT currently handles approximately 40-50 new applications that are pending within a given timeframe. Applications are processed based on date of receipt and within established timeframe in accordance with current DBE rule. Requiring SCDOT to place out-of-state firms ahead of all in-state applications could hinder contracting opportunities in the firm’s home state. This requirement would also create more challenges for SCDOT from both the general public and elected official perspectives. SCDOT would like to propose that State B be allowed 60 business days from receipt of all information to certify firms, with State A providing State B with a copy of the out-of-state’s existing application package along with the on-site review report within 5 business days. This approach will alleviate unwarranted pressure on State B by allowing adequate time for review of all documents, given budget constraints and limited staffing resources. 

SCDOT offers the following comment regarding the burden of proof in a decertification proceeding. The firm seeking the certification should continue to carry the burden of proof with respect to eligibility requirements. Approximately thirty (30) percent of the denied applications processed by SCDOT are out-of-state firms who are certified in their home state. Keeping the current DBE rule intact would reduce the administrative burden on State B.",,,,,,,

I assume that the rationale behind the DBE program is to educate and provide support and opportunities for small businesses to flourish and grow to the point where they can no longer be called a DBE and then make room for smaller businesses to do the same thing.  In my opinion, $1.3 million personal net worth is not disadvantaged.  I would hope that a company that is able to grow the owner's net worth to that would be willing to stand on its own and allow smaller companies to obtain business through the DBE program.  That is why I am in favor of the Dept. of Colorado Transportation Department comment that reads:   ""That Personal Net Worth – The proposed rule increasing the PNW cap to $1.3 million explains that this change “does not represent an increase in actual personal worth” because the “inflationary adjustment simply maintains the economic status quo.” In Colorado and other western states with similar economies and “cost of living” levels, an individual with a $1.3 million personal net worth may not necessarily be considered economically disadvantaged. Unfortunately a “one-size-fits-all” solution will help DBEs in some regions and hurt DBEs in states like Colorado. Because of the economic downturn, Colorado’s DBEs have been hurt severely and are having more difficulty obtaining financing, insurance and bonding. Large construction companies (including larger and stronger DBEs) are bidding on all projects, large and small. Because of their size, these larger firms have the ability to under-bid our smaller DBE firms. This PNW increase will allow financially strong DBEs to remain in the program, thus preventing newer and smaller DBEs from growth.
The proposed rule should not be an across the board change.""",,,,,,,

As a member of the Transportation Equity Network, I support some changes in the  rules in order to give disadvantaged business enterprises a fair chance; they have  often struggled for fair access to federal contracts under the current DBE program.

This was particularly clear during the spending of ARRA stimulus funds, when black-owned businesses received just 1.1 percent of $46 billion in federal stimulus contracts, and Latino-owned business received only 1.7 percent, according to the AP.

The proposed rule changes will help change this by expanding the ability of women and minority-owned businesses to compete fairly for federal contracts through the DBE program.

RE:	Office of Secretary, DOT
	Docket No. OST-2010-0118

Dear Sir or Madam,

The Executive Committee of Colorado’s Uniform Certification Program (COUCP) hereby offers the following comments to the notice of proposed rulemaking that will affect the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program.

Accountability for Recipients With Respect to Overall Goals – The proposed rule will require a State DOT that fails to meet its overall goal to submit a detailed plan to correct problems it has identified.  We suggest that each respective FHWA State Division Office be given the authority to approve or disapprove this submission by the state.  Because it will be important for States to receive approval of their plans as quickly as possible in order to implement any changes, etc., this approval process should be at the local level in order to allow for quick implementation and correction.  

Clarification of 3 year Annual Goal Submission – The proposed rule suggests allowing recipients the ability to provide a year-to-year projection of its likely DBE participation within the framework of a goal and methodology submitted only every three years.  The proposed rule suggests that this flexibility is more relevant for FAA programs because of the likelihood of federal funding fluctuations.  We suggest that the Department allow Recipients to choose one or the other process for benchmarking.  Choosing either a three-year overall goal number with appropriate accountability processes as described in Section 26.47(c) or a year-to-year projection as described here would give the industry a clear understanding of how the State DOT, Transit Agency, or Airport Authority will be setting their goals.  Changing mid-stream in the process could make reporting very difficult and defeat the purpose of lessening the burden of setting annual goals each year.

 
Personal Net Worth – The proposed rule increasing the PNW cap to $1.3 million explains that this change “does not represent an increase in actual personal worth” because the “inflationary adjustment simply maintains the economic status quo.”  In Colorado and other western states with similar economies and “cost of living” levels, an individual with a $1.3 million personal net worth may not necessarily be considered economically disadvantaged.  Unfortunately a “one-size-fits-all” solution will help DBEs in some regions and hurt DBEs in states like Colorado.  Because of the economic downturn, Colorado’s DBEs have been hurt severely and are have more difficulty obtaining financing, insurance and bonding.  Large construction companies (including larger and stronger DBEs) are bidding on all projects, large and small.  Because of their size, these larger firms have the ability to under-bid our smaller DBE firms.  This PNW increase will allow financially strong DBEs to remain in the program, thus preventing newer and smaller DBEs from growth.

The proposed rule should not be an across the board change.  The increased PNW to $1.3 million may be very appropriate for concessions (ACDBEs) since those businesses are capital intensive and have higher cash flow requirements.  Many ACDBEs have to build out their concession space and require bank financing.  In today’s lending environment, a lender will require higher asset levels and in fact some are franchises and franchisors often require higher net worths to operate a franchise.  We strongly encourage USDOT to adopt the higher PNW threshold in Part 23 only, not in Part 26.  We do not believe a one-size-fits-all standard that suits Part 23 should be applied to Part 26.

Some changes that could offset this trend may include proposing a time limit for participation in the DBE program.  An additional change would be to allow states the flexibility to set “tiered” DBE project goals that would allow smaller DBEs to bid against similarly situated companies.  Without implementing changes to other parts of the regulation, this PNW increase will penalize small and new DBE firms.

The proposal to remove retirement savings from the PNW calculation will, in our opinion, also benefit the wealthier DBEs and decrease the number of graduations because of personal net worth.  Based on Colorado’s experience, family owned businesses (especially those that are woman owned) are more likely to have these types of retirement accounts and use them already to limit their tax liability.  If there is a demographic study done, we believe that the majority of individuals that would benefit from this would be non-minority individuals.  One of the arguments in favor of removing retirement savings from the PNW calculation is that they cannot be drawn on.  We disagree with this assertion.  Many can be drawn upon, though at a penalty, but they can be drawn upon.  In addition, they can be borrowed against.  We believe that the consequence of adopting both a higher threshold and removing more assets from consideration means that almost anyone will be considered economically disadvantaged.  In Adarand the Supreme Court found Program eligibility, as it was at the time, to be both over-inclusive and under-inclusive.  We believe that the proposed adjustments move eligibility back in the direction of being over-inclusive.  By doing so, we believe the door will open wider to further Constitutional challenges on the basis that the Program is not narrowly tailored.

 
To monitor potential abuse of this proposal, we recommend a requirement that DBEs provide an annual statement identifying changes in their contributions to the accounts during the past year.  A review by certification staff could identify whether individuals and companies were sheltering their assets for the purpose of remaining within the PNW cap.

Interstate Certification and Related Issues –

NPRM outlines 3 possible approaches:

•	Leave things as they are now, firms must apply in each state, states are allowed the freedom to reach their own conclusions regarding eligibility, may enter into their own regional reciprocity agreements;

•	Federalize certification, central directory;

•	Interstate reciprocity
•	“Presumptively certified”
•	State B must certify within 30 days unless it had good cause to object
•	Local appeal must be provided

Of the 3 approaches, it is the opinion of COUCP that the NPRM favors the one with the least appeal.  COUCP is sympathetic to desire to reduce the burden of firms seeking certification in multiple states.  However, that is only one of several concerns, and certainly not the most important.  COUCP strongly believes that the paramount concern should always remain the integrity of the Program.  We further believe that of the 3 approaches identified, the NPRM favors the one which weakens the Program the most.  Of the 3 approaches, COUCP strongly favors leaving the process for certifying out-of-state firms with the individual states.  If the resource problem could be resolved, COUCP would be in favor of Federalizing, or centralizing, the process.  We do not favor interstate reciprocity as proposed.  Our reasoning follows.

Process

The NPRM acknowledges that there currently exists across the country widely divergent processes, interpretations, experience, and expertise.  The most glaring example of the lack of uniformity of processes can be found in the manner in which on-site interviews are conducted.  Many on-site transcripts we have obtained from home states have little to no practical value in determining a firm’s eligibility.  The Regulation currently requires that all recipients use the same application form, and that before a certification decision is rendered an on-site visit be conducted or a transcript obtained from the home state.  COUCP believes that the next logical step, before mandating interstate reciprocity, is to move toward standardizing the process by first mandating the use of a uniform on-site questionnaire.  Some will counter by saying that circumstances are always different and they don’t want to be bound to a document that may not take into account those differences.  To that, we respond that a uniform questionnaire can always be supplemented to fit the circumstances.  Once that has been accomplished, the remainder of the process should be standardized.

 
Burden of Proof

The NPRM proposes shifting the burden of proof when processing applications of out-of-state firms from the applicant to the recipient.  At the same time, recipients would be required to render decisions within 30 days, and would be required to provide the applicant with a local hearing when it proposes to deny certification.  We believe that these proposals have numerous unintended consequences.

•	Burden of proof – We believe that the shifting of the burden of proof effectively holds in-state applicants to a higher standard that is inherently unfair to them.  Currently, applicant firms must be operational.  One aspect of “operational” is that they have met the legal requirements to do business, such as registering with the Secretary of State if a corporation, etc., or obtaining the proper license if engaged in an industry (e.g., engineering) requiring one.  If we must go through what amounts to a revocation process for out-of-state firms that have not met the legal requirements to do business, we argue that we would be in effect holding in-state applicants to a higher standard.  We strongly disagree with having disparate burdens of proof depending on whether an applicant is in the state or out.

•	30 days to render decision – The effect of this requirement is that out-of-state applications will be expedited at the expense of in-state applications.  This is inherently unfair to in-state applicants.

•	Local appeal of denial decisions – Places an increased burden on states to disprove a certification granted by another state that may have been flawed in the first place.  Also, this requirement appears at odds with USDOT’s stated desire that denials of all new applications be appealed directly to USDOT, not appealed locally.

Other considerations

•	The NPRM references a requirement to enter data into and research a national database prior to rendering certification decisions.  We believe this requirement amounts to an unfunded mandate, that it could require a full-time person to implement, and that these are resources we simply do not have at the present time.

•	If an out-of-state firm is presumptively certified, should it not follow that firms who lose their home-state certification be immediately decertified in other states?  If so, the administrative burden to continually check the home-state status of out-of-state firms is immense.

The NPRM acknowledges the difficulties with this proposal.  We agree with the Department’s observation that moving to nationwide reciprocity at this time is premature.

Cerpa",,,,"Local","The Hispanic American Construction Industry Association (HACIA) is a 31yr. old advocacy organization whose mission is to create equal access for minority firms and to prevent discriminatory practices in the construction industry.  Today HACIA’s membership represents over 300 highly qualified construction companies.  Since 1979, HACIA has opened doors for bid opportunities to thousands of minority-owned businesses and is recognized as one of the largest organizations in the Chicago area for construction contractors, professional services and related suppliers.  Throughout our history, HACIA has served as advocate not only of Hispanic-owned businesses in the industry but has grown as a valuable resource to firms seeking to include DBE/MBE and WBE businesses in their respective bidding or proposal needs.  

To that end, HACIA respectfully offers the following comments to the notice of proposed rulemaking that will affect the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program and all of its participants.  The commitment of all administrators and recipients to carry forth the program’s intent must not be lost with its spirit and objective in helping to expand capacity and success for all DBE’s who participate within its structure.

Accountability for Recipients with Respect to Overall Goals 26.47

HACIA supports the proposed change in holding recipients accountable for its goal setting processes.  As the existing regulation reads …accountability is the key to ensuring effective program implementation.  …Recipients should make strong efforts to understand the reasons why it has not met its overall goal and to figure out what it can do to correct the situation. It is imperative that we take all measures to ensure that established DBE programs serve more than mere lip service.  In many instances recipients establish high annual goals to squelch the pressures of politics, minority business and community advocates without regard as to how they plan to ensure achievement.  In some cases, recipients have maintained the same high goal while decreasing annual achievements consistently.  It would be logical to hold the same accountability to each recipient for its annual goal as is done to each prime contractor in its commitment to a contractual DBE participation.

Creative administration of DBE programs is necessary to assure successful goal achievements.  The “unbundling” proposed rule making will help in this regard along with further support of Mentor/Protégé projects, elimination of the “duel bonding” DBEs have to suffer when the bonding has been achieved by the prime contractor.  In addition USDOT can contribute to supporting recipients by exerting a stronger working relationship into the DBE program with Minority Financial Institutions (MFIs) throughout the country in exploring creative financing programs for DBEs in return for investments being made for their current independent uses.

Goal Submission

HACIA believes holding recipients to the year-to-year projection over the three year goal and methodology submission better serves the intent of the Accountability change.  Annual review of the recipient’s benchmarks being achieved (or not) will allow the opportunity to regroup and alter approaches that do not appear to be working sooner.  This will ultimately provide for a more effective DBE program striving towards success as opposed to failure.

Improving Oversight  

In the review of the suggest proposed rulemaking, it is more apparent the USDOT in reality needs to take stronger steps that recipients are in fact abiding by the letter of the law that exists in current regulations.  We seriously doubt that a mere requirement asking for written verification that a recipient has either monitored work sites or reviewed contracting records will account for actual performance or add to strengthening enforcement mechanisms.  Much too often, fronts across this country have been uncovered only after a deep review of records, interviews with employees and a check and balance in following the money trails.  Instead HACIA would suggest a requirement of monitoring contracts at a minimum within specific intervals or time periods (e.g., 60, 90,120 days etc.) during contract award.  Some states have adopted this process already and is a successful tool in maintaining the integrity of the program.



We are curious as to the consideration of the DBELO reporting channel with independent access to the CEO not requiring additional regulatory language.  I have administered DBE programs throughout my career and have witnessed this reporting inconsistency in several DBE programs managed by many of my colleagues for years.  Yet USDOT has not issued sanctions against said recipients for failing to comply with existing regulatory requirements.  Perhaps stronger directives as to what impacts USDOT will apply to funding or authorization of grants will clarify and bring home assurances of such reporting adherences.

For too long, the issue of adequate staffing has remained a habitual problem with many recipients.  Unfortunately, DBE programs within agencies are at times viewed as a mandate as opposed to a philosophy in practice.  If the leadership fails to instill the message of assuring success within a program from “the top down” to lower level managers, then all too often mediocrity is created.  The best way in achieving mediocrity is in the failing to address adequate staffing.  Currently, recipients across this country are being faced with incredible funding hardships like all of the economy and have instituted dramatic cutbacks or furlough days to balance their budgets.  USDOT should instead provide some degree of assistance in defining what may constitute adequate staffing.  Use of a recipients total committed dollars of DBE goals being established in determining a level of staffing may be one mechanism in helping to define this requirement.  Another suggested level in achieving adequate staffing is allowing recipients to outsource portions of program requirements such as monitoring (contract compliance) whereby workforce goals as required by OFCCP can also be accurately accounted for.

Personal Net Worth

HACIA agrees with the proposed change in increasing the PNW to $1.31 million.  In addition, we agree to discounting the assets of retirement savings.  Assets such as 401Ks, Roth IRAs etc. are not liquid in nature and are penalized if withdrawn prematurely.  Taxation on these investment vehicles are also delayed until withdrawn therefore, the DBE program’s current approach should work parallel to the IRS’s standard.  Savings accounts or CDs are a different story for consideration.  Yet the fact remains, credit reviews for contractors as well as bonding are so often tied to personal guarantees, therefore we support in the raised limit which has for too long been overlooked and has resulted in a number of successful DBEs graduating from the program.  Its thresehold has created a “too big to be small” syndrome that has stifled capacity growth within the program.  HACIA also suggests the best way to fail apply the inflationary adjustment at this point is in utilizing the CPI.

As a note of caution however, historically, DBEs in various regions of the country are impacted differently when considering PNW’s and costs associated with operations.  While instituting varying PNW caps by regions may be considered, such applications can subject DBE abuse by such firms residing on regional borders by a simple move of headquarters.  Every precaution must be taken in evaluating the pro’s and cons of regional PNW limits.

Additionally, given USDOT has elected to adopt pending FAA reauthorization claiming …it would not make sense to have one PNW number for FAA programs and another for FTA/FHWA programs, why not take a look at the overall gross receipt limitations as well.  Prior to 2004, USDOT DBE programs had established a Memorandum of Understanding between SBA requiring recipients to accept certified SBA 8(a) and 8(d) firms as bona fide DBEs.  Since this appears to have worked effectively in contributing support of the UCP process, it is puzzling as to why the size limits as established by SBA (NAICS) are not adopted as well.  Ironically, what is considered by the key agency that established the standard as to what specifically is a small business, remains argued by USDOT through its existing threshold of $22.4 million maximum limit.  HACIA strongly suggests to mirror the SBA size standards as well to help in eliminating confusion to the term small business and to help in contributing towards fostering a larger data base of ready, willing and able firms with added capacity to participate in recipients’ programs.

Interstate Certification Related Issues

HACIA sympathizes with DBEs across the country who have carried the burden in applying to a number of states for expanded opportunities.  However the intent that the proposed rule attempting to achieve at this point may be premature in its consideration.  The work taken by each recipient in developing the requirement of a state UCP was a most arduous task, taking years in development for some.  The common denominator discovered by all was the processes, interpretation and general application of the governing regulations differing by each recipient.  Some were stronger, some were weaker.  We believe much of the weakness of some recipients lies in the need to establish viable training programs by USDOT to all agencies in administering and understanding the processing of certification applicants.  While we applaud the efforts taken originally in developing a standard application, USDOT failed to address the associated component of an on-site review form to be adopted by all.  This is clearly seen by out-of-state recipients providing so many varying versions of an on-site review.  We believe implementing an Interstate Certification requirement will not change that problem, leaving each recipient to chase and further investigate the authenticity of out of state applicants.

The best of the suggested approach would be to allow copies of a firms original application to be submitted (along with updated support documentation) and leave the decision to the state in receipt of the same.  However, establishing a 30 response in decision of an out of state applicant appears inconsistent with the governing regulations currently of 90 days.  What may occur in the end is placing out of state applicants in favor over in state applicants within the process.

Withdrawal of applications by firms while initially suspect as to allowing for changes to confirm to eligibility, at times it lends itself to the overwhelming process new firms encounter when applying for the first time.  Understandably, the integrity of the program must be upheld and therefore, a requirement could suggest that “withdrawals” be prevented from resubmitting for a period of 90 days to prevent any questionable abuse or capitalizing on an anticipated or advertised project.

HACIA also supports UCPs providing online databases of certification denials or decertification’s.  Such information serves to help in the administration of uncovering fraudulent firms attempting to permeate the program.

Fostering Small Business Participation

This proposed mechanism is key to the “unbundling” goal.  The term “set-aside” have become unspeakable words since challenges have been implemented against the program.  Ahowever, it is more apparent that DBEs have participated in the program for decades as subcontractors as the participation data would dictate.  Unless measures are taken to bring DBEs into the prime contracting world and truly expand their individual capacity, USDOT must provide a vehicle of fair competitiveness for this transition.  The optional approach for recipients to establish a Small Business Initiative is a first start in helping to address this dilemma DBEs now face.  Such an initiative could establish a gross receipt limit (e.g. $10 million) for participants regardless of race, with open competition of contract values from $1 to $2 million thereby creating larger universe of competitiveness amongst like in kind companies.  This would result in awards ultimately to only small businesses many of which would be DBEs and helping in recipients increasing overall goal achievements. 

Bonding requests of varying degrees by primes to DBEs have been in place for years.  They range from bid to performance (HACIA has not been made aware of members being required to bond in above project value amounts).  What would better serve DBEs at this point is implementing no requirement for DBE s to provide bonds when prime contractors provide these same items for contract award consideration.  Another added portion to good faith effort stipulations would be that a DBEs failure to provide a bond would not serve as grounds for failing to consider subcontractor participation.

Counting Issue

HACIA recommends adhering to the prevention of prime contractors  from counting  as DBE participation good or equipment items they themselves contribute to a DBE for a project remains as the best approach at this time.  While the section addresses the impacts of construction firms with DBE goals, to change the counting provisions at this time will also greatly impact the opportunities of other wholesale suppliers who benefit from participating in the DBE program with prime contractors. 

Certification-Related Provisions

HACIA suggests the department secure clear guidance that can be relayed to DBE firms in helping to codify appropriate NAICS codes.  The table addressing each area of business is voluminous and will be lost amongst small firms attempting to verify their specific areas of specialty that will be used in counting participation.

Furthermore, it is startling to hear that recipients are arbitrarily making judgment calls on a firms capabilities or “DBE credit” possibilities being counted sometime in the future.  The DBE regulations have always stated and we support USDOT’s affirmation that counting issues are to be held separate and apart from certification which addresses ownership and control for eligibility.   

As to regular updated on-site reviews, the Illinois UCP practice has implemented updated on-site reports every five years.  This practice appears too worked within the UCP however, regardless of the time frame being five years or as suggested, every three years, conducting updated on-site reviews should be required now as the proposed rule has emphasized that a firm’s certification does not have a time period of lapsing.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment on the proposed revisions to the DBE regulations.

The majority of retirement programs have an annual dollar limit set by the government that can be invested, such as the 401K program, therefore the question of abuse is not an issue.  In addition, how an individual chooses to invest , whether aggressively or moderatedly creates the highs and lows in their funds, more of a reason why they should not be included in the PNW calculation.  At the very least if retirement funds remain in the calculation of the PNW, the value should be discounted by 75% with the constant market fluctuations and economic turmoil.

After reviewing the Notice of proposed rulemaking (“NPRM”), the Ohio Department of Transportation (“ODOT”) would like to offer the following comments:

Burden of Proof for Application Denials
On page 25819 of the NPRM, there is discussion regarding creation of a proposed rebuttable presumption reciprocity system where a firm that is either home-state certified in another state or is 8(a) certified with the SBA and seeks certification with another state UCP.   USDOT (""the Department"") is proposing to create a rebuttable presumption that the firm should be certified based on either another home state certification or SBA 8(a) certification.  USDOT has asked for comment regarding whether the prospective firm or the certifying agency should bear the burden of proof in the newly proposed proceeding.

In order to remain consistent with the current standard that an applicant bears the burden of proof during an appeal of denied application, ODOT believes that the applicant should continue to bear this burden, regardless of its status of holding another state certification or a SBA 8(a) certification.  

Schedule for On-Site Reviews  
The Department is seeking comments on how often on-site reviews should be conducted.  The NPRM suggests every three to five years initially, but later seems to indicate five years is too long to go between on-sites.  The Ohio UCP currently aims to conduct on-site reviews every three years and believe this is an effective schedule for reviews.  Accordingly, we would like to see the regulations require reviews no more frequently than every three years.  We agree that on-sites at five year intervals would be too infrequent.

Fostering Small Business Participation
The proposed rules include a requirement that recipients create a small business element in their DBE programs.  In early 2010, ODOT attempted to add a small business element to a large ARRA funded project.  This proved to be a very difficult task to do as the regulations are currently written.  Ultimately, ODOT removed this small business initiative.  However, we support the concept of fostering small business participation, if adequate resources are made available to the state DOTs for such a program.

Counting
49 CFR 26.55 (a)(1) states that supplies and equipment purchased by a subcontractor from a prime contractor will not be counted towards DBE participation.  In 2007, ODOT requested a waiver from the requirement in 49 CFR 26.55(a)(1).  This request was prompted by the unique market conditions in Ohio where ownership of asphalt companies has been condensed to a few select companies.  Additionally, the ODOT Construction and Material Specifications prohibit the hauling of hot mix from a distance greater than 50 miles.  These two things combined have created a situation that makes it difficult for DBE firms to succeed in the competitive bid environment.  However, ODOT’s request for waiver from the rule was denied.  

In 2009, ODOT submitted comments again supporting a change of the rule to allow items obtained by DBEs for a contract to be counted for DBE credit regardless of their non-DBE source (i.e. regardless of whether it was purchased from the prime).  Although it seems clear that the Department is not planning to change this portion of the regulations, believing that the basic policy objective of the current regulation is a sound one, ODOT would like to offer one additional comment.  

ODOT understands that the concern in this area is that the DBE program is structured to ensure that the DBE subcontractor is performing a commercially useful function.  ODOT does not want to see a ""pass through"" system created.  However, ODOT suggests that there could be a solution responsive to the needs of Ohio contractors as well as the concerns of the Department.   In the area of materials and supplies, 49 CFR 26.55 (a)(1) could be amended to permit supplies and/or materials purchased by a DBE subcontractor from a prime contractor to be counted towards DBE participation so long as the DBE subcontractor is responsible for installing any materials purchased from the prime contractor on that project.  ODOT believes this would ensure that the DBE firm is in fact performing a commercially useful function.  

Again, thank you for the opportunity to comment.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2010-0118-0166/attachment_1.doc",

RE:  Office of the Secretary, DOT - Docket number (OST-2010-0118)

John Wayne Airport hereby submits the following comments in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued by the Office of the Secretary, DOT, Docket number (OST-2010-0118).

1)	Section 26.39 – Fostering Small Business Participation – John Wayne Airport has implemented a small business participation program in its concession program and would not object to implementing such a program in its AIP program where it makes sense to do so.  Guidance on structuring such a program would be of benefit.

2)	Section 26.45 - Goal Submission – It is challenging to set an overall goal for three years at our airport since the type of projects to be awarded may vary from one year to the next.  Setting the overall goals on an annual basis for a three year period is preferable, however forecasting which projects will be undertaken during the three years period is difficult and would most likely lead to annual adjustments every year.  Nevertheless, we would prefer setting the goals on an annual basis for a three year period rather than submitting a single goal for a three year period.

3)	Section 26.47 – Failure to Meet Goals – We believe that the requirement to perform an analysis and plan for corrective action for failure to meet goals will be a difficult process.  We currently require the submission of bidders list and note the number of DBE firms vs. non-DBE firms submitting bids as opposed to those performing work.  A rigorous process will be required to accomplish such an analysis and then to formulate corrective actions.  We do not believe that 60 days from the end of the fiscal year provides sufficient time to successfully accomplish this, particularly since the airport is also required to develop and submit its accomplishment report during that time period.  We request that the Department consider extending the timeline for the required analysis and plan to at least 60 days after the submission of the accomplishment report.

Thank you for the opportunity to submit these comments.",,,,,,,

In many ways I am thanklfull for that, we had no dependancy on set asides and we won our state and local business by beating out competitors. Now doing millions of dollars and growing from me to 30 we stand stronger and taller on our own. Many organizations that grow on this support will not learn how to win on there own and will fail when they out grow it. Finally any assistance must be reserved for the very smallest business's there is nothing wrong with the 750k net worth this does not need to get larger most realty has dropped making this number bigger than it was before the down turn. I also think companies that can cross state lines should also not need this level of support and should be excluded or only able to qualify in a single state. How can you claim you a DBE but your chasing business all over the country.",,,,,,,

FROM CONNECTICUT


Accountability for Recipients With Respect to Overall Goals
•	The DBE utilization report requires that recipients report on DBE “awards and commitments” and “actual payments”.  If recipients are being held accountable for achieving goals on awards and commitments, and not on actual achievements the questions must be asked; are we are truly leveling the playing field or just encouraging race conscious goals over race neutral goals.  This change if enacted will serve to convert the overall goal to an overall Set-Aside, basically doing away with the race neutral part of the DBE program and possibly opening the program to further legal challenges.  This runs counter to the narrowly-tailored nature of the DBE Program.  As proposed, there is no opportunity for a Recipient to document Good Faith Effort (GFE) in any given year of the three-year overall goal.  The USDOT is using language in this section such as “must” and “required” is reflective of a set-aside program and not a goal program.  Since the Recipient has to achieve the overall goal each year or take corrective actions to achieve the Overall Goal the following year, the overall goal will become an Overall Set-Aside.  As proposed, recipients will not be encouraged to find innovative avenues to truly level the playing field but efforts will be solely focused upon setting project goals on projects, whether or not they are achievable, to satisfy the accountability requirements of the regulations.   We do not agree with this approach.
•	In lieu of the proposed.   If a recipient fails to achieve their overall goal,   they could develop an internal work plan for their agency to increase DBE participation.  This plan should include a section for “innovative approaches to level the playing field”.  The work plan should also require the recipient to review the overall goal to see if adjustments are necessary, if it is determined that the goal needs to be adjusted, the recipient would submit the revised goal along with the justification to the appropriate DOT agency.  If at the end of FY3 the recipient fails to achieve the overall goal they would submit copies of their work plans and progress towards goal achievement.   

Goal Submission
•	The USDOT proposes to make the Recipient responsible for “good faith implementation” of the Overall Goal in each of the three years.  
	
	If a recipient fails to achieve their overall goal, they would develop an internal work plan for their agency to increase DBE participation.  This plan should include a section for “innovative approaches to level the playing field”.  The work plan should also require the recipient to review the overall goal to see if adjustments are necessary.   If it is determined that the goal needs to be adjusted, the recipient would submit the revised goal along with the justification to the appropriate DOT agency.  If at the end of FY3 the recipient fails to achieve the overall goal they would submit copies of their work plans and outline their progress towards goal achievement.   




Improving Oversight
•	We agree with the DOT’s attempt to strengthen the Recipient’s responsibility to perform CUF reviews;
•	The language regarding the Recipient having adequate staff to administer the DBE Program needs to be more clearly defined.  To administer the program in accordance with the regulations and the spirit in which the program was developed requires appropriate resources.  Unfortunately, the administration of the DBE Program is not always viewed as an economic development program or a requirement for DOT funding, but is viewed as an auxiliary, or social services program.  When resources are allocated many times these programs receive minimal or no resources.  If these programs are going to accomplish what they were created to achieve and have any permanent impact adequate resources must be allocated.  
•	These programs can be greatly impacted by a Recipient’s change in CEOs.  While the regulations may not change, the CEOs view of the importance of the program may. These types of fluctuations could have a significant impact on a recipients program.  Therefore it is extremely important that the regulations be clear and that new executive staff be required to have training.  This training would be best provided by DOT personnel, and should clarify the required roles and responsibilities of the CEO and the DBELO.  It is important that people who have the ability to make decisions that will impact the program, understand the intent of the program and its requirements. 

Personal Net Worth
•	A 73% adjustment will work to markedly increase the number of applicants to the DBE Program.  It is true that the cap was set based upon 1989 numbers, but the practical application through the continued deduction of the applicant-owner’s primary residence and interest in the business serves to reinforce that the $750,000 cap is an effective cap to maintain.  If the USDOT is going to adjust the PNW cap, why not use the $1,000,000 cap offered under the previous FAA (49 CFR Part 23) DBE Program.  This will serve to increase the PNW cap and almost split the difference; and
•	PNW & Retirement Savings: Applicants presently use shelters most often through the establishment of Trusts to creatively allocate assets.  To simplify application evaluations, all retirement savings plans should be counted as assets.  This will eliminate the need to exempt certain plans and will work to address applicants inappropriately sheltering assets to exclude them from PNW consideration.  
•	We do not agree with using CPI as the adjustment vehicle, as this does not provide for the disparity in wealth between the presumed groups and non-presumed groups.  We would recommend that DOT perform an analysis of the PNW for firms currently certified in the program, and conduct a study to determine the impact of raising the PNW, particularly as it relates to start-up businesses.  We have only had two firms over the last two years who have become ineligible for certification due to exceeding the PNW requirements of the DBE program.  Additionally, we have observed a disparity in the PNW between certain presumed groups within the DBE program which may be further impacted by this change.


Interstate Certification and Related Issues
•	The proposed Rebuttable Presumption Reciprocity System will have the practical impact of flooding the DBE Programs with applications.  As long as a firm is certified in one State, this will enable the DBE firm to now apply to 49 remaining States and DC and Puerto Rico.  If a State presently has 350 firms certified (for example) this number could expand exponentially skewing the Overall Goals.  
•	The opportunity for fraud will increase because the Recipient will find it much simpler to either certify the applicants or not to respond at all (which under this proposal means that the applicant is certified).  The increase in administrative time to hold ineligibility meetings will become extremely burdensome to states.  It should be noted that not all UCPs hold firms seeking certification to all of the regulatory requirements.  There are varied approaches to certification and how the regulations are applied depends upon the education and experience of a given certification specialist.   The change in process will not free up resources presently allocated to DBE certification, but will most likely need to increase the need for personnel resources to accommodate the increased administrative burden.    If one were to add all these considerations together, the opportunities for the certification of fraudulent firms will greatly increase.  Currently, we are experiencing a larger number of firms set up to take advantage of program that do not meet the criteria for certification.   
•	DBE firms should bear the burden of proof in these eligibility proceedings.
•	The time period is not acceptable.  With current staffing levels it would be almost impossible to review home-state applications and out-of-state applications within the prescribed time-lines.  This will certainly create pressure on states, and diminish the integrity of the certification process.  Firms are not always forthcoming with information that may bring question to their eligibility.  A thorough review of an application must be made to insure that only firms that should benefit from the program benefit.  Currently, some communities are concerned about the lack of opportunities that they have received under this program.  The proposed changes could make this more of an issue, as firms that are not socially and economically disadvantaged could be become certified through default, and further dilute the opportunities available to those firms who should benefit from the program. 
•	These changes will also impact the overall goals with the influx of applications, as many firms will seek to be certified in all states regardless as to whether they plan to perform work in the state or not.   If DOT implements this proposed change, a recommendation should be made that the national goal be reinstituted, as the current overall goal setting process may become invalid and the availability numbers may become skewed.  
•	Firms that appeal a state’s decision to deny or remove certification to DOT, should lose certification under each UCP under which they are certified; if DOT upholds the state’s decision to deny or remove eligibility under size, ownership, control, or social and economic disadvantage. 






Fostering Small Business Participation
What we have heard from the DBE community is that some prime contractors will require bonding as a tool to negotiate contract disputes.  Rather the negotiating with the DBE firm to resolve contract disputes, the prime will go after the bond; affecting the DBE firm’s ability to obtain future bonding and credit.  We are not sure how common the practice has become. 

Terminations and Substitutions of DBE Subcontractors

Counting Issue
We agree with the current regulation.

Application and PNW Forms
•	If the USDOT in whole or in part adopts the Interstate Certification process, there will need to be clarification as to what forms are acceptable and which forms will need to be updated.   

Certification-Related Provisions
•	We agree with the DOT’s proposal to expand upon the DBE applicant’s responsibility to supply detailed information for the UCP to assign an appropriate NAICS Code and with the responsibility to present up-to-date information;
•	While in the proposed rules it is acknowledged that reciprocity could raise concerns about firms engaging in forum shopping to find “easy graders”, this proposal may create the same outcome.  Particularly since you won’t need a warehouse, equipment ect. business can almost operate virtually with a post office box.
•	We do not agree that an applicant should be allowed to not have an inventory and warehouse if it is applying as a Supplier or that an applicant should not be required to have equipment either owned by the applicant or long-term leased from a firm other than the prime contractor as a measure of DBE eligibility.  If a firm is applying as a Broker, then a telephone, computer, and Office space rented (or at home) may be sufficient.  In the case of applicants for Suppliers and Contractors, there does need to be a minimum amount of expectations that an applicant is expected to realize.  This section needs to be revised accordingly.  Additionally, this is the first time that we have heard from the DOT that the DBE Program serves as “an incubator for start-up businesses”.  The only mention presently of business development in 49 CFR Part 26 is in Appendix C.  If the DOT is transitioning the DBE Program to a USSBA-type business program, there will need to be a great deal more focus by Recipients on implementing Appendix C and a much greater level of funding will need to be provided either by Recipients or FHWA (and especially FTA and FAA) to make this a reality;  
•	Creating a 3-5 year interval between on-site reports will have a significant resource impact (especially if the Interstate Certification construct is in any way implemented).  We agree that on-site reports need to be updated, but that the interval should be every five to seven years and not every three to five years.  Regarding use of videoconferencing or other technologies, these media do not replace the actual on-site visual inspection necessary to confirm that an applicant has an office/business site, inventory, sufficient equipment, etc.  The actual interview may be conducted via other media, but the visual on-site inspection cannot be replaced and will need to be performed by the Home State Recipient.  Regarding charging user fees to applicants, we support this proposal if the Interstate Certification proposal is implemented in any form.  Finally, additional documentation can not replace the visual on-site inspection.

Before consideration of interstate certification, the US DOT should provide a ""uniform"" certification training to the certifyers across the country. A regular training of the trainers to lay the foundation of conducting a certification. This would be helpful to the certifier and the certification agencies, who don't work which each other on a regular basis. Also, it gives eveyone a foundation on the expectations of doing certification. A certifyer / certification agency should also go through a ""update"" process to ensure it ""qualifies"" with US DOT to continue doing certifications.",,,,,,,

I disagree with rasing the PNW from 750,000 to 1.3 million. In my opinion, it creates a larger ""program within a program"" of DBE firms. The owners that exceed this eligibility requirement have grown their companies to ""compete in the mainstream"" and should be graduated from the program. The larger the DBE firms, the more opportunities it potentially can take away from middle and smaller firms. A higher PNW eligibility requirment, potentially keeps larger firms in the program. Also, a higher PNW allows new firms that have not learned to hide assets, into the program, which can lead to DBE fraud.",,,,,,,

These are the criteria by which costs are minimized, leading to higher cost effectiveness and profitability, which may lead to more employment - and minorities are the direct beneficiary of transportation employment. 

     In a time when America is financially hurting, any rule changes that would allocate business on anyother basis but quality and cost-effectiveness, only creates higher costs, which lead to higher taxes (to finance the inneficiencies) and higher unemployment when further cost-cutting becomes necessary. This creates an entitlement system where minorities with a business and political pull receive entitlements while the poorer working minority actually working as a transportation worker, gets laid off because of the cumulative effect of cost inneficiencies. 

     So once again, any rule change that would award business by any criteria other than cost- benefit should be voted down. This is morally correct also as it refuses to discriminate by race, ethnicity, or sex.",,,,,,,

My grandson (10yrs old) has an extremely serious peanut allergy.  Because of peanuts being served on airlines, we cannot take the chance..again.. of flying with him to visit relatives.  Once before, we requested a peanut free flight because of this situation.  We paid more money for this flight because the airline said they did not serve peanuts.  What we discovered is that this was not the case.  Peanuts were served on the flight to everyone around us.  We were petrified that he would have an attack before we reached our destination.  Luckily, it was a short flight and although he did have a reaction it was not life threatening...this time...  Not only is there a danger if peanuts are served on the flight, but also any residue from peanuts served on previous flights can cause an allergy attack.  I would hope that they would remove all peanut products from this service ...replace with pretzels or chips.  At least, for our family, it would eliminate the fear of flying.

Thanks you for allowing me the opportunity of sharing my experience and thoughts on the subject",,,,,,,

I propose that peanuts and peanut-product-containing substances (but not necessarily those with only peanut oil--the allergen is usually a protein not present in high-quality oil) be banned from airplanes in the sense that cigarettes/cigars/pipe tobacco etc. are ""banned."" In other words, you may carry the items on board but you can't use them. It is not carrying a bag of peanuts that is the potential problem, it is opening it and potentially putting peanut dust or other particles into the air. I doubt that someone eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich a few rows away would really be an issue, but why not be safe instead of sorry...and also make the rule easier to enforce? Just like the ""no smoking"" rule.
Several airlines have already given up serving peanuts (perhaps as a cost issue, more than anything); perhaps all should.
I doubt if the peanut-grower lobby could object too vigorously, because I would think the economic value of peanuts served on airplanes would be minimal in the overall use of peanuts.
Also, it would pay to inquire whether persons allergic to peanuts (a New World legume) are also allergic to nuts (i.e., things that grow on trees). I don't think you will find many allergic to both, so other ""nuts"" would be ok to serve (except, of course, if one is highly allergic to tree nuts).

The risk ito a passenger is high given the fact that epi-pens or other epinephrine injectors have a limited effect, and the usual medical instruction is to get to an emergency room within 10 or 15 minutes of its use. Not generally possible if you are on a plane!

Just because we haven't heard in the press recently about anyone dying from a peanut on a plane, do we need that to happen before a sensible rule is in place? I doubt you will find a volunteer.",,,,,,,

Full fare disclosure is very important. I search the internet for pricing and it's very frustrating to think you've found a good fare, only to find out that there's an additional, sometimes very substantial, amount of money required for taxes, surcharges, seat assignments, booking on line, booking by phone, luggage, etc. This should be required of all sites, not just the airline sites. 

Refunding luggage fees seems to be a logical thing to do when and airline loses you luggage. They shouldn't be charging for the luggage in the first place! And especially not for carry on luggage!

Please don't ban peanuts. If you do that, I'm afraid to think of what else would be banned because some people may be allergic to it. Banning perfume and aftershave/cologne would be good. Lots of people have allergy/asthma attacks when some people seem to 'bathe' in cologne.

Really kind, helpful people are all we need but airline travel is so stressful these days NOBODY cares too much about whether peanuts can kill a fellow passenger (even a child). It's just not their problem.  We find peanuts in the seat, in the magazine pockets, packets half-eaten on the floor. We wipe everything down, cover the chair with a sheet , stress my kid must not touch anything. We bring multiple EpiPens, steroids etc. While gluten-free meals, vegetaran, diabetic meals etc have been provided for years, a peanut-free meal is an impossiblity.  I am happy to bring my child's food, drink, medicine what ever he needs but please don't continue to force us to walk the peanut tightrope - without much of a safety net given the length of flights- every time we travel. We can't even have my child accept a drink of water from the stewards after the time he went into anaphylaxis after accepting a cup of water from a steward who had been cleaning up peanut packages and had peanut on her hands.  I have never been so frightened because it was a long-haul flight. I have to persuade security to allow me to bring water onto the plane now (more than 4oz is a problem).  Everyone wants to feel safe. Removing peanuts would be the most effective way to achieve safey for peanut allergic passengers (which are only going to increase in number).

The number of children alone that are diagnosed with severe nut allergies is increasing dramatically every year. My two young sons both have life-threatening nut allergies and only have a 20% chance of ever outgrowing. Even if they do outgrow it, the allergy itself can return at any time without any warning. My youngest son has had an allergic reaction to the smell of peanuts in the past. At this point, the airlines can not be trusted to ensure peanuts are removed or not served during a specific flight, even when proper medical  documentation is provided in advance. My family will not fly at all until peanuts are banned.  
Customers that board these modes of transportation should be thrown off the flight or charged a huge fine. If others don't feel it's a serious enough issue, just ask them to send their three year old out on the interstate to play - the odds of them being killed is about the same as if my son steps on a plane.

Unfortunately, problems sometime arise, and airlines have to deal with those problems in a way that will prevent legal action from being taken upon them.  Any marketer is always the one who is most concerned with the perception of their product, and airline marketers dread these poorly received tarmac delays. 

In a market economy, competition and new entrants keep incumbent firms on their toes with regards to service, quality, cost, and delivery.  Making the waters of rules and regulations more difficult to navigate will only further discourage new entrants into the market, thus raising prices by incumbent firms. While regulations seem to be fighting for the little guy, they only serve to entrench the incumbent firms into their market places.  Encouraging new entrants to a market is by far the single most good you can do for the consumer. Unfortunately all of these proposed regulations do the exact opposite.",,,,,,,

Currently there are millions of Americans with peanut allergies.  Peanuts on airplanes have been proven to be a risk of causing anaphylaxis in peanut-allergic individuals.  This limits where peanut-allergic people can go and what we can do.  

My son has multiple food allergies including peanuts and I can't tell you the fear we have when we fly.  We avoid planes but sometimes there is no other option.

If it were only affecting a small % of the population that would be one thing but peanut allergy affects millions of people and is growing with the number of those affected increasing at a very rapid rate.  Right now according to research 1 in 17 children have a food allergy and half of those have peanut allergies.  When large numbers of people open peanut packages on airplanes at the same time it can release enough peanut protein to get into planes air filtration systems and cause anaphylaxis in those allergic to it.  Many airlines not only regularly serve packaged p peanuts but also refuse to accommodate those with peanut allergy.  They refuse to not serve peanuts on each and every flight.  At the very least I would like to see airlines required to refrain from serving packages of peanuts if there is a peanut-allergic individual on board.  What is more important--a person's life or little bags of peanuts?

I am an adult with a severe peanut allergy.  Unlike other food allergies, peanuts cannot be avoided by simply not eating them.  The scent, which can be quite concentrated on a small plane with recirculated air, can cause severe reactions to someone with a peanut allergy.  I have the choice of not eating peanuts on an airplane, but I have no choice about the air I breathe for the duration of a flight. The scent of peanuts can trigger hives, and more severe symptoms, including the inability to breathe. I carry an Epi-Pen, but use of it is not as simple as some think.  Its use can also bring on severe reactions and has long lasting effects.  
If I'm on a flight where peanuts are served, I am forced to cover my mouth and nose with my sleeve for the duration of the flight.  Not attractive, or practical.  I would like to think I could put up with not eating, drinking, or smoking something that my fellow passengers could find offensive, or in my case life threatening, for the length of an airline flight.

Basically this is where the throat closes up cutting off air supply, the heart rate drops which can result in heart failure. 100 people die each year from peanut allergy. Peanut allergies have tripled in the last 10 years. I have attached a letter that I am still waiting on response from the DOT regarding a flight from Hawaii to Phoenix in which we were discriminated. 

If you don't care for a child's life, then you should also consider the adverse economic effect of not only the 12 million Americans with food allergy they potentially can't fly the ""friendly"" skies, but all of their family members that are also not flying along with them. Because my son has a life threatening peanut allergy...that now excludes all 4 of us. Not only are the airlines being effected, but tourism. We have money to spend to travel, but don't because it's not worth my child's life!

I am the local Walk Chair for FAAN's Walk for Food Allergy in Arizona. I am a housewife and do this on a strictly volunteer basis.

First, the incidence of severe peanut allergies are increasing yearly, especially amongst children.  It is only a matter of time before a child suffers a fatal reaction while airborne.  Second, while a ban will, of course, not prevent every individual from bringing peanuts on board, having an airline ban will severely lower the risk of a fatal reaction.  There is a significantly lower risk involved when a few passengers bring peanuts on board, vs. having 200 passengers simultaneously open peanut packets in the closed air of a plane, sending a cloud of peanut dust into the atmosphere and ensuring that many surfaces, doorknobs, etc. host peanut protein.  Further, it is the correct action to take in a civilized community.  No-one of any merit can seriously protest having to forego free peanuts for 6 hours to ensure that anaphalactic children can safely travel.  Unlike smoking, peanuts are not an addictive substance, and it is a miniscule societal price to pay.  No allergic person seriously believes that banning peanuts is a 100% guarantee of safety -- however we all concur that such a ban will significantly lower the incidence of peanut reactions and fatalities, will provide less stressful travel, and will lower the chances of interrupted flights due to medical emergencies for all travelers.  A peanut ban is the right thing to do.",,,,,,,

My daughter has potentially life threatening food allergies to multiple sources, with one of the worst allergies being to peanuts. Imagine how frightening it is to then get on an airline with her where everyone is munching on a substance that could be lethal to her if it is introduced to her system. It is absolutely terrifying to think what might happen if we were up in the air and she were to have a reaction. It is not uncommon for her to experience a severe degree of itching and discomfort on planes, which I suspect may be due to the covering of the seats of peanut residue. Granted, we always carry her epi-pen with us when we fly, but that is a lot of trust for a parent to put into a vial of a medication to save their children's life at 10,000 feet in the air. As a result of our concerns, we drive most places. Our daughter would love to rather go in an airplane, however, it doesn't seem like a responsible position for a parent to put their allergic child in. We have requested that the airline not serve peanuts when we have flown and we have experienced one of two things happening, either the airline goes ahead and serves it anyway or there is a severe degree of hostility from other passengers.

1) Banning the serving of peanuts and 
all peanut products by both U.S. and foreign carriers on flights 
covered by DOT's disability rule.  There are other snack options, such as pretzels, that are just as easy to serve, economical and safe for allergic individuals.
2) I think it is difficult to control if other passengers bring peanut products onto an aircraft.  If someone with a peanut allergy notices a passenger near them, and the person is not willing to avoid eating the peanut product, re-seating the allergic person as far from the other individual would be an option.

3)Some people can be around peanut dust/smells without reacting, or at least not reacting violently.  Some people cannot.  My concern with peanut products on an airplane is that the air is recycled - so the smell would be constant throughout the flight.

4)  There should be an epinephrine auto-injector available on all flights.  Individuals with severe peanut allergies should have two epinephrine on them at all times.  I feel that it is their responsibility to do so.  However, having a backup form of epinephrine is important too, as each shot will only buy someone in anaphylaxis approximately 15 minutes.

5) Anything that includes peanut products, crackers, peanut oils, etc should be included in the ban.  

6)  My personal feeling is that if it has actual peanut products in it, i.e. peanut butter crackers, peanuts, trail mix, granola bars with nuts, food cooked in peanut oil - it should be included in the ban.  However, foods such as pretzels that carry a warning on the package that says ""may contain peanuts"" or ""produced in the same facility/on the same line as peanut products"" don't need to be included.  As long as the passenger is able to see the warning on the package, it is their responsibility to decide if it is something that is safe for them to consume.",,,,,,,

I desire to comment on protecting peanut allergic airline passengers.  My 7 year-old son has severe peanut allergies.  I always carry epi-pens and Benedryl in case of accidental allergic reactions.  I am afraid to let my son fly, as passengers bring peanuts on to the planes and we were told that the airlines can do nothing to stop people from bringing peanuts on planes.  I do believe my son should have the right not to be exposed to peanuts in a confined air space.  Epi-pens will not be enough if a peanut allergic person has a reaction.  The protocol is that 911 must be called after a severe reaction and an EMT who is trained in giving epinipherine should come and the person must be rushed to the hospital.  I am afraid of what would happen to my son if there wer 200 people eating peanuts and it was all over the seats.  There are plenty of other snack people can eat besides peanuts.  I am in favor of banning peanuts and peanut butter products of any kind on planes.  My son could die from ingesting peanuts and I don't want to take the chance of him coming in contact with peanuts in a confined space.  He and other peanut allergic individuals have the right to be protected by congress and the airlines, as not being able to breath should fall under the definition of disability.  I am appalled that congress would not consider it so, I am sure if one of their children was severely allergic to peanuts they would care.  Congress and the FAA needs to put themselves in the shoes of those who have to live with food allergies and worry about what is in food every day.  I do agree that peanut allergice passengers should provide their own epipens, but that additional epiniphrine should be available if needed.  Solving the problem is simple:  ban all peanuts, including products with peanut oil, peanut butter on flights.  Thank you for considering my comments.  Laura Shinn",,,,,,,

That Airline is Air Tran and we are very thankful that they do not serve peanuts on their flights.  Other airlines that have adopted ""Buffer Zone"" policies are completely unacceptable to us, hundreds of people opening peanut packages on an aircraft pollute the air of that aircraft, and certainly having just three ""peanut-free"" rows in front of and behind a peanut-allergic person is absolutely ineffective and does not help us at all.

Our only trusted airline does not fly to Hawaii.  As you can see we are extremely limited and forced to drive long distances or leave our child home when we want to vacation.  It is more than unfortunate as this situation is so easily corrected.  I believe airlines can go a long way to truly convincing the public that they are commited to customer service and caring about their passengers by banning peanuts on aircraft.  I also believe if this is not going to be a voluntary exercise that it should absolutely be regulated by the government to protect peanut allergic citizens.  With so much evidence about the dangers of peanut exposure for allergic individuals, I can't believe it is even in debate.  Thank you for your consideration.

My son has a life-threatening allergy to peanuts and has had multiple contact reactions (reaction to touching a peanut product).  For individuals with contact or airborne sensitivity, even the residue of a peanut product can cause a life-threatening reaction. While we always carry Epi-pens and Benadryl, in a true anaphylactic emergency each Epi-pen only buys you 15-20 minutes, and the person then requires IV treatment at a hospital. Not easily done on a plane! This is one of the few conditions/reactions that is 1) easily preventable and 2) hard to treat outside a hospital once triggered. Some may ask ""If you're going to ban peanuts, why not other foods?"" While there may be anaphylactic reactions other foods, it is more likely to require actual consumption for a reaction. It's the oil in peanuts and nuts that can cause contact reactions, and it's VERY difficult to clean and remove. I would propose that airlines serve products that do not contain actual nuts. While many products are cross-contaminated, these would not cause contact or airborne reactions. ""Safe zones"" do not work since peanuts were served on the previous flight. Cleaning the plane between flights is very costly and time-consuming to do well enough to remove nut oil. We understand that people may still bring nuts on a flight, but I would hope that an announcement that a severely allergic person was on board would cause then to refrain from eating it on the flight.  I know if I heard someone's life was in danger, I would be happy to wait until I was off the plane.  There was a study published in 2008 that found nut-allergic individuals had an in-flight reaction 10% of the time [Reference: Allergic reactions to peanuts, tree nuts, and seeds aboard commercial airline, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1868108].

Our family attempts to travel on commercial airlines who do not serve peanut products on their flights, but with increasing airline consolidation this provides us with fewer and fewer choices for travel.  

Indeed, this consolidation threatened my child's safety in a very specific way last year- we had purchased a ticket to travel on Northwest Airlines (a peanut-free airline), which was being acquired by Delta Airlines.  Unknown to us, our travel date was one day after Delta had implemented its own peanut policy on Northwest flights and began serving peanuts on Northwest flights.  My son had a severe, life-threatening reaction during the flight that required our administering his epi-pen.  

Peanut allergies are a very serious, life-threatening condition for many people.  Putting peanuts in a confined environment such as an airplane at 40,000 feet places peanut-allergic individuals at significant risk (as was our family's experience).  There are suitable snack alternatives for passenger's comfort on flights that do not require airlines to serve peanuts- there is no degradation in airline service as a result of not having peanuts on board. 

While we do acknowledge that such a ban will not reduce all risk of peanut allergic reactions in flight (customers may continue to bring their own peanut products on board planes), such a measure would significantly reduce the risk to peanut allergice individuals.  

We strongly encourage this ban of peanuts on commercial airlines to move forward.  With airline consolidation diminishing the number of travel choices for peanut-allergic individuals, there is no justifiable reason to place an increasing percentage of the flying public at risk for the sake of a snack food, particularly when other suitable alternatives exist.",,,,,,,

I would like to write regarding Docket No. DOT-OST-2010-0140.  Specifically, I would like to address the proposed ban on peanuts in flight.

I have suffered from many food allergies since childhood, but my nut allergies are by far the worst.  I have had several experiences on planes when I have had to take Benadryl, an inhaler, and/or an Epi-pen because of excessive amounts of nut particles in the air that have triggered my anaphalaxis.  I have, on occasion, locked myself in the bathroom while sucking an inhaler in an attempt to limit my exposure to the allergen.

I do not have the milder reaction of merely getting hives and sneezing when exposed to these nuts; my throat and lungs close off and I can not breathe.  I can't begin to tell you how frustrating it is to be trapped in what is, for me, a metal tube full of poisonous air thousands of feet in the air.  You can not open a window, you can not get out, and you can not breathe.

I realize that many people enjoy nuts, especially peanuts, and that many people's livelihoods depend upon the sale of this product.  However, my LIFE depends upon the regulation of it.  I have to deal with unintended nut exposure in lotions, tissues, foods, shampoos, etc., on a daily basis.  I try to take all of this in stride, because I know that I am in the minority and that I can get away, if need be.  However, a plane is an enclosed space that I feel warrants special consideration.

I would greatly appreciate your banning, in particular, peanuts and macademia nuts (often found on Hawaiian bound flights) from all U.S. air travel.  I would also appreciate a proviso, which Jetblue has offered, to make an announcement to passengers when a nut allergy sufferer is on the plane, asking other passengers to limit consuming nuts that they have brought with them (Jetblue often offers them a replacement pack of pretzels or cookies). 

Thank you.",,,,,,,

Both my sons are allergic to peanuts and travelling on airlines is very stressful because of the great danger it poses for them.  Just yesterday I called American Airlines about an upcoming flight and asked if they could not serve nuts on the flight and/or if they could make an announcement to other passengers making them aware of the food allergy on the plane so they would be less likely to eat their peanuts.  I was told that it is not their policy and they will not do it.  I then emailed them and got a similar response.  It is such a small inconvenience for most, and could potentially avert a severe reaction from a peanut allergy sufferer who is stuck in an airplane with no immediate access to medical care were a reaction to hit.  It is not just the peanut dust that is a worry, but people touching peanuts, and touching their seats, door handles, dropping nuts on the floor, the seats, etc.  I fully support a ban on peanuts and/or an accomodation for those suffering from food allergies.

I would like to express my support for the proposal, as the benefit of making airline travel safer for people with peanut allergies (who don't need to ingest a peanut to suffer a reaction, and whose reactions are often severe and can cause death) far outweigh the inconveniences of the airlines having to choose another snack to serve.

Those of us supporting this proposal are not demanding that peanuts be banned altogether (i.e., passengers would still be allowed to bring their own), but simply that they not be served by the airlines since hundreds of passengers opening bags, eating peanuts and spreading their debris onto surfaces and into the ventilation system results in a MUCH more dangerous environment. I also think that even people who enjoy peanuts would rather suffer a minor inconvenience of being served another snack like pretzels, than witnessing a small child suffer a major medical emergency at 30,000 feet, hoping he doesn't die in front of them.

I have contacted Delta airlines (the biggest carrier, and with by far the most flights in our region [Midwest]) with my concerns and hoped that they would be more reasonable and make the change to stop SERVING peanuts on their flights. But thus far the results have been very disappointing, as there has been no indication that they're willing to consider making this change in the name of safety.",,,,,,,

The occurrence of an allergic reaction on a plane causes a disruption for everyone.  There are plenty of other options for snacks on planes.  The incidence of food allergies is increasing.  The safest way to decrease exposure and reduce liability is to completely ban peanuts and tree nuts on planes.

This comment pertains to the restriction of peanuts on airlines to accommodate passenger's with peanut allergies.

To the peanut industry and growers:  I wish I could eat peanuts.  They are a favorite of several friends and family members.  I can't be in the room when they're consumed; it's no fault of the peanut or y'all.
To the doctor (or anyone) who indicated reactions on airlines are minor:  I nearly passed out, unable to breathe, during my last flight - it was supposed to be peanut free.  Routinely, I carry a rescue inhaler, Epi-Pen, and wear a mask, during and after snack time, designed to keep out particles 5 microns in size.  I used my inhaler; I put on my mask; my lips and tongue swelled; I had difficulty breathing with coughing - my start of wheezing - the remaining 4 hours of flight time.  You try it before you call it minor.
I'm sorry to agree, but I think the airlines should come up with other snacks.  I have the same problem with the wheat crackers and pretzel snacks.  unfortunately, I'm allergic to wheat too.
How about nut-free fresh fruit or dried fruit - without nitrites, of course?
Thanks for the opportunity to comment.",,,,,,,

As you consider Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections, I ask that you give careful thought to the possibility of banning peanuts from airlines. My son is 3 years old and has multiple serious allergies, including to peanuts. In addition, he is asthmatic. The prospect of our child having an anaphylactic reaction in flight due to the presence of peanuts on the plane is a very scary and dangerous possibility. We do all that we can to protect him, including wiping down the armrests and tray, and making sure that he has safe food to consume during the flight, but as long as peanuts are allowed on board he will be at risk. There are so many children and adults who grapple with peanut allergy today. I ask that you consider how to make these passengers safer, allowing that it may inconvenience those who enjoy consuming peanuts. Passenger safety should be the priority.
Thanks for your consideration.",,,,,,,

As I flight attendant for a major airline, I am concerned about the possibility of a potential ban on peanuts and nut containing products on board any aircraft.  I do understand the need to provide a safe atmosphere for all passengers but I think of the extreme liability posed to the airlines, crew members, and other passengers if such a ban is passed.  It is impossible to create a ""nut free"" environment.  Flight attendants have many other duties to perform to ensure the safe passage of customers and would not have the time or resources to ""police"" passengers who may have brought nut products on board.  Most airlines now set up a ""nut free buffer zone"" and do not serve nut products in that area.  In my years of flying I have never had any customers who have had allergic reactions under a ""nut free buffer zone"" policy (including those with self disclosed ""severe nut allergies"").  It has also been my experience that most passengers will identify themselves as having the appropriate means to take care of anaphylactic shock (a condition flight attendants are well trained to handle under FAA certification standards).  The imposing of a ban of peanut products would be a needless hassle.",,,,,,,

I read today in the paper how breathing peanut dust on a plane usually causes a minor reaction of sneezing or itching and coughing. I am alive today to tell a vastly different story. 

I was on a flight from St. Louis to Oakland CA where peanuts we're being served. To my horror when I got on the plane I found my seat on the full flight already covered in peanut husks from the previous customer. The guy next to my gobbled at least two packs of peanuts while I tried to press myself to the opposite side of the seat. He'd rumple his coat under the seat and bring up a cloud of peanut dust. The flight had a stop in Salt Lake which became a 2 hour hold over in the plane due to thunderstorms. My lungs where aching from the peanuts requiring multiple hits from my albuteol. By the time the plane left Salt Lake I was in dire trouble gasping for air. I had to use my epipen which seeming had no effect because I was still in a toxic atmosphere of peanuts. By the time I made it to Oakland I had to be rushed directly to the hospital ER. I don't remember because I'd lost consciousness from anaphylaxis. my fiends had to carry me into the ER. They said I was blue. I nearly died. I'm lucky to be alive.

I called the airline about the problem. I was told that people like peanuts and tough cookies on getting them off the plane or even requesting a peanut free zone, which wouldn't work because they're airborne in dust! I was offered no compensation for my nightmare flight. I haven't flown since.

Sincerely

I can certainly understand the needs of those with food allergies, as I discovered about a year ago that I have Celiac Disease, an autoimmune disease triggered by eating wheat, rye, or barley gluten.

I am concerned that banning peanuts on airline flights will drive airlines to offer more foods with gluten in them.  It is hard enough to get a snack on a flight that I can eat without removing gluten.  In fact, I recently wrote to Alaska Airlines asking them to provide a gluten-free option, since they serve a snack mix in lieu of peanuts.

I saw a news story about this rulemaking and the reporter cited a statistic that as many as 1.8 million people have peanut allergies.  However, a recent New England Journal of Medicine article estimated that as many as 1% of the population (or upwards of 30 million Americans) have gluten intolerances.

As you make this rule, please be aware of unintended consequences.  If you ban peanuts on airplane flights, while it may help those who suffer from peanut allergies, it will incentivize airlines to offer (in all likelihood) wheat-based snack alternatives, which will hurt those of us who can eat peanuts but not wheat.

Thank you for your consideration.  Please contact me if you have more questions.",,,,,,,

On behalf of my young children, who, like millions of others, suffer from a severe, life-threatening peanut allergy, I respectfully request that peanuts and peanut products be banned from US and non-US flights that are covered by the DOT's disability rule. While by some measures, the number of individuals who suffer from serious peanut allergy may be small, it is critical to understand that accidental ingestion of a small amount of peanut can be fatal to such people.  Measured against the fact that there is no condition (at least of which I am aware) that requires, an individual to eat peanut products on a flight, and it is clear that the benefit of such a rule would outweigh the very temporary and very slight disappointment someone might feel in having to wait a couple of hours to have some peanuts.  Unfortunately, the presence of epinephrine on board is not an absolute protection against an in-flight reaction.  First, it is well known that some reactions ultimately require multiple doses of epinephrine, possibly more than a passenger may have in his or her possession on a flight.  Second, there is a well known risk of secondary (biphasal) reaction, which could occur, again, after available doses of epinephrine have been used.  At a minimum, peanuts and peanut products should be banned (i.e. not served by airlines and not allowed to be carried on) in cases where the airline has been notified in advance that the there will be a passenger with a severe peanut allergy.  If this version of the rule was to be adopted, I would only stress the importance of clear and easily accessible procedures so that affected individuals could provide the required notice to the airline.

Even with this vigilance, our kids have ingested peanuts accidentally, usually when someone else has unknowingly included the item in a recipe or forgotten to clean up after themsleves. Note that this occurs in the best of circumstances. In an airplane where our children cannot physically remove themselves from the peanut smell (think cigarette smoke that wafts into non-smoking aisles) or peanut residue from someone's snack or get adequate medial help within 15 minutes after Epi-pen use, the risk is too great.

My son has a severe peanut allergy and by not serving nuts the probability of a reaction is decreased.  It would be helpful if the airline could make an announcement regarding having an allergic passenger onboard and request people refrain from eating nut products, if possible.  Even if people don’t comply, the risk is lessened than if peanuts are served.  It’s a simply law of probability; the more nuts onboard the aircraft, the more likely a reaction.
We know from experience that “buffer zones” currently employed by airlines do not work to protect allergic individuals.  Upon boarding flights we’ve found peanuts on our seats or floors in our “buffer zone”.  Our son had an allergic reaction on our last Delta flight despite our bringing our own food and cleaning his seat and surrounding areas with Clorox wipes.  He left the “buffer zone” to use the restroom and soon after coughed uncontrollably and his eye swelled. It was terrifying, but fortunately towards the end of the flight, but no reaction can be taken lightly.
Peanuts are so oily; it’s not simply a matter of an allergic person not ingesting them, for people like my son, they can’t even touch peanuts or peanut oil. The oils from peanuts stay on people’s hands which makes everything they touch threatening. The dust from peanuts gets into the air and can cause a reaction.  
The airlines do not adequately clean the buffer zones and when a passenger has to leave the buffer zone to use the restroom or get on or off the plane, they are at risk.  The answer to keeping everyone safe onboard is to simply not serve peanuts. Passengers will survive without peanuts as a snack, but an allergic person may not survive if peanuts are the snack.  The bottom line, a snack on an airplane is just not worth the risk to a child’s life. Please prohibit airlines from serving peanuts.",,,,,,,

Comments on Section 12: Peanut Allergies

My daughter has a severe peanut allergy.  When anyone eats peanut or peanut butter products anywhere with 10 to 12 feet of her in an open room, her airway swells closed within a matter of 3 or 4 minutes.  Due to the seriousness of this, she carries an epi-pen all the time.  However, there is sometimes a rebound reaction 30 to 45 minutes after the injection requiring another injection, which she doesn't always have available.

If it is this bad in an open room, I would expect the exposure risk and range to be much worse in a confined aircraft cabin.  I am not a doctor, but my observations seem to point to the oils or particles becoming airborne after someone eats peanuts and speaks or breaths in the direction of my daughter.  

Any products containing peanuts, peanut butter or peanut oil are likely to cause the reaction.  As such, all products containing peanuts or peanut oil need to be restricted.  Due to the confined area in an aircraft cabin, I don't believe that a peanut free zone is sufficient to protect against exposure.  At a minimum, all such products should be disallowed on a flight if notified in advance.  I do believe it is the passenger's responsibility to carry their own epi-pen.

Some carriers such as Southwest do a great job of handling this now.  They don't serve peanut snacks when notified and they make an announcement requesting passengers not open or consume peanut products.  Other carriers such as Midwest refused to stop serving a snack bar with peanuts even when told of the allergy severity.  American left it up to the flight attendants.

DOT-OST-2010-0140 section 12, peanut allergies, it would be a reasonable accommodation to ask the airlines not to serve peanut products and to ask airport venders not to sell peanut products.  Given the prevalence of severe peanut allergies in our population (this being one of the food allergies least likely to be outgrown and also being one more likely to result in severe outcomes), these accommodations should be applied to all flights.  However, passengers allergic to peanuts could still alert airlines before they fly, so the staff of those particular flight would be aware.  

The food-allergic passengers should bear the responsiblity for carrying diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and epi pens, but it would be common sense for airplanes to also stock these items in their first-aid kids, if they do not already.

My perspective is that of the mother to a child with a severe egg (not peanut) allergy.  I always wince when I am on an airplane and see peanuts served, especially when I see passengers put their fingers with peanut residue on the in-flight magazine or dispose of their empty peanut packets in the seat pockets.  It is impossible for airplanes to be cleaned well enough between flights to remove the potential danger to the next passengers.  Frequently when we fly, I see leftover food (including peanuts) from the previous passengers on the floor or between the seats.  My egg-allergic son had a reaction after touching a small smear of mayonnaise left by a prevoius customer in a restaurant, and that was in an environment where tables are presumably easier to clean and more routinely cleaned.

We have flown 4 flights with my daughter. Only one didn't hand out peanuts around us - and didn't give those passengers an alternative (so they were mad at us!) The other flight told us ""too bad"" and handed peanuts all around us.   1) flight attendants need training on anaphylactic reactions & how severe they are - training should include emergency with epipen, plus ""bedside manner""/sensitivity training (just like they wouldn't call a big person ""fat""). 2) ideally not allow peanuts as a snack on airlines at all. This limits exposure to what other passengers have brought on board. Also ensures you don't have to aggressively clean the surrounding area before the peanut free flight 3) there is no way to not allow others to bring on peanut products - most contain peanut, vs being peanuts which fall and float around easily. 4) passengers should bring their own epipen. I would never use an epipen that wasn't mine as I wouldn't know if it had been handled right/in right temp's etc.  5) provide wipes to passenger to use to wipe down tray/arm rests (or their parent or flight attendant to help with wipe down if allergy person travelling alone).  6) provide a little place mat (there are plastic disposable placemats out there - we've bought them; chick fil a gives them out) 7) Talk with Dr's at Duke who are doing peanut allergy research for more medical/technical info you are asking about - talk with the expert dr's, not just lay people, regarding airborne particles etc.",,,,,,,

I am commenting today on a pressing matter Threatening our society. This matter is Food Allergies,and more importantly people flying with these Allergies. I strongly believe that Peanuts and the other Top 8 allergens Should not be served on flights. This issue is especially important to me because just two years ago I had a horrifying experience on a flight.It all started when I was boarding a plane to my home. I had asked the attendant to tell the captain to make an announcement that guests were not allowed to open any nuts on the flight. The captain made the announcement, and the plane took off. About midway into the flight I smelled something nutty and got out of my seat to investigate. It turns out that in coach seating someone had opened a bag of peanuts despite the captain and the attendant telling him not to. I had to upgrade my seat in the middle of the flight because someone was hungry. I begged the man that was eating the nuts to stop so much that a county commissioner had to use strong words to get him to finally stop. Since this was just one bag of peanuts I did not have an allergic reaction, but I was lucky. This nerve racking experience has scared me for life and I am only twelve. I do not think the government wants to make its citizens at risk any more than the feel now. Please support me in making the lives easier and better for 12,000,000 americans like me.

I am a professional in the field of disability services and I have an airborne allergy to peanuts.  These are my opinions regarding the proposed policy changes:

A buffer-free zone would be a nice gesture, but not effective in a recycled air setting.  Any individual with airborne or tactile reactions would not be protected.  The particles in the other rows would circulate through the air system and peanut traces would be on all the passengers, staff, and equipment.

A peanut-free flight when an identified person with a peanut allergy is on board would protect the individual from an airborne reaction.  Additionally, cleaning the airplane before the flight would remove the residues from previous flights.

Making all flights peanut-free sidesteps the issue.  It eliminates the peanut presence, but it also fails to identify a method to deal with similar disabilities in the future. 

I have not flown in almost a decade because, while this type of has been a protected disability in most legislation, it has not been accommodated in air travel.  People with severe food allergies are a clearly defined disability group and an untapped revenue source for the airline industry, if it is made so we can fly safely. 

I miss flying.  I want to see the world...  I just want to arrive still breathing.  I hope this comes to be more than the token ""buffer zone"" so heavily discussed.  Thanks so much for your time and consideration.

I am not asking for the moon, but would like to cast my vote for the option of having the airline suspend serving peanuts on flights with peanut allergic passengers.

I would think this bill would increase the number of people using air travel and thus a boost for the industry.

- stiffer penalties need to be enacted for being bumped from a flight. This should be delay based (long delays have higher passenger compensation), and being bumped to a next day flight should have extremely high penalties (10-fold or higher) so airlines don't overbook the last flight out
- frequent flyer miles are a sham. when i select an airline, it's with the understanding that 100 miles are worth a certain amount (typically $1). Airlines have been using all kinds of techniques to reduce the value of 100 miles, from increasing the number of miles to redeem a ticket or switching to some silly points system. these point systems are all a fraud. the airlines should be forced to stick with their initial claims of the value of each mile
- when exchanging a ticket, if the new ticket is less expensive than the old ticket, the difference should be applied to the change fee. the fact that this isn't the case now is outright theft in my opinion

The airlines may want to have the same approach to flights. A friend of mine will not fly any more. He is a diabetic and the possibility of the door to the plane being locked and then trapped on the tarmac without taking off and without access to food has in part lead to this decision. Having a daily flight to each city that is allergy free and a flight that is for people with chronic disease. The airlines need to look at nitche services.  The number of potential passengers with peanut allergies may be about 1% but the number of people with various allergies is probably 10%. Special service flights that are allergy free may create a new market but if not provided by all airlines it would be a very loyal customer base. It only takes 1 passenger in a group with an allergy to change the flight of the whole group to that airline. Some people without allergies might like the conditions on the allergy free flight.

I've read some of the commentary with regards to this request for public submissions and I've yet to see one that lists an actual incident. Instead there seems to be quite a bit of dread about what MIGHT happen. But, how often does it actually  happen? How many passengers have been adversely affected by the consumption of peanuts by other passengers? If the complaint is only watery eyes and a scratchy throat; then this proposal is based on hysterical thinking. Speculation that isn't backed by numbers should not be the cause of regulations. And how does that number of affected passengers compare to the number of other passengers that had no problems?  Is this a problem on every plane?

While my son has a peanut allergy...he has a more ""severe"" dairy allergy which causes him to break out in hives by touching something that someone else may have touched after eating a piece of cheese, yogurt, etc.. He is also anaphlaxis to dairy. 
The last time I flew (SWA) I requested a peanut free flight and preboarded to wipe down the chair/wall/armrest/window/tray...not only because of peanuts...but also because of milk protein residue. 

The point I'm making is I think it doesn't make sense to deny passengers peanuts on planes when there are several  people/children who have ""other"" allergies that are just as severe. 

As a parent to a severely allergic child...what I'd like to see is the following: 
1) Strict training/education for pilots & flight attendants on food allergies and what to do in the event of a reaction. As well, how to remain ""curteous"" and ""caring"" when dealing with food allergic passengers. 
2) Only restrict peanuts on flights where a passenger has submitted a disability request for a peanut free flight. 
3) Allow parent/passenger to preboard to wipe down area. 
4) For patients who are ""airborne"" allergic...have them take the 1st flight of the day. 1st flights with a designated ""airborne"" allergic passenger would have an ""extra"" VIP cleaning. 
5) Require flight attendant to announce that it is a peanut free flight and anything with peanuts as an ingredient should not be opened.",,,,,,,

My daughter was diagnosed at 13 months of age and she is now 8 years old.  Every trip we have taken we have driven instead of flying because of the peanuts that would be on the plane. Exposure, accidental exposure or cross contamination is something that we fear every single day.  I take every measure possible to ensure 'most likely' that this does not happen.  We drive to our destinations, I bake all goodies for her classroom, we can only eat out at restaurants that don't use peanuts or peanut oil on their menu, we read labels diligently, ect.  
Most all people do not understand about the severity of peanut allergies and think we are asking the airlines to make a huge concession and refer to our children as ""why don't you just put them in a bubble""  or ""driving is dangerous too, why not ban driving"", and hundreds more comments like that.  They do not understand that you only have seconds to inject with Epinephrine and minutes to get to an ER for treatment.
Just having a peanut free 'zone' on a plane is not good enough, as the air is recirculated and if peanut dust gets into the lungs that will surely cause a fatal reaction.
I hope and pray that you will decide to pass this law so that we can start flying as a family and so my daughter can fly as an adult.

There are other conditions and products served on flights, moreover, that cause severe allergic reactions but are not addressed by this proposed rule.  Peanut allergies do not deserve special treatment, especially in light of the evidence on the immediate health threat.  And attempting to regualte all allergic conditions would be too unwieldy.  Moreover some of the proposals to bar peanuts would impact other passengers, the vast  majority of which are non allergic to peanuts.  For example, passengers may be banned from eating their own snacks, such as the ubiquitous peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  I enjoy eating peanuts and related snacks and passenegers should be permitted to do so. 
   Balanced against the lack of data that suggests no immediate health hazards, the costs of this proposed regulation are potentially immense.  Some proposals suggest that airlines have some flights that are peanut or nut free.  The high administrative cost of such a rule to the airlines would be simply be factored into tickets, which would raise prices for everyone.   In the 1990s, Congress demanded that federal agencies not regulate in this area, which is still the appropriate response.  
   The issue shoudl be handled by airlines under existing law.  If a passenger makes an advance request that he or she be provided a peanut free environment, the airline probably has a legal requirement to accomodate reasonably that passenger under teh ADA and create a limited peanut free zone, which means segreagting that passenger in a row from peanut products.  Congress has already adequately addreessed the issue and that resolution balances appropriately the concerns of an allergic passenger with the greater concerns of the flying public.",,,,,,,

My 4 year old was diagnosed with a life threatening allergy to peanuts at the age of 2.5yrs. We have flown with her many times since then and it has always been stessfull. I have always called the airline a few days before the flight to inform them of the allergy situation, they always promise to make sure no peanuts are served in flight. Even with this promis I have come across flights where peanuts are served and the in flight meal has peanut products or contaminated food. I do bring sanitization wipes for the seats and bathrooms. Luckelly my daughters allergy is not airborn or we would NEVER take her on a plane due to other passengers bringing peanuts aboard. The ventalated air would be to much of a risk. I also do not allow her, or any passengers next to us to have a pillow or blanket due to possible contamination from previouse passengers. My daughter is four as I stated above so she often touches things and puts her fingers in her mouth before washing, no matter how vigilant I am.
These are precautions I take and will always. Taking peanut products off the planes would greatlly reduce my stress over flying. The fear of havng to inject my daughter with her epi pen is real and would not make for a relaxing flight for anyone. Most people do not take a peanut allegry seriously, so thank you.

We flew on Northwest Airlines before Delta merged.  We took the first flight in the morning, flew direct, and the passengers were not served peanuts.  It was a flight without incident.  Why? because Northwest airlines did not serve peanuts on his flight.  

My son has a life threatening peanut allergy.  His IgE is a Class 6 (out of 6) and his level is <100.  He has been to the emergency room for anaphylaxis several times.  All have been from accidental contact exposure to peanuts.

No, I am not a ""helicopter parent"", my son plays in dirt, he loves baseball, goes to school, has play dates, and does all the things a 9 year old does... except any exposure to peanuts could end his life.  He carries medication with him where ever he goes.  This is a day-in, day-out condition we manage to live with.

My son has been deemed eligible under the ADA for a 504 in school due to his severe life threatening allergies to peanuts.  He receives accommodations that reduce the risk.  He has a disability under the law.

It is my understanding that airlines have previously made determinations for persons with a disability to receive necessary accommodations to fly safely.  My son's condition qualifies as a disability.

He should be able to get into an airplane to fly to visit family without having to worry that he will have an anaphylactic reaction 30,000 feet up.  If 200+ other people were eating peanuts on such a flight, there is no doubt in my mind a reaction would quickly follow.  We would have our medication with us, but that only buys time to get to a hospital for treatment.

Please consider removing peanuts from all flights with a passenger with a peanut allergy.  It is a deadly allergy and until a cure is found, the only treatment is strict avoidance.  For our family that means very limited selection in flights or no flights at all.

Despite his wearing a ticket around his neck that had ""severe peanut allergy"" highlighted, and being assured by every reservation CSR, gate manager and flight attendant that there would be no peanuts served, peanuts were served. My son did not eat any but just breathing the particles in the recirclated air caused him to have an allergic reaction. His eyes were swollen shut when he got off the plane and his lips were swollen as well. Despite having a flight manifiest from Skychef showing that peanuts were boarded for the flight, and passengers who were willing to testify as witnesses, American never admitted to serving peanuts on that flight and in fact suggested my son was exaggerating for the attention.  We settled with American out of court after they put us through hours and hours of deposition.

I love peanuts as much as the next person, but really people, look at the statistics, and ask yourself if you'd be willing to have the passenger in the seat next to you die just so you could enjoy your snack.  An airplane just isn't the place to test this proposition.

ADA and ACAA should protect people with severe allergies that could be aggravated in flight. Yes, it's a slippery slope, but that 's what we pay our members of Congress and regulators for.

People with a severe peanut allergy take a risks on a daily basis but minimize that risk by carrying medications and having access to emergency services.

My now 16 year old son had a reaction to peanuts being served when he was 3 years old.  He was asleep when we boarded and still asleep when the crew handed out bags of peanuts to passengers on the fully booked plane.  There was no chance that he actually ate anything.  He started coughing, scratching and wheezing.  He was covered in hives, and had difficulty breathing - just from breathing peanut protein in the air.

When I reported this to US Air, I received an apology for our ""uncomfortable flight"", which demonstrated a complete lack of understanding of the problem.

Peanuts pose a risk to those who are allergic when the peanut protein is released into the air upon opening vacuum sealed bags.  There is no escape at 30,000 feet, and no long-lasting emergency treatment either.  Treatment involves administration of epinephrine, and prompt transfer to an Emergency Department - also impossible while in flight.

Other snacks can certainly be substituted for the duration of the flight.  Passengers can happily resume eating peanuts or peanut products once they have disembarked.

This experience has sharply limited our travels.  We will only fly airlines that don't serve peanuts, which limits our choice of destinations.  We have passed on trips that would involve unsafe travel for our son.

I realize airlines have no control over what passengers bring on board with them.  I don't think the same hazard exists from a few isolated people eating peanut products, as there is when virtually the whole plane eats them.  We understand that.

Please support a ban on the service of peanuts in flight.

Thank you.",,,,,,,

It's obviously hard for those who've never lived with this or had a loved one who lives with this, to empathize.  Perhaps that's because this is an ""allergy"" which people tend to associate with a runny nose.  

But if our son touches a handrest with peanut oil on it, then rubs his eyes, he is likely to go into anaphylatic shock, in which case his throat begins to swell up, and in the worst case, eventually closes, causing suffication.  Only Benadryll, EpiPens, and a trip to the hospital can save his life at that point.

We are careful.  We avoid going to baseball games where peanuts are often everywhere.  We can check ingredient labels.  But in today's world, one thing we cannot avoid, is flying.

Peanuts are not like milk, eggs, wheat or any other food-based allergy:  To avoid a reaction, one simply DOES NOT EAT those things on a plane.  But peanut reactions can be caused by trace amounts of peanut dust or oil, both of which are invisible to the naked eye, and almost impossible to avoid on a flight where peanuts are being consumed. 

Once my son was on a plane, before we knew about his allergy.  His eyes swelled shut and unbeknownst to us at the time, his throat was probably closing too.  Thankfully, he never got to the life threatening stage on that flight (he maintained his breathing).  His reaction was caused by something out of his control:  He did not ingest peanuts.  He either breathed in some peanut dust, or came into contact with peanut oil from a seat, handrest or similar surface on the plane (we never knew for sure).

We are not asking people to pay more for their flights, or to avoid food or beverages on a flight.  We're asking that they not eat peanuts for a few hours.  It seems a resonable request in order to avoid loss of life.  

Are there really people out there who believe their right to eat peanuts on an enclosed flight trumps our son's right to stay alive?",,,,,,,

I am a registered nurse of twenty years with a son who is severely allergic to peanuts. We are in support of this proposed regulation in that we have found the airline industry to be cavalier, dismissive and for the most part, unhelpful in managing his allergies when we are on board a flight. In my opinion, this is an accident waiting to happen. We intentionally avoid airlines and flights w/peanuts and nuts whenever possible. I have noticed in the two years that while peanuts for a period of time were not being served on planes, they are once again being distributed. Flight staff lacks understanding and know how about what to do in case of a reaction and they are annoyed when we asked if they can institute a peanut free zone. 

Ironically, I flew this past April from a food allergy conference on Delta Airlines. Fortunately, my son was not with me. Delta proceeded to provide an in flight snack of TWO bags of peanuts to every passenger. When asked if they had an alternative snack, they replied they only had peanuts and nothing else.

It is mind boggling to me that the airline served this snack in the first place. It is abundantly clear that they are in need of a serious wake up call. If my son had been on that flight it would have been a nightmare. There was so much peanut dust in the air, you could cut it with a knife and it was all over people's trays, you couldn't miss it.

Something must be done about the airliines treatment of peanut allergic individuals as it is surely an accident waiting to happen. Please adopt these rules before someone, especially an unsuspecting child, dies. 

Thank you for your time.

Peanuts are potentially fatal to my son.  An epi-pen lasts 15-20 minutes at best, and thus we travel with multiples at all times.  Certainly our travel is restricted.

There are many food items which do not cause potentially fatal reactions which could be served instead of peanuts.  Indeed, I do not expect airlines to serve my son at all, but I do hope a time comes when he can travel without fear of what is being served to those around him.

Cigarettes were banned for the health of all.  Peanuts could be banned - which could save some, allow more equal access to travel for even more and is something everyone can do without.

Even if a passenger a few rows back is eating nuts, s/he may leave nut oils on other seat backs, in the bathroom, etc., (from the current or previous flight). This can be extremely dangerous to a person with nut allergies. Many can have an anaphylactic reaction and thus stop breathing, without having even ingested the nut itself. Even with their epi pens they may not survive without appropriate medical treatment. Obviously this is not available on airlines. Please take into account this ever growing population and the life and death nature of these allergies. I'm happy to provide more information if needed.

I have 2 children who are both allergic to tree nuts and we fly several times a year.  I have to worry when we get on a plane if they will be serving some kind of tree nuts.  If so, then I have to worry if a person who has eaten those nuts will touch something my child will touch? Will he have a reaction? Will I have to administer the epi-pen? Would we be able to land quick enough to make to a hospital?  That is not the kind of stress a person should have to have traveling on any airline.  I believe airlines should allow passengers to submit a request to have the flight be peanut/nut free.  This way the airline could be notified ahead of time and chose a different snack, ie pretzels.  A person shouldn't have to worry about living or dying based on the airline serving peanuts or tree nuts on the flight. This seems like a simple solution. Thank you.",,,,,,,

My daughter, Madeline Marks had an anaphylactic allergic reaction by licking a peanut in August of 2008 on a commuter flight operated by Continental Airlines.  She was 2 1/2 years old.

There was no epi pen on board.  No benadryl.  And the stewardess had no idea what to do.  Luckily we were on a relatively short flight and an ambulance met us immediately when we landed.  If we had been stuck in flight for a minute, literally one minute more, i fear our story could have ended much differently.

A year later while on a Southwest Airlines flight, she had an allergic reaction to the peanut dust that was on her seat when the back of her legs touched the chair.

Peanuts and tree nuts should not be served on airlines.  When you are at 35,000 feet you have very few options.  These horror stories are preventable.  There are plenty of other safe options and while I realize airlines cannot guaruntee a 100% peanut/tree nut free plane due to other passengers, many steps can be taken immediately that would drastically reduce the chances of a reaction taking place.

Now that I know about my daughters condition, I am prepared.  But every day it is scary to let her go out into the world. We had no idea she was allergic to peanuts that day on the plane, e older brother ate peanut butter sandwiches everyday.  And thank goodness we had the ability to land quickly, I worry about the other families who are not so lucky.  This is- should be- an easy decision.  I would be happy to provide more information or share more ideas if it would be helpful.

Thank you again for this opportunity and for looking into this important issue.

Being a parent of a 1 year old with a severe allergy to peanuts, it's definately a huge concern that they would allow something so life threatening to be up in the air where there's no hospital or medical professional on hand. 
This is a #1 allergen!! It KILLS many adults and children day to day. 

Even with wiping down and sanitizing seats and surfaces, the people with this allergy can still react and die. 
If you could do something to prevent someone dying, why wouldn't you on a plane? 

Next time you fly, look at a child or person beside you. They could die if you eat peanuts. You may say I'm over reacting. I never understood the severety until my son reacted. Life and death become very real then. 

Think twice before you eat anything peanut in public, or especially on a plane. Would you really want to be the reason of a near death, or death experience?",,,,,,,

I also call the day before the flight to remind them and tell the ticket agent when we check in and the flight attendant.  Whenever flying Delta though no amount of advanced preparations have ever allowed this accomodation to be made.  Unfortunately, Delta ia a major carrier and at times I must fly with them.  I have avoided air travel for 3 years because of my last negative experience with peanuts being served all around us once the flight took off (after being reassured that no peanuts would be served for three rows in front of and behind us).  The right to breathe freely seems to outweigh the right to eat peanuts on an airplane.  The issue is not eating peanuts, but rather the large quantity of peanuts being eaten and packages being opened at one time.  There is no where to go to get away from the allergen because you are in the air.  Any other time I am in this situation I just remove my child from the area (e.g. I have had to leave a ball park because people were cracking open peanut shells and eating them around us and my daughter had a pretty serious reaction. )  On the plane you can't leave.",,,,,,,

(1) Peanut dust in the mechanical air circulation equipment of the plane.  This could be remediated by cleaning the equipment and air ducts, and ceasing to serve peanuts and peanut products on the plane. (2) Snacks as a source of peanuts and peanut dust.  This can be remediated by not seving these products on the plane, on any flight.  As a family with two peanut allergic children, we have been very successful with asking the flight crew to substitute non-peanut snacks on our flight, but this is a risky policy because there may be no other choices available. Southwest Airlines asks us to register the allergy at the time of purchasing the ticket, which enables them to plan the snacks in advance. (3) Other passengers who bring peanuts or peanut products on the plane for consumption during the flight.  This is a very sticky situation.  The last time this happened, we asked the stewardess to please ask the passenger to refrain from eating the peanut-based snack, but she had already eaten it and did not have more with her. Fortunately, there were no consequences for our children since the passenger was very neat and did not drop the peanut dust all over the seat, as some do.  The most effective way to protect people with peanut allergy on planes is to clean the planes, stop serving peanut-based snacks and prohibit passengers from bringing peanut based snacks on the planes.  Stores at the airport should be encouraged not to sell peanut based snacks so that passengers do not have easy access to them.  Airlines could advertise ""peanut-free flights.""  We know of a family that did not fly until their son was about 18 years old for fear of peanut dust in the airplane.  Banning peanuts in planes would be good for these people who have to live their lives under extreme constraints, and would be good for business by making travel available to them. Thank you.",,,,,,,

For ease, I think it needs to include any food item that contains peanuts or peanut products (e.g., peanut butter crackers, products containing peanut oil, etc.). 

The current practice of not prescribing carrier practices does not protect those with severe airborn peanut allergies.
Unfortunately, any other option does not protect last minute flight changes that are not the result of the passenger. 

When peanuts /peanut products are brought on board aircraft by passengers, airline staff can cite laws that require they confiscate the food until the flight has landed. Ideally, they would be given something in lieu of the snack by the airline as well as a fact card on the dangers of peanut allergies.

I have a strong view because my 6 year old son is severely allergic to peanuts, even when airborn. While he has not suffered a reaction on a plane he has reacted to peanuts when in the same room. 

I do think it is the responsibility of the passenger to carry an epi-pen. That said, having one available in the first aid kit would be prudent as a back-up plan with no legal liability attached.

I would be happy to discuss.",,,,,,,

Walk through a Delta plane sometime and you'll notice peanuts are everywhere. On floors, seats, handrails. This is even after the planes were supposedly cleaned between flights. 

If we had a family emergency and the only flight we could choose was Delta, we wouldn't attend the family emergency. Flying Delta would be too much of a risk. 

I realize we can't live in a bubble and control what people eat. There are peanuts in the world. In fact, even if passengers brought a snack containing peanut, this would be far less of a risk than airlines pushing peanuts on passengers in an attempt to ""support the peanut farmers"" in the state where Delta is headquartered: Georgia. 

If Delta really wants to support the Georgia peanut farmers, they would help further and mainstream the cure for peanut allergies (based on promising research being conducted by Duke U, etc). 

With a peanut allergy cure, serving peanuts on flights could potentially become a non issue. But for now, we're fortunate to have choices. Just like I can't control what people eat, I can't control what airlines serve. What I can do is choose to fly airlines that don't serve peanuts, like Sun Country. 

However, if the Department of Transportation could enhance airline passenger protections by disallowing airlines to serve items that contain peanuts or that are made on equipment or in a facility that processes peanuts, we'd greatly appreciate it.",,,,,,,

As the parent of a ten-year old child extremely allergic to peanuts, I wholeheartedly support the banning of peanuts on airplanes.   My son has had allergic reactions from coming into contact with peanut residue in public places.  Airplanes can and often do serve pretzels or other small snacks.  Given the increasing incidence of peanut allergies, banning them on airplanes can help to reduce a known public health risk.  While other airline customers could still bring these or other allergy-causing food items on planes, the allergen concentration wouldn't be as high as when the airplanes serves peanuts to all customers.

Thank you for considering these comments.  I write them as a concerned mother and have not been influenced by any special interest group or grassroots request.

Peanut buffer zones are insufficient.  Prior passengers may have dropped peanuts on the ground, wiped their hands on seats, armrests, or tables, or, worst-case scenario, coughed out a piece of partially chewed peanut, which could easily send a sufferer of even moderate allergies into anaphylactic shock.  Requiring advanced notice would be ineffective for the same reasons and could subject travelers to unforeseen dangers when, for example, there are delays or other circumstances that force such travelers to board an alternative flight.  

As a parent of a 2.5 year old toddler who has already twice had an anaphylactic reaction to small amounts of peanuts, I know just how quickly such situations can become life-threatening and how difficult it is to care for someone outside of the emergency room.  First, your child begins to have itchy red bumps around his mouth, which quickly spread across his entire body.  Then his eyes swell shut and he begins to cough.  After you have administered liquid antihistamines, he vomits up everything, including his medicine, over and over again.  Finally, his breathing becomes labored and his blood pressure drops and the only thing that brings him back is either an i.v. of multiple histamine blockers and steroids or an epipen.  There is no time to land a plane in such situations--and epipens can be dangerous and are, at best, only temporarily effective.  I can see no reason why a child should have to face death or permanent disability whenever he travels to visit his grandparents simply so someone can snack on peanuts 30,000 feet above the earth.  Perfectly acceptable, tasty and nutritious alternatives exist, and it would pose no inconvenience to the carriers to stock such substitutes instead of dangerous allergens.",,,,,,,

People with peanut allergies can DIE IN FLIGHT if someone on the plane opens a package of peanuts and the allergic person goes into Anaphylactic Shock.

It would seem like the neatest way to handle this problem would be to ban all peanuts and products.  Serve pretzels instead. A workable but less optimal option would be banning the serving of peanuts and all products containing peanuts on flights where a passenger has requested a peanut-free flight in advance.  However, it leaves room for error - the request may not be inputted correctly during the reservation process.  It also puts the onus on the crew to make sure the plane has been sufficiently cleaned if its previous leg was not a peanut free leg.  I do not think a buffer zone is a viable solution.  It is not preferable to maintain the current practice of not prescribing carrier practices.  The inconsistency creates confusion; I have never known inconsistency to be a worthwhile characteristic of any action plan.  
Handling peanut products brought on board by passengers can be tricky for airlines.  Please know that the peanut allergic community realizes this, and there is no clear answer.  Some options would be (1) requiring any passenger who would like other passengers to be prohibited from bringing peanuts onto the plane to request that an announcement be made at the gate, so passengers have time to procure different snacks, (2) prohibit the most obvious peanut products – peanuts and peanut butter - but allow everything else (3) empower flight crews to confiscate other passengers' peanut products if a peanut allergic passenger identifies them as a threat.  I could live with a peanut butter sandwich 6 rows in front of my daughter, but not next to her.  Carrying epinephrine should be up to the passenger, but crew should be trained to administer.  The ban should be on all products containing peanuts, and all carrier-served products should clearly be labeled to state whether they were made on shared eqip. with peanuts or in a facility that prcoesses peanuts.",,,,,,,

As the mother of a child with severe peanut and tree nut allergies, and as a pediatric nurse practitioner, I am very excited to see this dialogue taking place. While it is nigh to impossible to convince schools to ban peanuts or nuts - as well as somewhat unrealistic, with schools being a microcosm of the real world - it would be wonderful to not have the concerns of taking a flight 30,000 feet or so above medical care and worrying about the ""what if"" of nut exposure. 

Please remember that many children and adults who are allergic to the proteins in peanuts are also allergic to the proteins in various tree nuts. While peanut allergies are by far the most common, sensitivity to other nuts remains a concern to people and severity of reactions will vary amongst individuals.

On a personal note, my son's actual manifestation of his previously-undiagnosed peanut allergy came at an MLB game, where he was trying to get into the spirit of the baseball game by helping another child shell peanuts. My son had never eaten peanuts or peanut butter, as even the touch of such to his tongue caused him to ""reject"" the product - we had always ascribed it to his just not liking the flavor. At the baseball game, his body became covered in hives, fortunately only on the outside of his body. Perhaps being in the breezy outdoors had prevented the peanut dust from being inhaled into his respiratory system and causing potential airway involvement and blockage. Regardless, being at a baseball game in a major city, he was minutes away from medical care. We have since confirmed his severe peanut allergy, as well as his allergy to tree nuts.

On a professional level, I worry about the many people who are “trapped” in the enclosed spaces of aircraft with potential exposure to life-threatening allergens, and have available for medical assistance only what Providence has provided in the way of fellow passengers with medical expertise. The treatment for anaphylaxis – an extreme allergic reaction involving closing of the airway – is minimally provided by injection of one or more epinephrine doses (most commonly via Epi-Pen or Twinject injection devices), followed by immediate treatment by a professional medical team. On the ground, this would involve the injection of the epinephrine followed by immediate calling of 911 and transport to a hospital for observation or admission. Recurrence of the allergic reaction can occur anytime up to over 24 hours after the initial exposure, so just treating with the epinephrine dose(s) is not the end of the treatment. If the epinephrine dose(s) fail – and here I question if such medication is carried on-board by the airlines, in the event that travelers do not carry such medication, or if their medication administration device fails or is not administered correctly  - then the next step would involve an emergency tracheotomy to open the airway. This involves cutting a hole in the front of the neck and inserting a tube to the lungs, to bypass the closed upper airway. On a lucky day, perhaps there might be on-board an otolaryngologist (ear/nose/throat physician) with experience in performing tracheotomies, even though adequate equipment might be unavailable. On a somewhat unlucky day, one might find someone such as me, who has read literature on performing emergency tracheotomies but who certainly doesn’t want to be performing one on anyone, including my own son (which would likely be impossible for a mother to do). On a really unlucky day, a passenger might have to be watched while panicky staff and fellow travelers stand by as the passenger agonizingly suffocates to death, with the plane searching for a landing site.

Handing out bags of peanuts to travelers on a plane is, for an allergic person, similar to having someone hand out hand grenades to fellow travelers (though it is done legally by the airlines). All it takes is one misstep or thoughtless act, and the weapon is deployed. I cannot personally even imagine the fear that my son and others must go through to know that something which could kill you is being handled in a carefree way as easily as if it were, well, a harmless food item. So many people think that a food allergy only causes problems if it is actually ingested by the affected person, or that it might make them perhaps sneeze lightly. If only that were so . . . .

Similarly, allowing other passengers to handle nut products which they have brought on-board can be just as severe a problem. The oils on their hands (which cannot be “de-activated” by alcohol-based waterless hand cleaners, only by generous amounts of soap and water) can allow the nut protein which is responsible for the allergic reaction to remain on surfaces long beyond their consumption of the product. This would include restroom door handles. I can see a conscientious mother telling her child, who has just consumed his peanut butter candy product, that there may be others who have peanut allergies and instructing him to go to the restroom to wash his hands – and there on the door handles, the oil would remain. And for those travelers who are not conscientious, then obviously the potential spread of the allergen is even worse. 

A nut-free flight when requested by an allergic passenger would have to involve the cleansing of the interior of the aircraft with vacuum as well as soap and water between flights. Having some flights being nut-free and others being “nut-allowed” would confuse the consumer and severely decrease compliance of nut products not being brought on-board by passengers.

Thus, peanut-free zones are a nice idea, but would in reality have to include the entire airliner, and have to include not only airline-provided nut products, but passenger-provided products as well. Obviously, there is likely never to be a search for contraband nut products in luggage on the scale in which it is done for a weapon – but for nut-allergic passengers, it is every bit as lethal a threat.

To specifically answer the questions posited by the proposed regulation . . . 

At checkpoints, passengers should be handed well-marked zipper-closure bags (brightly colored and labeled) into which they should place any products containing nuts/peanuts. This would include the obviously marked “peanut” or “nut” products, as well as a pre-defined list of other products such as granola bars which may include nuts as one of the main ingredients. Possible inclusion (to be determined by an expert) would also be snack/potato chips which are fried in peanut oil. Not needing inclusion in this bag would be products such as cookies or crackers labeled as “made in a facility which also produces peanuts/tree nuts” – while allergic passengers will tend to avoid ingestion of these products, there is likely not enough of the allergen present in these products to provide significant incidental exposure to provoke an allergic reaction via contact only. This pre-defined list of products should be prepared for the airliners by a medical expert, and for ease of use should not be a lengthy list, but include general categories of food items. After placing their products in this bag, passengers could carry these bags with them on the flight but would be prohibited from opening them during the flight. 

How likely is it that an allergic passenger will sustain a reaction due to contact exposure as opposed to oral ingestion? Read my personal story above, and remember that we were among the lucky ones. Another passenger, in an enclosed space, might not be so lucky.

Epinephrine pens – one pen is often not adequate for an anaphylactic reaction, which is why many patient carry two/dual pens. And sometimes two pens is not even enough, which is why there needs to be access to continued medical care, which is difficult to provide on an airliner, particularly on overseas flights. What about the people, such as our family, who did not even know of a peanut allergy until the “big” exposure – and who don’t carry an epinephrine pen? There are a number of medical emergencies where epinephrine is needed, and being far from a medical facility, the airliners really need to carry this on-board. 

I do not have any anecdotal evidence of in-flight allergic problems. My son and I fly rarely, and when we do, we search for a carrier who does not provide peanut products and practice aggressive avoidance of any potential exposures – then we hope and pray for a safe and quick stay aboard the airliner.

Thank you for your attention to this issue and to my comments.",,,,,,,

Last year, at age 2, he had his first anaphylactic episode.   It was terrifying to see my baby in this situation so obviously we want to do whatever we can to keep him safe. 
Ultimately, we know that it is our responsibility.  I always carry safe snacks for him. I never requested that his classroom be a peanut free  zone. I wipe down surfaces in public places. We work hard to teach him to take care of himself, rather than depending on others.  
Having said all that, we fully support the ban on peanuts because despite our best efforts, this is one area that we can not control.  There is nothing that we can do to protect the air that he breathes.  We have no desire to infringe on any one's rights, we just want to keep our son alive. 
I know opponents often say that we just shouldn't fly but I think they are overlooking the bigger issue of the toll allergies take on a family.  So my other son should never go on a plane bc some stranger is so selfish they can't give up a bag of peanuts for a few hours?  Better yet, let him go on vacation while Mommy and brother stay home? My father in law lives in the Netherlands.  His health prevents him from traveling.  He has never met his youngest grandson.  I refuse to fly Internationally until a ban is in place.  Considering I have traveled all over the world, it breaks my heart to think of my youngest son never having the joy of running with the bulls in Pomplona, swimming the beautiful water in Mauritius or just meeting his Grandfather. 
It seems hard to believe at one point there were smoking sections on planes.  Obviously if the poor ventilation didn't work for creating a smoke free area, how can we expect it to make it safe for a highly allergic passenger? When this law was passed, not  everyone embraced this decision but it was the right thing to do.  Let's hope it happens again.",,,,,,,

In October of 2008 we were in the process of moving to Canada and were on a return flight from Seattle to Anchorage. Our then 16 month son and our nearly 4 year old son were both traveling with us on our return flight. Our oldest son had a peanut cereal bar, our youngest son took a bite ( we did not yet know he was allergic), within minutes our 16 month old son's face began to swell, his eyes teared as if crying hard, his nose began to run as if he had caught an immediate cold. His lips swelled to a surprising level. As parents we didn't yet know about peanut allergies, and we were concerned with what was happening. Because the cereal bar had been provided by us to our oldest son we were confused and scared what we had done to our youngest. We were lucky. Our youngest son's reaction never went beyond that, his breathing never reached the point of labored or worse. Upon landing in Anchorage we consulted with our Pediatrician and within days had a full scale allergy test: the worst was confirmed. Our youngest son, our baby, had a severe peanut allergy. We were told to prepare for the possibility his next encounter would be anaphylactic. Since October 2008 we have never been without an epi-pen. On one recent plane flight (we travel often by plane) we were seated in a ""peanut zone"" (NWA/Delta flight) where supposedly there were to be no peanuts. My husband happened to move the seat cushion a few inches and a full peanut was sitting right there, within reach of our youngest. I cannot tell you the horror that one feels when you are above 30,000 feet and you see this with a child that is so allergic. Our family doesn't ask for a peanut free earth, just a peanut free plane cabin. It seems the least we can do for those, like our son, who face the daily challenge of living in a world where one food,one single encounter with one food, can threaten their life. Please consider adopting this protection against peanuts in plane cabins. Thank you.",,,,,,,

I have read the reactions of other Americans via news websites and, in some ways, can understand the reactions that oppose this idea.  If we ban peanuts, are we going to ban egg products, then wheat, and where does it end?  I also agree that only a small portion of Americans suffer with peanut allergies and it seems strange to impose a rule that affects so many for the benefit of so few.   However, as the mother of one of ""the few"", this would mean a lot for our family.  

To address the opposition - one person eating peanuts in first class is not likely to affect even the most severely allergic coach passenger on a flight.  However, the dust from 100 bags of peanuts opening within a 5 minute period in a vehicle that recycles air offers up a different scenario.  Peanuts are unique (within the food allergies) because their dust makes them a difficult food to avoid on a plane simply by position or seclusion from other peanut consumers.

Anaphylaxis is a scary reality for those living with peanut allergies.  It is not just an uncomfortable reaction.  It is not just a rash or a shortness of breath.  Anaphylaxis is something that, if goes untreated during a one hour flight, could take someone's life.  It could take my three year old son's life.

Peanuts.  We are talking about peanuts.  We are not asking airlines to take away seat belts, or first class, or beverages.  We are asking them not to serve peanuts.  

I am appreciative of the of the Department of Transportation for even considering this topic.  I hope that you will thoughtfully review my comment when making your decision.  Until then, we will continue to fly the friendly skies with wet wipes, benadryl, epi pens and a prayer.",,,,,,,

My 8 year old has peanut allergy & carries epinephrine auto-injectors and Benadryl at all times. We have restricted air travel greatly due to her food allergies. We know many families with similar experiences. When flying we have found widely varied responses within and across airlines ranging from extremely helpful and accommodating to dismissive and hostile. We have been told one thing upon booking a ticket, only to be told contradictory things upon boarding. We have had helpful flight attendants, and condescending ones. Flight attendants have at times made announcements to the passengers and request that if they have brought peanut products not to eat them in-flight.  I myself have approached fellow-passengers eating peanut products (e.g., cookies, crackers) and requested that they not eat them in-flight. I typically find fellow-passengers to be kind and considerate. My child has had three reactions severe enough to warrant Emergency Room visits due to inhalation of airborne peanut particles, or contact with surfaces contaminated with peanut from other people’s usage. Ingestion is not necessary to cause a reaction. There should be an ban on products where peanut is an ingredient on airline flights at all times. This rule would be most parsimonious and easiest to enforce. It would not require specified changes on individual flights, and would significantly reduce the risk of contact reactivity, as cabins themselves contain less peanut residue. When a peanut allergic person is aboard, an pre-flight announcement should be made requesting that passengers not open/eat peanut products during the flight. I believe that peanut allergic persons or their parents should be responsible for bringing their own medication aboard, but that airline personnel should be trained to respond to anaphylaxis, similar to CPR, first aid or defibrilator training. Im glad the DOT is considering these important measures",,,,,,,

I really think that since this is so prevalent in both children and adults, that all snacks provided by an airline should meet these restrictions as many people who are allergic to peanuts are also allergic to tree nuts (they are not the same thing).  In addition, I feel since many people choose to carry on food, that the airline industry should stretch the ban to include anything people choose to carry on.

They are totally unecessary to anyone's ability to travel yet totally restrict a huge segment of the population from using airlines (ie. we cannot buy plane tickets..if that does not get your attention I don't know what else will).
Traveling by plane is terrifying, last attempt there was nut debris all over floor from previous flight and person in front munching on huge bag of mixed nuts yelling at  his companion seated next to my allergic 3 year old daughter to take some and who cares about the little girl..thought the air marshall would step in..it was a terrifying flight with us covering surfaces and her crying in a panic for 3 hours.  Flight crew was completely ambilivent to our requests for help, told us would not serve nuts, then immediately did so anyhow..had epipen in hand and gave kid benedryl as precautionary measure...it it beyond ridiculous to have what is a deadly poison to so many people sprinkle all over the interior of an airplane full of people and then send them into the air where they are cut off from and ER and just hope it all is okay...would you let your child play in a sandbox filled of arsenic powder?  This is what putting my kid in an airplane is exactly like.  Please use basic common sense and BAN all nuts from the planes.  Thank you",,,,,,,

I ask the decision makers and the those against making the necessary changes to ask themselves how their life would be impacted if they or a one of their children was diagnosed with life threatening peanut allergies? Is there really a choice? This is less about the peanut and more about doing what is right regardless if it was peanut or a grape. 

There is a huge inconsistency within the arilines. From the baggage handlers, to the gate checkin, to the flight attendents. A customer should know what they are expected to do when traveling w/ life threatening food allergies and so should every staff member. Protocols should be published and adhered to.

I support the ban for two reasons;

1)	The health and welfare of travels with peanut allergies.  The cabin of an airliner is an extremely small space with the air in the passenger re-circulating throughout the flight.  The introduction of peanuts into this closed environment unnecessarily exposes travelers who are allergic to peanuts to the possibility of suffering a potentially life threatening reaction, at altitude, and without the benefit of quick access to emergency medical treatment.

2)	Convenience and safety of all passengers, even those who are not allergic to peanuts.  I know first hand that if a passenger becomes seriously ill during a flight, the flight crew is required to divert and land at the nearest suitable airport so that the passenger can receive medical treatment.  This ‘non-standard’, possibly emergency, descent and landing not only inconveniences fellow travels but exposes them to a flight segment that, while not necessarily unsafe, is unscheduled and therefore has a lower margin of safety than the schedule flight to their intended destination.

While I sympathize with peanut growers who face economic losses if peanuts are removed from commercial airlines, the safety of the traveling public (both allergic and non-allergic alike) should take precedents over the limited economic impact of this proposal.  Simply removing peanuts from commercial airline flights is a small price to pay to enhance safety.",,,,,,,

My son is 5 years old and has a severe peanut allergy. At the age of 18 months we gave him his first taste of peanut butter, only to have him go into anaphylaxis shock. 

Since then he has flown twice. Both times I contacted the airline ahead of time and explained that he had a peanut allergy and was assured that no peanuts were going to be served. The first time we flew, both our flights served pretzels and was told that was what was served in the previous fight so we had a nice relaxing flight. The second time we flew, the airline served trail mix, which we know usually has traces of peanuts in it. My husband, myself and I did not get the snack but everyone around us did. At one point during the flight I noticed his skin become red in spots and he began to break out in a rash. I am not sure if this was due to the peanut protein in the air or any peanut residue left on seat from a previous flight.  We were thankful that it was only a rash and the he did not get any peanut residue on his fingers and in his mouth, because if he had he would have went into shock. 

We decided at that point that if we could get anywhere by driving than we'd drive over flying. We know we can keep him safe in the car as opposed to in a plane. If DOT does decide to ban peanuts than we'd be open to flying again.  Thanks again for your consideration.",,,,,,,

Currently, flying with a severe peanut allergy is a risky enterprise. In addition, tree nuts should not be allowed on flights since most people with life-threatening peanut allergies must also avoid tree nuts. Studies have shown that tree nut allergies have kept pace with the increase in peanut allergies and they are just as deadly and easy to spread around an airplane cabin.

To me, this matter is easy to resolve with a peanut and tree nut ban on flights. It is not feasible to support those that claim an infringemen of their ""rights"" by being denied peanuts or tree nuts in flight. Many substances are limited or restricted during a flight (cigarettes, aerosols, carry on liquids bigger than 1 oz.) and it is my belief that a total peanut and tree nut ban makes the most sense. Buffer zones have not been proven effective and are very often not policed; ""peanut-free"" flights become ineffective when the previous flight was not peanut-free. We experienced this on American Airlines--our flight didn't hand out peanuts as a snack but the floor of the cabin was covered in peanut shells. The shells present enough allergen to cause someone to react 30,000 feet in the air. The current policies pay lip service to protecting the severely allergic but they don't really work.

As the mother of a child with a severe and life-threatening allergy to peanuts and tree nuts (she has had a life-threatening initial reaction and mere contact reactions since) my family of four, though we have the means, generally will avoid situations that involve flying. So not only are we being denied a safe means of public conveyance, but the airline industry isn't just losing one paying passenger, but four.

Please consider the health and life of a growing population of allergy sufferers who have the right to safe public conveyance via the airlines and institute a peanut ban.",,,,,,,

This is not just a matter of preventing a runny nose, upset stomach, itching, etc.  It is a matter of preventing anaphylaxis.
I have a 4 year old son with this allergy.  I would love to be able to fly home from Boston to MI at Christmas to be at a family wedding.  But currently, I am not comfortable flying with the lack of policies that are out there.  We will be driving and at the mercy of the weather over a longer period of time.

Dear Mr. Mosley:

We are writing to support your proposed rule to ban the serving of peanuts and all peanut products.  We understand that there has been some backlash against this proposed rule, but we believe those opposed do not realize that peanut allergies are significantly different than other food allergies.  Our daughter could go into anaphylactic shock if she comes in contact with peanuts or peanut products, where contact means touch, inhalation, or ingestion.  Therefore, this is different from something like an allergy to seafood where allergic individual is only at risk if he or she ingests seafood. 

Because of the severity of this allergy, our first choice would be to ban the serving of peanuts and all peanut products by both U.S. and foreign carriers on flights covered by DOT’s disability rule; but if this is infeasible, then we think the second option (i.e., Banning the serving of peanuts and all peanut products on all such flights where a passenger with a peanut allergy is on board and has requested a peanut-free flight in advance) would improve the safety of travelers with severe peanut allergies.  

The third option, however, would provide very little additional safety for those with severe peanut allergies because this option would fail to limit peanut and peanut products on the flight and thus only minimally reduce the risk of the person with a peanut allergy not coming in contact with the products that could be life threatening to them.  

For the airlines who object to this proposed rule, please let them know that they are currently losing our business.  For example, we no longer fly Southwest.  For trips between Hawaii and the mainland, we try to fly Hawaiian Airlines whenever possible because of their no peanut policy.

Thank you very much for listening to our concern.

Sincerely,
Paul and Rachel Bernstein",,,,,,,

These allergies are now  so severe that she  avoids traveling by airplane.  Even with her arsenal of Epipens, she feels it is just too dangerous for her , and we agree.

I believe that the  prohibition  should extend to peanuts and tree nuts, since the latter are also major allergens,and should also include the banning of passengers bringing these products on board. If one is allergic to peanuts and nuts, who serves/has them is irrelevant. For people this allergic, these products are deadly, and are strong poisons .


Airlines serving these products is only part of the problem, since passengers routinely bring and consume their own food on airplanes. A buffer zone is better than nothing, but passengers move around, use the washroom and transfer the peanut/nut protein to door handles, taps etc. Even if there is a temporary buffer zone, that does not protect the allergic individual against what the previous passenger touched. Peanut/  nut protein is hard to remove, and is invisible, and previous passengers  may have contaminated the tray tops.

Peanut/nut allergic individuals can try to avoid allergens by consuming their own food, but they do need to use the washrooms.  And a study a few years ago found peanut proteins in the air filters.

The person who is allergic is expected to carry her own Epipens, but in the case of a really bad reaction, Epipens only provide 20-30 miinutes relief.  People who are very allergic are going to bring and eat their own food--that is not the issue.  The issue is that cross contamination can come from anywhere.",,,,,,,

As the mother of a nine-year-old daughter with severe peanut allergy, I wholeheartedly support a ban on peanut products on airlines.  My daughter Emory and I flew on Southwest Airlines for the first time recently and I was horrified when the flight attendant passed out packets of peanuts.  I was not aware that any airlines still used peanuts for a snack since I have not encountered this for many years.  The passenger sitting next to my daughter kindly offered not to eat her own peanuts, which somewhat reassured me.  However, relying on the conscientiousness of individual passengers is not sufficient.

Please protect my daughter and everyone else who is allergic to peanuts by banning peanuts on airlines.

Emily Hull and Emory Hoelscher-Hull",,,,,,,

The reason is that I have a severe milk protein (casein) allergy and I bring peanut butter as my food alternative to the cheese and milk products that is also a significant part of the food provided on airplanes.  I already must bring small quantities as part of my TSA regulated 1 qt bag of liquids and gels.  

The recycled air argument opens the door for the rule to be expanded from the airline not serving a food to banning an individual passenger from bringing a particular food.  This would make it difficult or impossible for me to do the traveling that is required by my job and seems questionable on enforcement from a civil rights perspective.  Peanuts are only one of many allergens.  What about perfumes or other air spread issues, such as the common cold virus.

It would be nice if a peanut free seating option could be offered to help from immediate adjacent exposure, but trying to eliminate the food altogether from the environment is not reasonable.   A better option would seem to be to require airlines to introduce more fresh air into their ventilation systems and improve air filtering technologies.",,,,,,,

As a parent of 2 nut allergic children i am extremely aware of our surroundings on airplanes and waiting for an allergic response. my only prevention iis to wipe down surfaces and my childrens hands and keep my fingers crossed.
 I am unclear on the need to serve nut products on flights. there are many ""snack"" products available that do not physically contain nuts that are good. Pretzels,dried fruit, nut free granola bars for example. I as a parent usually have my own snacks for the kids, so i am not suggesting extreme measures ie "" not serving products produced on a line that produces nuts""- but only suggesting that the ailines not provde the nut products.
When anaphalaxis occurs there is not a lot of time once epinepherine is given to then seek the care of a physician.
eliminating the serving of these products would help the 3 million sufferers of these life threatening reactions.
I hope that simple solutions that should not impact costs, nor 
customer comfort such as above is seriously considered.

After the mechanics and pilots tried for the 3rd time to reboot the system, they should have been deplaning the passengers.  Instead, we sat for another hour.  The aircraft had been powered down the majority of that time, so it was hot, and people were getting irritated.  This is just one story, and I’m sure there are hundreds more like it.  This was also before the April changes took effect, so that may have helped, but I still think there is room for improvement in the airline customer care sector.  I do think it is imperative that airlines be held responsible for the safety and comfort of their passengers.  They need to be required to get people where they need to go in a timely manner.  We all know that flights are going to be cancelled or changed.  Its how airlines deal with these challenges that effects how we respond to them.  If we are met with honest information and friendly agents, we are less likely to have an issue with changes.  When we are crammed into a plane with 175 other people with no air or water for 3 or 4 or 5 hours, that’s when we become irrational.  The DOT definitely needs to look at implementing more changes to protect airline passengers.",,,,,,,

Before my daughter experienced a reaction to peanut butter, and was subsequently diagnosed with a peanut allergy, I never thought anything about it.  However, now that my daughter has a potentially life-threatening condition, I think that the proposed ban is a very good idea.  People with severe peanut allergies can die simply by being exposed to airborne peanut proteins.  On an airplane, with a limited number of Auto Injectors such as the EpiPen, an allergic person could very conceivably die before the plane could land and have the person taken to a hospital.  Allergies aren't a joke.  Nobody wants them.  Nobody wants their child to have them.  This is simply a matter of peanut allergies being on the rise, for whatever reason, and therefore we must all do our part to help those who suffer from them.  I encourage you to completely ban peanuts on airplanes.  Even a partial ban might not be good enough if there is peanut protein residue left behind from previous passengers.

In the past, he has reacted to air born peanut particles and this was documented by medical professionals. A contact or inhaled source can cause him to have a severe reaction. This can happen with peanuts, peanut butter or just about any product with peanuts. However, some are worse than others as a bag of peanuts might have powder or dust or if something is cooked with nuts in it or peanut oil it will release fumes. We avoid flying whenever possible and I cannot even begin to tell you about the fear and anxiety associated with getting in a small sealed cylinder where the possibility of large amounts of the allergen being released is a strong possibility. When we do fly, we try to find airlines that do not serve peanuts and have procedures in place to accommodate people with life threatening allergies. However, we have had VERY mixed experiences, even on airlines that have strong policies. You are at the mercy of the gate attendants and flight crews. On one flight, we have an excellent experience. The gate agents made an announcement, the flight crew made more than one accouchement, they allowed us to pre-board to wipe down the area and allowed us to sit in the back of the plane. On the return flight on the same airline we were ignored and even had to argue with the flight attendant to make an announcement. Finally, we asked the other flight attendant and an announcement was made after we were airborne. We still had to sit on pins and needles because the people in front of us were sitting with their personal bags of peanuts wondering if they could open them. So there needs to be something on a federal level so there is uniformity and there needs to be some way to enforce a peanut free flight, however minor (maybe a small fine to passengers or something similar to how smokers would be handled on board. If you will recall, smoking on planes was also allowed before). If someone else’s second hand smoke can be harmful to someone’s health, it should not be allowed on planes. Someone else’s second hand peanuts can immediately kill my son in an enclosed space like a plane. Some people get angry and feel as if their rights are being violated. I’m sure that peanut farmers will lobby against this as I’m sure big tobacco lobbied against smoking bans.  But these are people’s lives we’re talking about. We don’t have the option of getting off and sometimes we need to fly. If there is a reaction, the plane will be diverted and someone could die. An epinephrine injection is not always 100% effective. People often die even after getting epinephrine injections. It is not the solution and is only an emergency treatment. The only option for us is avoiding dangerous situations where we might come in contact with peanuts. A peanut free buffer zone is not adequate as the air on board is recycled. Also, there is no enforcement or consequences should someone in this buffer zone eat peanuts and put someone at risk. In less enclosed environments, this is not as much of an issue. We are also able to leave the area. On a plane, someone 10 rows down could open something and it will can make it’s way to us. Not to mention that there is no uniformity in how airlines approach this. No person with a peanut allergy feels comfortable getting on a plane that has a “buffer zone”. In fact, presented with that as the only option last year, we did not fly and drove 20 hrs instead. I would say that prevented someone with a disability from getting on an airplane. This is different than most other food allergies (except maybe nuts) as it has the possibility of causing airborne and contact reactions. Also, it is the most common allergy. 

1)	I think a good step would be to ban airlines from serving peanuts. The dust, etc.. creates a unique problem.

2)	Better would be to ban them from serving any peanut containing products.

3)	Best yet, would be a ban on products served by the airline and some kind of fine or possible repercussions to people that open their own on board on a well designated peanut free flight. Some people get really angry and might do things intentionally because they feel their rights are violated. What about the right of my son to live? Have a big peanut free sign as people board, an announcement before people board and prior to taking off. If they are unable to wait 2 hrs for their peanuts, they have the option of another flight. Maybe airlines could designate dedicated peanut free flights and planes to each destination they fly? I’m not sure there is a good answer for the peanuts people bring on board. You are either going to have to offend a certain small segment of the population, are going to possibly cause someone to get sick or die or they will not feel safe getting on a plane.",,,,,,,

It is quite another to have an entire group of people open up bags of peanuts almost simultaneously and then have that peanut filled air recirculated. That is a lot of peanut dust! 
Peanuts are not essential to life. No one has to have peanuts or they will die. Everyone should be able to make it through a flight without eating a bag of peanuts. Individuals who have food allergies should be able to fly safely, providing their own epi pens and wiping down their area and being proactive as possible. 

We recently flew to Florida, from the Northwest. We had buffer zones on our flights and we had no incidents. The flight attendants were very helpful and tried their best to accomodate us. It was still stressful because previous passengers had been eating peanuts and they were on the floor where we were seated. We don't see why banning peanuts snacks is such a controversial option. It's just a bag of peanuts!

No one wants to have a food allergy. No one wants to be at risk of dying from ingesting a nut. No one wants to take a risk that great when flying and not having access to a hospital. No one chooses this to irritate others and infringe on their rights. It is something we have to live with and we are dependent, in many cases, on the compassion and graciousness of others.",,,,,,,

Banning peanuts on commercial flights would help protect the lives of people with nut allergies, including many children.

I believe a government ban is necessary because many airlines have demonstrated their unwillingness to implement their own policies to effectively protect passengers with nut allergies.  My anecdotal experience includes airline employees berating my wife for requesting they not serve peanuts and fellow passengers' sarcasm when told by flight crews that nuts will not be served because of an allergic passenger.  While these reactions may be attributed to being uninformed about the life-threatening nature of nut allergies, a regulatory ban will ensure airlines take steps to minimize the risk.",,,,,,,

If passengers bring items with peanuts/tree nuts in them on board they could be asked not to open and eat them while on board.

We haven't traveled on a plane in almost six years because of the fear of exposing our children to an unsafe environment.

Unfortunately, food allergies are on the rise. This is the new reality. Even if airline companies only want to consider the impact to their bottom-line. I can only imagine how much potential revenue they are losing because of families like mine choosing alternative ways to travel.

Just how severe are my sons' allergies? I have no idea. Since being diagnosed, we have taken every precaution to make sure they are not exposed again. The real fear with an anaphylactic reaction is the unknown. Your first anaphylactic reaction, could be fatal. And you only have minutes to try to reverse it and seek medical attention immediately. An impossible reality locked in an airplane 30,000 feet up in the air.

So my family has chosen to all but stop traveling because of this unknown fear. How does a mother sign her children up to be put in a situation where she has little to no control over it if something were to go wrong? What if the traces of airborne peanut particles is enough to start an allergic reaction that leads to an asthma or an anaphylactic attack. Could I hope that we could land the plane within minutes after injecting one of my sons with an epi-pen, not likely. 

See, we're not talking about the risk of experiencing an inconvenient discomfort like sneezing or maybe feeling a little ill. We're talking about the possibility of my sons' airways potentially closing off so they can no longer breathe. That risk is too big to take. So we choose not to fly.

Peanuts and peanut products have to be restricted entirely on all airline flights. And I LOVE peanuts. But the alternative is too big of a risk. We would never allow passengers to fly with loaded guns right? A peanut is the same threat to my sons. It could take their lives just as easily.",,,,,,,

You need to change the voluntary bumping rules not the involuntary rules. In the twenty years of flying I have only seen one time when someone was involuntary bumped from a plane. It just does not happen often. I have seen over 100 times, almost every time I fly people volunteering for a bump. The last time the airline was only giving you 150 for compensation. The most I ever heard over the loud speaker was 300 for a ticket and that was when the next flight was the next day.If you increase the amount that airlines must pay for involuntary bumped then the airline will give you even less compensation for voluntary to make up the difference.The issue should be on voluntary not involuntary compensation. Airlines have not increased the amount of voluntary bumping in the last 15 years I have been flying. You need to change this. The airlines will never increase compensation for voluntary unless you make them.  It is the only thing I know of that has not gone up. They have been reducing what they have been giving you over the years. Delta back in the 90’s would give you an unrestricted full fare round trip ticket with no cap for the value. It was an unrestricted Y coach class ticket that you could use even if there was one seat left on the plane. It had no money value but you knew you were getting a roundtrip ticket for your trouble. Those days are over. Please come up with a universal standard for voluntary bumping like 400 if less than 2 hrs and 600 if more than 2 hrs wait for your next flight. Then just double that amount for involuntary bumping. Keep it simple and make it apply to all airlines.",,,,,,,

I was very excited to see that this very serious issue has finally been addressed. My 17 month old son is SEVERELY allergic to peanuts. He started to go into anaphylaxis just from the skin test. It is so severe, that anyone who has ingested peanuts cannot even touch him for 24 hours. He has had reactions from foods that were made in the same facility as peanuts and/or on the same equipment peanuts have been on. I have to carry an Epi Pen at ALL times-cannot even run into the store without it. Traces of peanuts are lurking everywhere. Taking him on a flight would absolutely be out of the question unless peanuts were completely banned-as well as all traces of them. Due to the large amount of people with a peanut allergy-especially children-and ESPECIALLY children that cannot even talk yet or begin to comprehend the deathly consequences  of a peanut reaction.  PLEASE ban peanuts from airplanes-are they really that crucial to a good flight? Isn't it far more beneficial to know that an innocent person-child-would not be a victim of serious allergic reaction while just trying to travel? It would be really nice to know that I could comfortably travel by air with my child someday-hopefully in the not-so-distant future. Thank you for your serious consideration!",,,,,,,

My luggage was lost by Alitalia in Dec and they still owe me $1465.00. I landed in Milan on Sat., 12/12 (overnight flight), after waiting 2 hours, and realizing luggage was lost,  I was told to repurchase everything I would need for my week vacation because Alitalia informed me that they could not get my luggage to me until Sat.,12/19, (one week later; and I was returning home 12/20.) I was very accommodating but they refused to have my luggage delivered to any of the cities that we were going to be in during the week and so we had to return to the first city at the end of our trip to retrieve it.  
Because we were changing cities everyday on this “vacation,”and the luggage they lost was my ONLY piece of luggage, I not only had to buy all of my clothing, shoes, boots (it was snowing), makeup, toiletries, but I also had to buy luggage!
Alitalia assured that I would be reimbursed as long as I kept all my (itemized) receipts and submitted a claim when I returned to the states. After almost 4 months, I didn’t hear from them, and when I followed up, they lied and told me that my luggage was 
returned to me the following day, and then denied my claim.  Naturally, I had proof that they were lying, (I received my luggage one week later, not one day later], and so then they made up a nonexistent reimbursement policy, (there is no such policy, I have all the paperwork from Italy,  and there is no such policy on their website), and so then they offered me $225*, instead of the $1465* they owe me.  (I have not received a penny).
*Toothpaste, toothbrush, comb, hand cream, makeup deodorant, sneakers and a tote bag, which I bought and used as LUGGAGE because it was cheaper, cost me $270.00! They offered me $225 as a “settlement” (which I never received), and WHAT ABOUT THE COST OF MY CLOTHES, BOOTS, UNDERWEAR?? WHAT ABOUT THE COST OF MY CABS, BUSES (to find these stores), AND PHONE CALLS (to track down my lost luggage)??
A simple search online will show you that Alitalia does not ever pay for lost luggage. 
When they lost my luggage, they ruined my entire vacation. 
I did nothing wrong – I should not be expected to pay for replacing the clothes that they lost.

Peanut Allergies""

I support a ban on peanuts and products containing peanut protein on airlines.

My son has a life-threatening, anaphalactic allergy to peanuts and is unable to fly on an airplane unless the carrier agrees to not provide peanuts and products containing peanuts on the flight.

An airplane increases the risk of death for those with such peanut allergies:
1. The close quarters of aircraft seating increase the chance that allergy sufferers are exposed to peanuts
2. The recycled air spreads dust from peanut products throughout the cabin, which cannot be avoided by the allergy sufferer.
3. If one suffers an allergic reaction and uses their Epi-Pen
(epinephrine) to avoid choking to death, the process is to call 911 for emergency treatment. Epinephrine can cause heart attacks and other complications.
Obviously, emergency response treatment cannot be made available while in an aircraft.

There are a multitude of other foods available for airline carriers to provide their passengers. Non-peanut alternatives would not pose any burden to neither the airlines nor the passengers, but would eliminate the risk of death to those who suffer from severe peanut allergies.

The alarming growth in peanut allergies poses a challenge to the medical research community. We all hope for a better understanding of such diseases of the human immune system, leading to safe, effective preventative treatments and a cure.
Until that time, simple steps to avoid peanut exposure are the moral and ethical responsibility of our people.",,,,,,,

This is a huge hardship for us, as her peanut allergy was diagnosed just after we moved to the US from Britain, and we are unable to fly home with the children to visit family, or even in the case of a family emergency.

To indicate the severity of her allergy, her forearm broke out in raised and angry hives from simply reaching into a bag of (closed) packets of Halloween candy (which were likely covered with nutdust from the factory).  And her face came out in an angry rash after a 30 minute visit to a friend's house where she stood near a gerbil cage – their food contained peanuts.  Both were minor reactions, but were caused by such minute exposures that they give clear warning of the severity of reaction that would result from any greater exposure.

Given that, the danger to her from sitting on a plane where hundreds of other passengers are tearing open packets of nuts is simply too great a risk.  Although a buffer zone is a nice gesture, the closed ventilation system of the plane renders it nearly useless.  Indeed, even if nuts are not served on our particular flight, she would still be at great risk from sitting in a seat where every previous passenger had been served peanuts and left residue on the seat arms, tray table, seat belt, etc.

Nuts cause the most severe allergies and are the allergen most likely to cause fatalities; they produce dust and oils that make them particularly likely to contaminate surfaces.  The nature of air travel creates an uniquely dangerous environment due the inability to quickly get to a hospital.  Emergency medications can stop reactions, but sometimes simply buy time -- maybe a few hours, maybe only 20 minutes.  If a reaction occurs on board a flight where it's not easy to land, this could create an extremely dangerous situation.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2010-0140-0339/attachment_1.docx",

Emergency pilot landings for anaphylaxsis are scarey for all passengers; expensive for travelers & airlines; and very disruptive to all.  

Eliminating peanut/tree nuts from circulation within the airplane would help reduce the risk of a life-threatening emergency.

I have a 9 year old granddaughter that is air-born peanut allergic.  You have no idea the fear that many of us have lived due to the diagnosis.  She will never go in a dairy, see a circus or consume many foods.  The labeling changes have been a true blessing.  To say that the ruling would consider a 'peanut free zone' on a public airline is like saying that there is a ""no pee zone in a public pool"".  Seriously, Please consider an entire ban of peanuts.  There is little value to others for an item that could take lives.  Such a ruling would allow our family to attend Disney with our granddaughter.  One of the few public enjoyments that work to keep children safe.  Thank you again for allowing and considering public comment on this topic.

My son has a very serious airborne peanut allergy. This means that if someone is eating peanuts and he inhales even a small particle of ""peanut dust"" he will have a reaction.  This has happened to him when someone who was over 6 feet away started eating peanuts.  This was not on an airplane, but if it had been, we would not have been able to get out of the area and into a safe place.  On a plane, there is no ""safe place.""  During a reaction, an Epipen will simply buy you time (about 20 minutes) to get to an ER...it does not stop the reaction permanently.  It is not realistic to think that a plane could land and get us to the ER in time.  

This should be a permanent change - not one that is only used upon request by a peanut allergic passenger.  If there are peanuts on the plane from a different flight, there will still be peanut residue around that can cause a reaction from inhalation or simply touching an area that may have some unknown residue.  

A ""buffer"" zone, does not provide a safe enough environment because the tiny particles of peanut dust can float all around the plane. 

I strongly encourage this regulation against all type of peanut products on airplanes.  It should also be extended to prohibiting passengers from carrying on peanut butter sandwiches, peanut m&m's and other items containing peanuts.  

Please seriously consider making this change to the regulations.  You may be saving a life in the process.  Thank you so much for considering this.  There are many people who have allergies like my son, and it would be wonderful if air travel could be safe for everyone.",,,,,,,

My daughter has a severe allergy to peanuts/tree nuts which prohibits us from flying on ANY airline that allows peanuts/tree nuts on board.  If even a tiny particle of peanut/tree nut enters her eyes, nose or mouth, her face and throat swells and she could stop breathing within minutes.  It will ultimately result in her death if medical attention is not given IMMEDIATLY.  Every second she goes without treatment could mean her life.  A dose of epinephrine may not be 100% effective.  Although we carry her RX wherever we go, we don't even want to put her at risk to having a reaction.

I believe airlines should prohibit the distribution of ANY peanut or tree nut product, as well as forbid passengers to bring or open any paenut/tree nut product onboard.  We're talking life and death here....not just hives or sneezing.  This is a serious issue for my family - I feel it is so unfair that we can't utilize air travel.... however I am not willing in any way to put my child's life in danger just because airlines feel the need to allow peanut-eating onboard.  There are PLENTY of alternitives available.  I'm SURE if passengers took one look at my daughter and knew that by opening their bag of penuts could kill her....they'd understand and be sympathetic.  It's an allergy she has no control over.  It's pathetic that the airlines can't see how dangerous they're making their cabins.  Might as well give someone on board a loaded gun, aim it at my 7-year-old daughter's head..... and pull the trigger.  Same thing as opening a bag of peanuts in the seat next to her.

I hope you serioulsy consider banning these products from airlines.  Keep our skies safe.....especially for the little ones who count on us to keep THEM safe.",,,,,,,

We avoid flying any airline that serves peanuts because we do not know how our son would react if 150 people opened bags of peanuts and ate them in an enclosed area.  We'd rather not find out.

Although a buffer zone has been suggested, I don't see how, in an airplane where air is recycled, that would help.  It is just not worth the anxiety or risk to us.

Our son religiously carries an Epi-pen, but to the best of our understanding, the requirement with epinephrine is that once a patient is injected, he/she is to call an ambulance and be immediately transported to the hospital.  I would imagine on board that this would be considered a medical emergency and the plane would have to land, causing great inconvenience to everyone else on board.

In my opinion, of the options up for decision, it seems it might be easier to just prohibit the serving of peanuts, at least on any flights where a peanut allergy was listed on the reservation ahead of time.  We have flown with our son on airlines where no peanuts are served, and we have never heard anyone complain about getting pretzels.

I guess when it comes to people not getting to eat peanuts on a 2-3 hour flight or my son being at risk to die, it's a pretty simple choice in my mind.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

The major concern, obviously, is about deadly anaphylactic reactions, which are significantly more common with peanut allergies than any other type of food allergy. A secondary concern is less severe reactions--more typical with airborne exposure--which leaves the sufferer physically injured (e.g., itchy breakouts of hives, difficulty breathing (asthmatic reactions), eczema breakouts that often take days or weeks to heal through topical steriod applications).

All of these reactions can be limited, though perhaps not eliminated, by restricting peanuts, and particularly airline distribution of peanuts, on airplanes. It would be an innocuous ban. Some commenters have complained that they would be ""inconvenienced"" by a ban on peanuts, which is a silly complaint based on expectation of a non-guaranteed service. One could very well make the complaint that they are already so inconvienced by not being served banana splits or cheese fondue on flights. Receiving crackers or pretzels as a snack instead of peanuts is hardly an inconvenience, it is a mutually beneficial alternative. The smoking bans on airlines have been truly, and rightfully, inconveniencing smokers--to the benefit of the general population--on all US flights for 10 years and on most US slights for more than 20 years and the American people, their elected representatives, and the courts have agreed that the smoking bans are appropriate.

Unfortunate as it may be, peanut proteins are far more deadly and damaging (in the short term, at least) to allergy sufferers than second-hand smoke is to the general population. The problem is that there are too few allergy suffers to mount a broad-based public support campaign. It is precisely and necessarily the right and role of government to protect and advocate for disadvantaged minorities.",,,,,,,

There are many alternatives that airlines can use...pretzels, cookies, etc.   The economic issues brought up by the peanut industry are secondary to the health concerns of passengers.

What most people unfamiliar with this issue fail to realize is that peanuts are deadly to those who are allergic. It is not like some other food allergies that cause mild irritation or other benign symptons. Peanuts will literally kill him if untreated very quickly. And peanuts are in a great many food products that you would never even think of. People who disagree have obviously never seen a child go into anaphylactic shock. Ban them.",,,,,,,

By many estimates, nut allergies are present in roughly 1% of the population.  This means that on average there will be at least one person with a nut allergy on any plane with at least 100 people on it.  Based on this, I feel comfortable in saying that there is arguabley a passenger with a nut allergy on the majority of flights that operate in the US.  Nut allergy sufferers are probably less likely to travel by air, but that is hard to account for.

From there it is a pretty simple cost/benefit comparison:

the pain of mild exposure to allergens + the risk of severe allergic reaction in mid-flight + lack of access to air travel for people with severe allergies vs. the difference in the passengers' enjoyment between nuts and the replacement snack (let's say pretzels)

Looking at it that way, it is an absolute no-brainer.  Do people really enjoy peanuts so much that the enjoyment lost in a switch to pretzels outweighs these costs? Absolutely not. 

In fact, I enjoy pretzels more than peanuts, so a forced switch to a snack other than peanuts may be a net gain for me. On many Delta flights (on which I fly over 60,000 miles a year), they offer a choice of three snacks - peanuts, pretzels, or Biscoff cookies. By my admittedly unscientific observation, peanuts are the least popular choice. If this is true, it proves that snack other than peanuts are preferred by a majority of flyers.  

Which minority should we protect - the one that has risk of death or at least severe discomfort with the exposure to nut allergens or the one that prefers peanuts over cookies and pretzels?

Any of these ridiculous notions about the loss of jobs in the peanut industry (which is large in my own state) are nullified by the gains in production of replacement snacks.

If peanuts are banned for a food allergy, which most do not consider a disability because it is controllable by the person who has it, then people will be demanding more and more regulation for small pointless things also because of a disability.  For example, I have a true disability with Epilepsy and the triggers to my siezures are lack of sleep (I do suffer from insomnia) and stress.  Now while traveling a long distance flight what are some things that happen:  1) You want to take an early flight (end up losing some sleep) 2) The boarding process (if that isn't stress I don't know what is then)  **** These are just before you board.  3)  I don't know about others but sleeping on a flight is not always so easy if you have two old lady travelers on one side of you who can't stop talking and a big a huge guy on the other side that is taking up half of your seat and snoring so loudly you feel like you are at the world cup listening to all the vuvuzelas.

Now, since epilepsy is really considered more of a disability than a food allergy I would rank my following ideas more justifiable, well maybe not, but if this regulation is past this is how a lot of people will be seeing things.  First, I would demand that people with my disability be seated in first class to allow them the comfort to gain back the rest needed to prevent a siezure and causing an emergency stoppage.  Second, I would request that the old ladies and big people have to sit next to each other because the old lady talking might keep the big people up and stop their snoring or the big people taking up the old lady space might shut up the old ladies.  Third, I would require that all epileptics receive a full body massage while in first class to reduce the stress which also reduces the likelyhood of having a siezure.",,,,,,,

Peanuts are oily; therefore even if my son is careful not to eat any peanuts, peanut residue may still be left on seat cushions and trays; we wipe down as much as we can and try to put a clean blanket/towel on his seat, but we can only be so careful.  Most important, however, is to stop heating peanuts/peanut sauce on planes; from everything I've read, it's heating the proteins that is most likely to cause a serious allergic reaction just from being in the air, especially in the circulating air of an airplane cabin.

Life-threatening food allergies are on the rise.  Children are the most affected.  Because parents increasingly move in order to find employment -- a larger social trend exacerbated by the recession -- many families live a plane flight away from grandparents and extended family, making air travel a necessity.  All of these society-wide changes have come together to create the perfect storm whereby many families with allergic children must fly.

Some, though not all, of these children are deathly allergic to airborne peanut particles.  Those who are not allergic to airborne particles but are allergic to peanuts never know what might happen in the next attack.  It is the most dangerous and unpredictable allergy, which is why everyone with this allergy must carry one (or more) epinephrine injector(s).  Knowing that peanuts will not be on board will help assuage anxiety.  The thought of dealing with a life-threatening anaphylactic attack in mid-air is a terrifying prospect.

There are plenty of snack options in lieu of peanuts and tree nuts for passengers.  When one weighs the scales -- on the one hand, the vast array of snack choices, plus the fact that a passenger who truly loves peanuts and tree nuts may eat them upon arrival at his/her destination -- against the other hand, the potential negative from continuing to allow peanuts and tree nuts on board (a possible death) -- it seems a far safer and prudent public policy to ban peanuts and tree nuts.  Perhaps once scientists are able to develop more effective and proactive treatments for this life-threatening allergy, DOT can reconsider the ban.",,,,,,,

i don't understand how others could feel inconvenienced by such a simple thing.  airlines in europe don't serve peanuts.  the snacks could easily be replaced by safer ones.  my concern is that peanut allergies in particular tend to be the most dangerous in that people that develop anaphylactic reactions to food tend to be those with a peanut allergy.

i am terrified to travel with my son on domestic flights.  please ban them for the sake of the children as well as the potential for emergency situations in which everyone on the flight would be affected.  no one wants to have to have an emergency landing!

However, we have had VERY mixed experiences, even on airlines that have strong policies. You are at the mercy of the gate attendants and flight crews. It is disheartening to have the lives of your children at the hand of others who might not understand the severity of the food allergies. There needs to be something on a federal level so there is uniformity, a peanut free buffer zone is not adequate as the air on board is recycled. Also, there needs to be some way to enforce a peanut and tree nut free flight,  right now there is no enforcement or consequences should someone sitting in the buffer zone eat peanuts and put someone at risk. If there is some uniformity not only will the lives of many be safer, but also, business will increase for airlines due to many families with allergies currently having to find other modes of transportation. 
It is not feasible to support those that claim an infringement of their ""rights"" by being denied peanuts or tree nuts in flight. Many substances that can harm or kill passengers are limited or restricted during a flight (such as cigarettes, aerosols, carry on liquids bigger than 1 oz., guns and knives), so risky allergens, such as peanuts and tree nuts, should be banned as well.

Just suppose a traveler with a different type of disability was assailed by a fellow traveler.  Based on the ADA, the disabled traveler is to be given safe travel, and presumably, airline personnel would come to the aid of the person being assailed. Why, then, is it permissible for someone to offend the peanut allergy sufferer with no intervention?  
Safe breathing space is safe breathing space.  Period.  If ADA is to mean anything, than all disabilities must be covered, not only the ones that are convenient or accepted in popular culture.",,,,,,,

I do not believe that a condition that affects one percent of the population should infringe upon the rights of the other ninety-nine.  If you include peanut allergies in the category of disabilities, where you do draw the line?  Those who can't tolerate pet dander?  Perfume?  Milk?  And even if you say ""peanut allergies only"" because of the severity of the problem, what would a peanut ban mean?  That I can't bring peanuts onboard the plane?  Peanut-butter-flavored cookies?  Anything with peanut oil?  Will you strip search travelers at the gate to ensure they have no Nutter Butters on their person?  

Please consider the fact that no one wants to live in a police state, even that with the best of intentions, and I do believe that these restrictions smack of that sensibility, if only on a small scale.  Freedom of choice is something we pride ourselves on in this country.  The minority who experience this problem have the choice to avoid air travel, just as I should have the choice to eat what I want, especially something that is harmless to 99% of the population.  Don't let the special interests of a few restrict the freedom of the many, especially when they have alternate means of transportation at their disposal.

I think peanuts should absolutely be banned on airlines. We are talking about a life and death situation here. The situation is only getting worse as the number of peanut allergy sufferers has been significantly increasing over the past several years. 

People like to talk about their rights when it comes to situations like this. Yes, we live in a country that has afforded us the personal liberties to live the lives of our choosing. However, we are talking about the right to eat peanuts on a flight! Would people be willing for a person to die just so they could eat their precious 2 oz bag of salted peanuts? I truly hope that this rule is passed so that it does not have to get to that point. 

While I think it is important that the government be cautious about not overstepping its boundaries, this is a matter of public health and safety. I think it is more important that nut allergy sufferers fly without a constant fear of suffering anaphylactic shock than someone else being able to have their peanuts.",,,,,,,

For individuals like my 6 year old son who have an airbourne allergy to peanuts, exposure of any kind can be life threatening.  A buffer zone, is essentially ineffective with airbourne allergies as is simply banning peanuts from a particular flight since airplane air is re-circulated.  
There are plenty of other snack options that can be offered, what is the obsession with peanut products???
It is much safer and easier to ban peanut products than to have to make an emergency landing if a person suffers an anaphylactic reaction.  
As for passengers bringing peanut products onboard, airlines can make it a policy to announce overhead the presence of a peanut allergic indivudual and kindly ask others to refrain from eating peanut products for the duration of the flight.  If folks need/want to eat peanut products so desperately, they can certainly wait until the de-board the flight.......
""1. Banning the serving of peanuts and all peanut products by both U.S. and foreign carriers on flights covered by DOT's disability rule.

2. Banning the serving of peanuts and all peanut products on all such flights where a passenger with a peanut allergy is on board and has requested a peanut-free flight in advance.

3. Requiring a peanut-free buffer zone in the immediate area of a passenger with a medically-documented severe allergy to peanuts if passenger has requested a peanut-free flight in advance.""",,,,,,,

The air transportation industry would do a great service to persons with anaphylactic peanut allergies by banning all peanut products on airplanes. At the very least, the industry should forbid the serving of peanuts and peanut products on domestic and international flights. The danger for those who are allergic is not just from ingesting the allergen but also from coming into contact with it (peanut particles left on a seat tray, peanut butter inadvertently smeared on a bathroom door handle etc.) As well, every flight should keep epinephrine auto-injectors on board in case of emergency and flight attendants should be trained how to use the device.",,,,,,,

I support the NO PEANUTS option because I do not believe seats, armrests, floors, rest-rooms, etc can be cleaned well enough to protect my son after someone else has been eating nuts in that seat.  If we board a flight and sit in a safe-zone, there's no telling if the previous flight had a safe-zone or not.  If a passenger before my son ate peanuts and touched the arm rest, then my son touches the arm rest, it could kill him, literally. Plus, being in the air, there is no emergency landing quick enough to save him.  Going compeletely peanut free is the only way to improve safety. This includes not allowing any snacks containing nuts to be brought on board by passengers.  Please understand other nuts usually have been cross-contaminated so they should also be disallowed.

It is reported that 15-20% of the population may suffer from some form of food allergy. The most frequent foods which may cause a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) are fish, egg whites, berries, milk and legumes, most notably, peanuts. The peanut is responsible for allergic reactions in both adults and children. Peanut allergy is most likely, the most common cause of death due to food anaphylaxis in the U.S.
It is my feeling that the PATIENT should take the full responsibility for his/her health issues. The question is, should the DOT make standards to the airlines so that a flight an allergic patient may take, is an allergy free flight. I think this would be impossible! Remember, peanuts are not the sole issue. What about those who may be sensitive to milk or eggs? 
What about food allergens that might circulate in the airports and restaurants the allergic person may be exposed. 
I feel it's the allergic persons responsibility to take their own precautions. They must be on their daily anti-allergic medications. They must carry their own epinephrine auto-injector.
Yes, most if not all airlines carry emergency AED's for people who may have a heart attack while on board. But they are not required to carry insulin for diabetics who may need an emergency dose nor do they stock sub-lingual medications for acute heart pain.
Where does it ever end? It does not! Let's be sensible about this. Public transportation is just that, plain (plane) and simple.

As a mother of a young child with a life-threatening peanut allergy, it is always frightening taking a flight knowing that passengers may pull out peanuts at any time, wipe peanut butter on the arms of the airline seats, bathroom door knobs etc and that many airlines actually serve them! An Epipen will provide about 10-20 minutes of 'breathing time' after an allergic reation- and the next step is to get to a hospital as the reaction may recurr. On a plane- especially a long flight to Australia from the US (for example) you can't do this. It is a case of finger's- crossed and as much precaution that I can take.

THE REASON ANAPHYLAXIS IS CONSIDER A ""DISABILITY"" IS THAT BREATHING IS CONSIDERED A NECESSARY PART OF LIFE AND IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGIC ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO BREATHE.

The reason that peanuts are more allergic then other items is that their protein is harder for anyone to breakdown then other foods, that is why an allergic reaction to a peanut is more threatening the other foods.  
   
It is not that someone 10 rows up might open a snickers bar, the scary part comes from passengers opening bags of peanuts that have dusty particles that circulate through the cabin and can be easily inhaled.

I would hope that people in general would understand that we randomly landed in the crazy allergy world  and would hope that maybe we could reach a compromise where non allergic passengers could eat pretzels or something on the flight and maybe Delta could pass out peanuts when passengers get off the plane.

 I am a regular person with no other allergies in mine or my husband's families. We have a 7 yr old son who tests 100+ (the highest you can test) to peanut and has asthma (asthma makes any allergy reaction worse as breathing is already compromised) He has learned to adapt to the world around him, he caries 2 epi-pens with him at al times, takes his on food to school, can't have the birthday cupcakes/cookies that other family brings in, he can't eat at most restaurants. 
  It is hard for me to understand is that it really is a life threatening condition so I get it that it seems ""silly.""  Epi-Pens will give you about 20mins if the parent, as a non medical professional, gives to him correctly and if you give it to him in the correct amount of time. 
  It is a very odd world that we have wound up in but all things considered we are glad that he can, run, laugh play, read, swim etc!    
  That said, we have not flown in 4 years.  We used to fly when we lived in Dallas because American doesn't serve peanuts, even then we would fly out on the first flight",,,,,,,

The suggestion of a peanut free area on a plane is not even an option.  The air is re-circulated throughout the plane which means that unless the people in the peanut free zone are located in a sectioned off room which is supplied with their own oxygen (which is unrealistic) that people who are allergic to peanuts will be breathing in the peanut air.  Allergies do not affect everyone the same way.  Some people do not have a deadly reaction when they breathe in the air, but for the few who do, getting on a plane with people who eat peanuts is along the lines of stepping in the path of a bullet.  If you are lucky, you won’t die.  

The real question is: Is it the right of everyone who are not allergic to peanuts to tell the people who are allergic that they need to risk their life to travel?  Do I think its right to tell someone that they can’t have a snack of their choice?  No, but if that snack could kill someone I think that it should be avoided in close quarters.  I do not think its right to not care about another human being and possibly cause their death.  It’s a tricky situation with an even trickier solution.

Here’s a list of things that people with peanut allergies have to think twice of doing:
Attend a Major League Baseball game; Go to the Mall if there is a Nut Stand; Attend the Movies since someone around you could have peanuts; Walk down the Street when they sell roasted nuts; Fly in an airplane; Go to a Bar; Eat out at a restaurant since many restaurants have some sort of nut dish on the menu and some even use peanut oil.

People with these allergies have to think about what they do and where they go each and everyday.  They have to think about the situation that they are putting themselves in.  They can not go out into a situation where they do not know anything about the place that they are going to.",,,,,,,

My husband is and officer in the Army and travel is always an issue.  I have learned that I can never be sure of what  will be served on the plane so now I drive with her.  If nuts and peanuts were taken off planes and there could be a buffer between us and other passengers bringing them on board I could safely travel by plane again.

FOR THE POLICYMAKERS:  if it were your own child with severe food allergies, you would be doing whatever it takes to get them banned.  These children did not have a choice or do anything wrong.  They were born with these allergies.  If you were allergic to something and someone had that item, regardless of what it was, sitting next to you in tight quarters, you would freak... i guarantee it...lawmakers especially.

The prevalence of life threatening peanut allergies make this potential ban one that could save lives and money.  Aboard an airplpane, the lack of access to quick medical attention is unique and dangerous.  Very serious anaphylaxis can start and kill quickly.  Many airlines do not serve food, except as a paid option on a flight.  Therefore, it should not be problematic to remove peanuts from the list of paid options.  There are many foods that are not offered for purchase, this can simply be one of them.  And as a cost savings measure for those airlines which still offer a small free snack, pretzels are less expensive and less threatening as an allergen when viewed from a number of deaths per year ratio.

I would be happy if requesting a peanut free flight was instituted but there are still major issues with cleaning between flights as I have had numerous experiences where we found nuts all over the floors and seats.  Creating a buffer zone is not sufficient and I would not take my child on a flight that only promised that.  As it currently stands, we only fly airlines that do not serve peanuts as snacks (such as United.)  If peanuts are baned on flights, all forms of them should be, including crackers, peanut butter and so on.

As for responsibility for ""peanut-free"" flight and epinephrine injectors, most people with life threatening peanut allergies understand that a regulation can not ensure a peanut free flight and that passengers will bring nuts on board.  It would help if an announcement was made to remind passengers that there may be other passengers with life threatening allergies on board.  I usually carry additional snacks with me to offer other passengers.

While it is a good practice for an airline to have Epipen on board, I would say that most individuals with life threatening food allergies do not board planes with at least 2 Epipens with them.  For an international flight, I usually bring 7.  Epipen is an emergency medication and should not be considered as prevention so peanuts still need to be dealt with.

Thank you very much for seriously considering this issue.  My family and the entire allergic community truly appreciates it.

Such rule making is a slippery slope as were does the line get drawn? 

This issue is not a rights issue but about reasonable accommodation. Passengers who have severe allergies should accommodated on an as needed basis. Whether it is pet allergies, perfumes, cats, dogs, peanuts, etc. Just like a person with a physical handicap should be reasonably accommodated.

My suggestion would be that a passenger who has a documented (letter signed by physician) allergy be able to request that a flight be free from that particular allergen. 

An as needed basis is reasonable otherwise the flights will become a sterile tube with passengers in bunny suits. With hazmat crews cleaning between flights.

Those with very severe reactions - such as coming into with an allergen will have to also take reason precautions. They must understand that it is impossible to ensure a flight is allergen free. For instance, a passenger's seat may have been the same seat that a parent may have given their child a peanut butter sandwich or a cat may have travelled under. It is impractical to sufficiently clean between each flight such that all allergens are removed. As such, passengers with allergies must to their part even if mean wearing a medical mask.

At the same time a passenger with an allergy must realize that their allergy does not trump another passenger being accommodated. For instance, if a passenger is traveling with a pet and purchased a ticket in advance of a person with a pet allergy then the person with the allergy has two choices take a different flight or continue on their current flight (and accept full responsibility if their presence causes an in flight emergency).

The affect of any rule making will require airlines to survey  passengers - however this surveying is no different than a passenger asking for a kosher meal.",,,,,,,

There is no reasonable way to totally ban peanuts from planes. In today's a la carte pricing world, many people (particularly families with children) are bringing food from home onto their flights. I imagine a non-trivial percentage of them bring peanuts or peanut butter as part of their in-flight picnic. They eat those foods on the seat back trays and leave trace amounts of nut oil, etc. I don't think that anyone would maliciously try to cause fellow passengers to have a sever allergic reaction, but someone who does not know the rules (as the many people who fly only a few times a year would not) could cause a dangerous allergic reaction unknowingly.

Allergy sufferers will develop a false sense of security if this ban is passed and not take the sensible precautions that allergy sufferers alone are responsible for to keep themselves safe (I say this as someone with food allergies). When, not if, someone has a severe reaction due to trace contamination, they will sue the airline. In America, a lawsuit is a given in such a case, but the airline has no way of preventing such exposure from food brought BY OTHER PASSENGERS. 

Worse, a peanut ban singles out one group for special treatment. What about people allergic to dairy? To fish or shellfish? To cats or dogs? To fragrances? Do you plan to ban every possible allergen? It simply is not possible. Does that mean that some people with severe allergies may not be able to fly? Yes. Should special case regulations be passed for every contingency? No. Some people (the very pregnant, those with severe heart conditions or compromised immune systems, etc) cannot fly because the balance of risk outweighs the rewards. This is no different.",,,,,,,

Studies have been done that prove this to be fact. With such a large number of peanut and tree nut allergy sufferers, I think it is becoming necessary that airlines look at their long-standing peanut tradition and consider other options, a measure that some have (thankfully) already taken.

I myself have a severe allergy to peanuts and tree nuts, and while I am ""lucky"" in the fact that I will not likely die from sitting next to someone eating peanuts on an airplane, it nevertheless is incredibly unpleasant because my health is compromised: My asthma begins to act up, and if any peanut dust lands on my skin I get a very itchy, uncomfortable rash in that spot. This has happened many times on airplanes. Unfortunately, air travel is the most convenient form of transportation for me, and often I have no choice but to fly if I have a business meeting to attend in another region of the country. So I must put up with this and knowingly put my health at risk because I have no choice.

I applaud some airlines that have given up the traditional peanut package in favor of snacks such as pretzels. Tell me: What is so wrong with pretzels? What is wrong with cheese snacks such as Cheezits or Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers? These are all perfectly acceptable snacks that would satisfy most people flying.

In regards to the arguments that this would hurt the peanut industry, well I'm sorry. But no doubt people still eat plenty of peanuts in this country, so I think they will survive. If I accidentally ingest a peanut while on an airplane though, there is a chance that I will not survive, along with one out of every 100 citizens in this country. And I think I speak many when I say that I do not want to die from something as trivial as a peanut.

Please consider banning peanuts. People might complain, but they will always be able to eat something else. I, however, will not.

That little pouch of peanuts does not provide for the nutritional needs of any human.

In addition, tree nuts should not be allowed on flights since most people with life-threatening peanut allergies are also allergic to tree nuts.  I am a mother of a child with severe peanut and tree nut allergies.  My son has experienced allergic reactions on the four US flights we have taken this year.  This occurred despite taking the precautions of alerting crew members before the flights and also cleaning the area around his seat.  The airline crews were accomodating and either did not serve nuts on the flight or created a nut-free zone around us.  All flights were with the same carrier- Jet Blue- yet each crew had differing and inconsistent policies on how to handle the situation.  Planes are not thoroughly cleaned between flights so even if our flights were nut-free, there was enough residue on the planes to cause his reactions.  Our experiences show that not serving nuts on a particular flight or creating a nut-free zone are not effective in preventing reactions in all situations.

I have a 4 year old son with a peanut allergy.  Most people do not understand the severity of the risk presented to individuals, but with the growing number of people, especially children, having allergic reactions to peanuts, this is a very important step toward air safety.
My son has never flown.  I am concerned that he may have a reaction and being in the air with a medical issue is not something I want to experience.  
On my last flight I was horrified as I watched a passenger in the row next to me take his packet of peanuts and dump them directly on the flight tray in front of him.  There were peanuts, dust, etc...  After he finished eating, he put the tray up.  I was thinking what would happen if my son was on the next flight in that seat.  Those trays are not cleaned between flights and the peanut residue is still there.
I simply think that it is in the public's best interest that peanut lovers enjoy their nuts on the ground, in the airport, or anywhere but on a confined space with circulated air.

Peanut allergies can generate life-threatening anaphylaxic shock in the presence of minute amounts of peanut material. This can be as little as that necessary to smell peanuts, which in my experience is quite powerful on flights which serve them.

In the event of anaphylaxis, prompt treatment with an epinephrine injector (Epi-pen) can mitigate immediate life-threatening symptoms, but must be followed by rapid medical care (thirty minutes or less) at a hospital to counteract its effects and stabilize the allergic reaction. Such access to prompt emergency care is not present in the airways, and thus precludes the use of effective anti-allergic reaction medications available to treat allergic shock due to peanuts or other food allergens.

This issue is personal to me as my wife was recently diagnosed with peanut allergies. As warned by her doctor, the sensitivity is becoming worse with age. 

In our experience with recent flights on Delta Airlines, packages of peanuts were distributed to all passengers, regardless of whether they asked for them. We are now seeking other preferred airline carriers to avoid the presence of peanuts.

Enforcement of the proposed regulation would allow us  to traverse the airways without having to take potentially life-threatening risk of allergic shock to peanuts -- an unfortunately more common and severe problem in the general US population.",,,,,,,

An anaphylactic response can happen quickly, and severely and can cause death. Most people are not aware of the severity of this allergy and do not understand the ramifications of not only ingesting a peanut, but getting peanut residue on one's hand and having a reaction. Or if a child puts his hand in his mouth and has an anaphylactic response.

I should note that, due to this allergy, and airlines inability to provide a safe environment in which we can fly, we have avoided air travel since she was diagnosed, over 8 years ago. Producing ""evidence"" of airborne reactions in an aircraft setting is probably nearly impossible, as I am certain most others with severe allergies have avoided air travel in the same fashion.  Banning peanuts/peanut products is the only way to ensure safety, since (1) one injection of epinephrine is only good for 15-20 minutes, clearly not enough time to land an aircraft and receive prompt medical attention; (2) it is impossible to create a ""peanut free zone"" for the allergic passenger, as recirculation of air containing peanut protein particles makes such a zone truly impossible and (3) the idea that a person must ingest the allergen in order to have a reaction is simply ignorant of the true scope of life-threatening allergies.  Clearly, there will be people who carry on their own snacks, and enforcing this would be difficult, however flight crew members who notice nuts are being eaten should have the responsibility to instruct the passenger to discard the items.

I SUPPORT the entire banning of peanut products on flights.  I DO have children w/severe allergies and would do whatever I need to protect them.  I have flown w/them several times and have had mixed results.  The issue w/peanuts on board is that people can and do react to contact and the particles in the air.  It's next to impossible to keep particles from the air in an enclosed space such as an airline.  I pretreat my children w/Benadryl before flying, but we have still had problems w/one of them reacting to a contact.  It is unknown to us whether it was peanuts for him or one of his other numerous allergies.  We are just fortunate that he did not have an anaphylactic episode.  The idea of my child or anyone else having an anaphylactic reaction to something on board a plane is terrifying as getting medical help ASAP is absolutely critical.  

I do understand that there are many that may not agree w/the banning of a particular food as people will say that is only just the beginning.  However, I consider peanuts to be one of the most high risk allergens due to the particles in the air.  I take any food my children may need w/me as I cannot/do not trust that there will be anything safe for my children when I travel.  I wipe down seats when I travel as well.  I just think it's better to be safe than sorry.  I also have had to deal with airlines NOT keeping flights peanut free even after being assured they will be.  I would think that would open up airlines to lawsuit or liability issue and that would impact the entire industry.  That does not seem like a financially stable decision to have partial banning.",,,,,,,

If my son needed to go to the bathroom and someone who had eaten nuts had been in the bathroom prior to him, there is no way to prevent the transmission of crumbs or peanut proteins left on the hands of the passenger who had the peanuts to other areas of the plane.  3.  Just the presence of peanuts in the area causes my son to have respiratory symptoms.  Short of putting him in a plastic bubble from boarding to departure, this would not help our situation at all.  Finally, I would like to say that this seems an easy decision based on the fact that if the airlines banned peanuts on all flights it would not effect the quality of flight for anyone.  Non-allergic passengers can live WITHOUT peanuts and enjoy other snacks while my son and others like him cannot live WITH peanuts.  It seems a very small price to pay for peanut allergic passengers to be able to travel like everyone else.  If someone has to eat something different on a flight, who does that really harm?  But if flights contain peanuts, which is like a loaded gun to an allergic person, the danger is immeasurable.  PLEASE pass this law banning peanuts on all flights for us and our son!!!!!!",,,,,,,

As for banning peanuts on airlines: I think it's ridiculous that the majority should have to pay for the health issues of the minority.  I am a school nurse and deal with children with peanut allergies every day.  We provide alternative meals and snacks for students with peanut allergies, but we do not ban peanuts or peanut butter from the school.  Students with peanut allergies know they have the allergy, and they take extra precautions to prevent themselves from exposure; they avoid foods that could cause an allergic reaction.  Our students supply their own automated epinephrine injectors.  It is a prescription medication the same as insulin, cardiac, hypertensive or HIV medication.  Do airlines provide those medications?  No - passengers that take those medications have to provide their own meds for in-flight administration.  The same should apply to passengers that have known allergies that may result in anaphylaxis; they know they have the allergy and should be responsible for providing (and probably already have) their own meds to combat a severe allergic reaction.  If epinephrine is provided for people with known peanut allergies, then the airlines should be prepared to provide medication for everyone else on board that require in-flight meds.  I'm tired of the majority having to pander to the minority.  Sometimes you have to adjust when you are different from others, and I believe this is one of those times.",,,,,,,

I didn’t actually consume a peanut; I knew my allergy would initiate anaphylactic shock if I consumed peanuts, so I avoid eating them. However, they were distributed on the flight, and shortly thereafter I had an allergic reaction. I moved to the front of the cabin away from the other passengers, but my condition worsened. Upon boarding, I was forced to check my carry-on (which contained my prescribed epinephrine injector) because of lack of space in the overhead compartment. I notified the flight attendant, who told me about an epinephrine injector within the plane’s emergency kit, although she stated she could not access it without a medical professional present. After asking passengers for a medical professional to no avail, and in seeing my condition, she told me of the kit’s location, whereby I administered the medication. The plane was then grounded and I was transported to an ER.

On another flight, grounded on the runway, I watched as a woman went into severe anaphylaxis from eating a bag of pretzels manufactured in a facility that handled peanuts. The flight staff was utterly unprepared to respond, and only called 911 after the woman’s husband, a passenger/doctor, and I confronted a flight attendant and explained the severity of the issue.

There are many foods not known to cause severe allergic reactions to serve customers. It should not be permissible to knowingly introduce a known hazard within the confines of an airplane. Should airlines release bees on an airplane, or construct the seats from cloth made of poison ivy? No, because they could harm or kill passengers, without passengers eating them. So can food allergens that cause anaphylaxis.",,,,,,,

Some individuals have airborne reactions while others do not. In a closed vessel like an air craft, it would be best to ere on the side of caution and not have the allergen around at all. I think it might be helpful to seek advise from an allergist who can best tell what typical reactions might be. My understanding is that reactions can vary so an individual with a peanut allergy needs to ALWAYS be prepared with their epi-pens.  If you limit the changes to no peanuts/products on certain flights and not others, the aircrafts would need to be washed down EVERY time the plane boarded passengers to avoid cross contamination of the allergen. This is unlikely as well as not being cost efficient or realistic.  I think it is best to across the board, remove peanuts and peanut products from all flights and fine anyone who is willing to challenge the ban.

(I'm told by my children's allergist that this allergy is not hereditary, though both of my children have it, ironically.) 

I find it careless and reckless that airlines still serve peanuts - or nuts of any kind for that matter (due to cross-contamination in processing plants), on board.  Not only do passengers eat them, but they handle trays, their seats, seatbelts, door handles, countertops, and also breath the limited air which is circulated and recirculated for everyone else to breath. People with varying levels of peanut allergies are exposed to great risk when peanuts are present on board airlines whether served or allowed for passengers to bring on board.

If airlines care about the safety and wellbeing of all of their passengers, including those with peanut allergies, they should make peanut products unavailable and ask passengers not to bring them onboard with them.  There should be no ambiguity -- this should apply to all flights to save confusion - and to help save lives.

Although I carry two Epi-pens, they are only a temporary measure in an enclosed airplane at 30,000 feet. I have been on air carriers that are very accommodating, and others that aren’t. For one flight, a ‘peanut free zone’ of three aisles around my seat still caused me to break out in hives, a precursor to anaphylaxis. Luckily, we landed before my reaction got worse. Another air carrier was gracious enough to have the boarding agent announce that someone flying had a peanut allergy, and if anyone had any peanut products to please not bring them out on the plane.  As a private citizen who is not influenced by any special interest group, I am requesting that peanuts be banned from commercial air travel so that those of us with this life-threatening allergy won’t have the fear of dying just because we had to go on a business trip or wanted to visit our loved ones.",,,,,,,

I am so baffled by the fact that we put the monetary gain of an industry (i.e., Peanut) over the safety of millions of people that fly (Yes, MILLIONS of people have peanut allergies). Why do we put them above the actual customers? People can surely go hours without eating peanuts, correct?

I am particularly concerned with this wording:
""The language in the 2000 DOT appropriations act is unique. It specifies that no federal money can be used to ban peanuts or require a peanut-free buffer zone in any air carrier until at least 90 days after Congress and the DOT receive a peer-reviewed scientific study that determines peanut allergy sufferers can get a severe reaction on an airplane.""

We must prove that people can have a reaction on a plane where peanuts are served and until there is research showing this, we do nothing? That's like saying there is no proof that parachutes save lives when jumping out of airplanes. Are we supposed to do a double-blind study? 

When can we just put the safety of people above the peanut industry? If you really want to support that industry, put that money into research to get rid of peanut allergies. This would create many more future customers for them. Until then, people can live without peanuts for the duration of their flight!

Please, reconsider this and stop being bullied by industry.",,,,,,,

Not being a medical professional I can't say what the precedence is for this but I do know that the schools don't have a ban on peanuts.  Children who are in school have potentially the same exposure level given that they are also enclosed spaces since they are airconditioned and heated year round and windows are rarely opened to limit the impact of seasonal allergies.

Also, would this ban mean that airports would have to stop selling peanuts, peanut filled candy, any food that was processed in a plant that also processes nuts to prevent passengers from bringing them onto the plane? What of the residue that may be on the clothes of other passengers who ate peanuts prior to arriving at the airport? And, would all vending machines that kids have access to have to stop selling peanut candy too?

Our kids spend a lot of their time at school, camps and other enclosed spaces. When the schools ban peanuts, then perhaps there will be a sronger argument for banning peanuts on planes.",,,,,,,

It would be a simple fix---just remove the tiny packages of peanuts from the airlines.  I highly doubt anyone would truly miss them.

It is very likely that people with severe peanut allergy will suffer and adverse/life threatening reaction just from airborne and/or tactile contact.

Yes, each individual should carry all necessary medications on the plane.  Be advise that if an anaphylactic reaction should occur, medical intervention must be immediately sought.  The individual must arrive at a hospital within 20-30 minutes for treatment.  The epi-pen only lasts for about 20 minutes and that is why the individual must make it to a hospital in a matter of minutes.  If they do not the reaction progresses faster and faster.  IV lines must be started to secure the airway.

Any items with acutal peanuts in it should be banned for the safety of these individuals.

1.  It will give those with allergies a false sense of security.  Even if the airlines not longer distribute peanuts on a plane; peanuts may still find their way onboard.  I can still bring trail mix or Peanut M&Ms on the flight and therefore those wit allergies are at risk.  So, unless you want to ban all peanuts from being brought on board, this rule would only stand to give those with allergies a false sense of security.
2.  This will be a slippery slope.  My wife is allergic to milk and citrus fruits.  Does this mean airlines should no longer serve milk with coffee or juice during the beverage service on a flight?  Should we stop servicing bread products because folks might have a gluten allergy? No.  It is too much.
3.  Those with the allergies can control the effects of their allergies.  If they have a reaction, they can give themselves an injection of epinephrine.  They can also use a respirator or mask of they are afraid of airborne particles.
4.  This ban on peanut allergies is going too far.  For instance, peanut products are now banned in most schools.  Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches were at one point a lunchtime staple.  Peanut butter is an inexpensive protein-rich food one could give their child.  Now it is banned because, out of the blue over the past few years, people with allergies are coming out of the woodwork.


In response to some questions:
A peanut buffer zone is not the answer.  Are you going to tell people that if you are within 4 rows of someone with a peanut allergy you cannot have peanuts while your fellow passengers, who paid the same fare, can have peanuts?  This is ludicrous and also very difficult to implement… particularly without singling out the individual with the allergy.",,,,,,,

Banning peanuts may only serve to make things worse for people who suffer additional allergies (i.e., substituting peanuts with another snack, i.e., sesame, which more individuals are becoming allergic to).  As a relative of someone with severe food allergies, the best method is individual responsibility.  For those underage, it falls to their caretaker/guardian/parent by again making the physical environment peanut free (wipes, etc.) and by carrying an Epi-Pen.  I believe flight attendants should be knowledgeable in the administration of an Epi-Pen.  Banning a food, any food, is not the answer.  I cannot imagine it would be possible to police every individual who boards a flight to see if he/she is carrying peanuts -- or eaten some before boarding.  Reasonableness should prevail.

Our daughter was diagnosed with a peanut and nut alergy after her consumption of 3 peanuts at 18 months old.  We never knew or understood the gravity of the situation until we experienced it with our own eyes.

With all due respect, it would be a terrifing not to mention emotionally devastaing for the child to accidentally come in contact with peanuts and suffocate to death in the plane, due to anaphalactic shock after being in contact with a peanut, epi-pens are only effective for 30 minutes to allow the affefct person to get to the hospital and be treated, having a person go into anaphalactic shock in the air in beyond frighning.  This can all be avoided by banning peanuts from the airplanes, or at least, while there is a peanut allergergic person on board. 

I don't understand the politics behind the peanut, I understand they are delicious, nutricious, affordable and practical, bue to an allergic person is potential fatal.

There are many other snacks that can be served in lieu of peanuts, I think this is no brainer, even if my daughter was not affected, I would be sympathetic for others.

Keep in mind, that many people are not aware of the potential fatal outcome of this allergy, many think is a minor rash or equivalent, believe me, it is NOT.

Have some benevolence regarding people with peanut and nut allergies onboard a plane.  This is like playing with a loaded gun.

Flying is always nervewracking. While an epipen can reverse an allergic reaction, it is a severe medicine to use, and I wouldn't want to use it on a flight. Its use requires immediate medical attention and could force an earlier landing, inconveniencing all passengers more than the remove of nuts from planes. While my child's allergy is not airborne, just touching nut residue left by an earlier passenger and then putting her hands in her mouth could be enough to cause a reaction. We never fly any airlines that do not create nut-free zones, but it still causes undue panic in a child to know she is ""trapped"" on a plane and could be exposed to nuts. I know of an individual who went into anaphylactic shock from airborne nuts after the airline refused to ban them on her flight, and the plane had to make an emergency landing. Surely, in addition to the emotional toll on those severely allergic to nuts, their presence on flights is not worth delays in arriving at passengers' destinations on time. For many people, this is not just an inconvenience but a life-threatening allergy that needs to be addressed by a catch-all government rule and not left to the whims of individual airlines and, more specifically, individual flight crews, who do not deal with the allergy in a uniform way.

Please be aware of the urgency of my request -- my son Hunter is 8 years old and has experienced a life threatening peanut reaction when exposed to peanuts being shelled at his little league game.  Not only was his respiratory system involved in this reaction.  Nausea and debilitating muscle and joint pain occurred for one week after his exposure to dust sized particles of a peanut shell while OUTDOORS.

The next reaction to inhaled peanut contaminants was in December of 2009 -- one of his classmates was eating a peanut butter sandwich at the cafeteria table next to his own.  The result was respiratory distress, nausea, vomitting and debilitating muscle and joint pain for at least one week after his exposure.

This same incident occured in the classroom when a bag of peanuts was opened -- he vomitted repeatedly -- and joint pain ensued.

My pediatric pulmonologist Bhimsen Rao of Shelby Township Michigan confirms that peanuts most certainly can cause death when inhaled by those who have adverse reactions.  He in fact knows of a young woman who died when inhaling peanut oil from the air of a home she was visiting.

Although there are not many doctors who have known cases such as ours.  It is vital that situations like ours are not overlooked.  How can my son and daughter who also has peanut allergies safely travel if there is not an option for making a flight peanut free?

consider the season allergies that many suffer each year.  If a tree can create pollen and affect a person 20 miles away via airborne inhalation, why would we doubt that peanuts in a closed airplane when inhaled by those allergic could cause life threatening situation?

Second, there is the issue of cross-contamination of the tray. It is common for passengers to let the pretzels sit on the tray while they are eating-if my gluten free food (or my children's) then touches the tray we can get very ill-not what you want on a plane!

However, if the passenger tries to change their ticket or flight we are hit with extreme penalties, which are typically $50 to $200 ticket change charges and a repricing of the ticket.

This is not fair, and it's time for a change!  If the airline changes our flights, then passengers should be compensated the same as when the airline charges us for our changes.

My son has a severe peanut allergy & has had respiratory reactions on a flight that we were initially told was peanut-free; the airline served peanuts anyway. He has also reacted to someone eating a peanut butter sandwich 3 rows away. Fellow passengers have shown support & empathy; we have never had a fellow passenger complain. I would hope anyone witnessing anaphylactic shock would forego peanuts for a few hours.
We take responsibility for our son's health, & take the following precautions:
*carry Epi-pens & Benadryl with us
*notify the airline when making our reservation
*notify the gate agent upon arrival
*notify the flight attendats upon boarding
*pre-board & wipe down seats, armrests, tray tables
*use wipes on bathroom door handles, overhead bin handles
*carry medical & insurance information in case of an emergency
*bring our own snacks/food
We only fly Southwest whenever possible, as they gladly refrain from serving peanuts when notified. We were recently told peanuts cost them much more than other snacks; when there are other snacks available (pretzels, crackers), it is not an imposition on them or other passengers in the least to preserve life, which is why they gladly comply with requests by passengers for peanut-free flights. 
Specific comments requested by DOT:
* buffer zones for airline-provided service alone are completely ineffectual because the air is recirculated; realizing no one can control what passengers bring on, a buffer zone would be appreciated to mitigate that exposure (i.e. a child in the seat behind us with a peanut butter sandwich grabbing/touching our seatback)
*peanut-free flights are a great compromise, with the added precautions noted above that we take, & the buffer zone as described
*a peanut ban would be feasible since other snacks are easily substituted & would serve the same primary purpose of a snack
I also believe Epi-pens and Benadryl should be included in all plane medical kits",,,,,,,

Even though we informed the airline of our son's allergy and they created a ""buffer zone"" around us on all our flights, we saw to our horror that all of the areas between the aisle and seats, where there is a small groove in the floor, were littered with fragments of peanuts.

It is important that not only do airlines not serve the peanuts, but to make sure all airlines are peanut-free meaning nobody can bring their own peanuts on the flight. Peanut allergies can be airborne fromt he dust of a peanut shell, which can float throughout the cabin and be left on seat cushions and armrests from previous flights. My daughter had a reaction at a baseball game after just sitting in a chair that had peanut dust on it, nobody around us was eating any peanuts at the time. I'm sure there will be complaints from a small minority of people. However, as with any previous airline travel changes that may have seemed like an inconvenience at first, have become a normal of travel. Non-smoking flights, taking off shoes at passenger screening points, liquids in small tubes and plastic bags, etc. These changes all were met with some objection at first, but it is ultimately for the safety and comfort of the passengers. Believe me that when a plane has to make an emergency landing for a medical emergency due to passenger not breathing because of their peanut allergy reaction, it will be a bigger inconvenience than not packing that bag of peanuts the morning of their flight.",,,,,,,

I realize and regret the inconvience. But keep in mind the extrarodinary inconvience of living with food allergies. Missing peanuts for a few hours is hardly a traumatic event. While, undergoing anaphylaxis is.

My child is severely allergic to peanuts and when I took her on a ""no peanut"" flight, after being assured that the plane had been specially cleaned and no peanuts would be served.  As soon as we sat down, we saw there were peanuts on the floor of the plane, directly in front of us.  My child is not affected by airborne particles (yet), but for someone that is, this would have been immediately life-threatening.  The effects of an Epi-pen last approximately 15 minutes.  If someone has a severe reaction in the air, do you think it is possible to land the plane and have that person receive life-saving medical attention within those 15 minutes?  Many people carry double doses, in case of a delay in receiving medical care, but landing a plane in 30 minutes and getting that person to a hospital would be difficult to say the least.  
There is no such thing as a ""buffer zone"" for someone who reacts to airborne particles, especially in a sealed airplane.  The argument against the ban tends to be that only a few people are affected.  These ""few people"" are in danger of losing their lives, though.  You do not allow people to carry a gun on the plane due to the danger.  Peanuts are just as dangerous as a gun to someone with this condition and there will be many more people with this condition for years to come.  
Food allergies are an exponentially increasing condition in the U.S.  Millions of Americans everyday live with food allergies that dramatically alter their way of life.  Food allergies are a disability and people who suffer with them should not be discriminated against by anyone.  Banning peanuts will initally cause some grumbling, as did the ban of smoking, but the benefits far outweigh the grumbling.",,,,,,,

My 4 year old has anaphylaxed to peanuts that she was exposed to in the air and also from peanut residue that was left on couches.  This experience would lead me to strongly urge you to consider banning peanuts on all flights, not only those with the peanut allergic passenger.  Passengers consuming peanuts on a previous flight could leave peanut residue on the seats which could then expose a severely allergic passenger on the next flight.

While epinephrine is life saving, and does work quickly to halt the allergic response, it is not always the end treatment for a severe allergic reaction.   After administering an epi pen a person in anaphylaxis may only have 15 minutes to reach a hospital, I believe this would be incredibly difficult to do during a flight.  In the absence of prompt medical attention an anaphylactic reaction can result in death.  

Most people with food allergies, or parents of children with food allergies would agree that it is their responsibility to carry an epi pen at all times.  However, there are a number of people who anaphylax without prior knowledge of having a food allergy.  In these instances, it would be imperative to have epinephrine available.  Airlines should be required to have epi pens on board in both adult and jr doses.  It is a simple and relatively inexpensive life saving device to have on board.  

Again, thank you for considering a peanut ban on flights.  This could be a life saving change and will allow a number of peanut allergic people to fly again.

Some people with these allergies are contact sensitive and need not even ingest the peanuts to get a severe reaction so eliminating it as much as possible would help insure a safe flight.

As a mom of a child with a serious peanut allergy it would be a major relief and would have a huge positive life changing impact on us if we could request a peanut free flight upon providing medical proof that our son has a serious peanut allergy.  Presently we can fly very few airlines and even those are inconsistent with how they will handle our situation.  Recently we had to take four flights to reach our destination.  Not a single passenger complained, but some of the flight attendants denied printed material from their airline and would not carry through with what the airline had stated.    Flying should not be a potentially life threatening situation on an otherwise normal flight.  We do our part by contacting the airlines well ahead of time, bringing needed medications with notes from doctors insuring it is needed, plus packing safe food for the duration of the journey.  We wipe down our seats, trays, walls, arm rests, etc.  It is still risky for us to fly and we are at the complete mercy of others.  Having guidelines for all airlines in place that are consistent would be tremendously helpful.  Below are listed some situations we ran into on our last trip.  Thank you for addressing the situation.
Sincerely, R Van Duren

 One flight attendant wanted our son to wear a surgical mask even though he was frightened to be flying aside from his allergies.  There is no evidence that wearing a mask would prevent a reaction.  It just increased his fear.  Although goodwill announcements were made and adhered to by all, at least two of the announcements were not made until we reached cruising altitude.  People begin eating as soon as they boarded the plane.  The first 30 or so minutes on board were extremely uncomfortable since we had no way of knowing what was being consumed around us.  If it contained peanuts we would not know until it was too late.  It is extremely uncomfortable and intimidating to have to approach a complete strange",,,,,,,

I was diagnosed with a peanut allergy at the age of 12, which has increased with severity over the years, and has since nearly killed me.  My reaction to peanut protein/dust is so severe that anaphylaxis is always a concern.  Anaphylaxis includes throat closure and the loss of organ functions.  Due to the severity, I take precautions to avoid and reduce my risk of exposure.  I avoid situations such as sporting events where I know peanuts will be present.  I also remove myself from situations where peanuts are found.  I carry four prescription medications including Epinephrine pens with me at all times.  

The main problem with this allergy is that I love to travel, and often need to travel to conferences out of state.  My main choice of travel is by car, but sometimes that is not an option due to the distance or time it would take.  

Each and every time I decide to board a plane (which is very rare) I am putting my life in the hands of flight attendants and fellow passengers that are generally uneducated to this health risks involved.  I begin my flight by taking two medications as a precaution to any peanut dust that may be left from previous passengers.  I wear long sleeves and cover as much skin as possible.  I wear rubber gloves and wipe down seats with Clorox Wipes.  Unfortunately when you are 30,000 feet in the air the only way to remove yourself from the situation of peanut dust exposure would involve illegally opening the cabin door and jumping out.  Staying on a plane where others are consuming peanuts could lead to the same outcome as jumping out of the plane for me- death.

It is equally scary for my teenage daughter as she suspiciously eyes other passengers in fear that they may open trail mix or peanut butter crackers nearby.  She knows as well as I do that if the anaphylaxis starts she must inject me with the Epinephrine and hope the pilot makes an emergency landing.

The fears and risk could be avoided if Congress would ban peanuts!",,,,,,,

At this point, he cannot fly on a commercial flight due to the fact that someone may be eating nuts on the flight and he could have an anaplyatic reaction.  It is very hard for the crew to clean the flight in between flights- they would need to vacuum the seats and wash the ""arms"" of the chairs with soap and water to remove the peanut protein that causes the reaction.  Why allow a food that could cause death to someone (in our case a child) in the air.  Wouldn't you rather let the child and adult who are allergic to peanuts fly worry free.   Our son would have thirty minutes to get to an ER.   The first epi-pen provides 15 minutes of relief and the second provides another 15.

Dr. Scott Sicherer is a food allergy researcher in New York.  He would provide excellent and accurate recommendations regarding the actual and probable risk to peanut allergic passengers exposed to peanuts (airborne) enclosed in an airplane.  He has performed studies examining airborne risk in confined spaces.

As a mother of a child with a severe food allergy (not peanut), I do applaud your decision to seriously consider adopting policies to keep individuals with peanut allergies safe.  With the multitude of food choices that we have in the United States, the mere banning of peanut products for a flight may be a life saving measure for certain individuals.  Just the anxiety of not knowing whether a young child would come in contact wtih peanuts on the floor etc could cause a family to choose not to fly.  

Even with the availability of epinephrine readily accessible, an immediate visit to the emergency room is mandatory with a reaction.  When in flight, this is an impossibility.

There are individuals that do not wish to have any of their individual liberties limited.  (Like mothers that insist that their children should be allowed to bring peanut butter sandwiches to elementary school when there are young children with severe peanut allergies in their child's classroom.)  However, just as there are rules in society to protect individuals, I believe that setting rules based on current scientific knowledge would be a benefit to all individuals.  

If you could potentially prevent even one fatal reaction, wouldn't that be worth it?  Prevention is the key.

We fly to Italy once a year with our daughter who has gone into anaphylactic shock. Before boarding we distribute laminated cards in English and Italian that read, ""Dear Passenger: Our daughter Giada has a life threatening allergy to peanuts. Any exposure to peanuts could cause her to have an anaphylactic attack. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that would require she be hospitalized within 15 minutes. If she is not treated immediately, the reaction will be fatal. We would like to ask you to please refrain from eating any peanut snacks during this flight.

We have been met with nothing short of sincere thanks for informing them and compassion.  I've had people throw away their entire sandwiches after reading our note. Banning a potentially fatal element from flights seems like a logical solution. When weighing out the pros and cons one must ask what the objective of a flight is.

The government over regulates it's citizens on the small stuff while avoiding larger issues.  Maybe after this the DOT could look into the lack of on-time flights or possibly the crazy fees we are subjected to when we fly.",,,,,,,

I would like to comment on the approaches to provide greater access to air transportation to persons with peanut allergies.

My Son has multiple food allergies.  He also suffers from ""contact reactiveness""  -- meaning if a person eats a peanut and then puts their hand on the tray table or the side arm of the chair and left a trace of the peanut on there -- then my son is the next person to sit there -- if my son touches where the peanut residue is left behind he will have an allergic reaction.

Every time my son has an allergic reaction, his body actually grows more allergic to the offending food.  One would think that his body would grow more de-sensitized to the food but it is actually the opposite.  It is much like someone who is allergic to bees and after being stung several times over a period of years the allergic reaction grows more and more deadly.

So my concern for my Son is two-fold.  The immediate reaction and the long-term reaction, both of which could ultimately result in his Death. Both which could be avoided if the serving of peanuts and all peanut products was banned by both U.S. and foreign carriers on flights covered by DOT's disability rule.

I appreciate your time in reading my comment.  I hope that one day Airline Flights will be peanut free.

Peanuts should be banned from airline flights simply based on the fast that EPI-pens, while efficient at suppressing reactions temporarily... are not a solution to the problem.  They are merely a time-buying agent.

What should be law is that pilots should be required to announce the presence on board of passengers with nut allergies, so that decent people could decide to abstain from eating loose nuts, and those with known food allergies should be banned from eating airline food.

Peanuts are responsible for the most severe allergic reactions of the ""top 8"" allergens, and time-critical treatment must be administered.  Just because there hasn't been a tragic recent news story about a peanut-allergy fatality in the air, this could be just the result of families self-selecting to avoid air travel because of the risks of exposure to a life-threatening item.  

To provide any of the other, less-stringent, options to limit peanuts would be impractical, if not impossible to provide.  Planes would need to be cleaned thoroughly in the middle of the day if a nut-free flight was requested.  Providing a ""buffer zone"" of a few rows does nothing on longer or international flights where the passenger must get up to use the restroom, thereby leaving the ""clean"" area.

We need to look beyond the tradition of serving peanuts on planes and see the reality that many more children are allergic to peanuts.  It is not a ""Nanny State"" issue, but a medical and health condition (just as smoking was banned on the whole plane for the same reason!).  Other passengers will not die from not eating a peanut product on a flight, but the large number of children and adults who are allergic can die from accidentally ingesting a nut, breathing particles, or getting peanut oil on their fingers and then in their mouth while eating the ""safe"" pretzels.

A full ban on peanuts is the safest, most responsible option.  All the families that currently avoid air travel would then be able to fly.   Non-allergic passengers would not be inconvenienced.  The rule would be consistent (all flights) and allergic passengers would be safer. 

Peanuts are not necessary on flights.  Please allow all passengers to travel without fear for their safety from the food served on planes.",,,,,,,

I don't think that airlines have accurate data on how many people are affected because passengers don't always share what has happened - in this case, the parents did not tell the flight attendants because 1. it was too late to for them to do anything about the peanuts and 2. the father is an anesthesiologist and better equipped than the plane staff to handle the emergency. My feeling has always been, even before my niece was born, that there is no need to serve peanuts on flights when this can be life-threatening or traumatic to passengers with peanut allergies, and when there are substitutes that will not have the same effect. I have never heard of anyone having a reaction to pretzel dust. Nobody is going to suffer if peanuts are not served, but some will and do if they are. Those who argue otherwise, in my opinion, show a lack of tolerance and empathy towards others. The ""well then they shouldn't fly"" argument is irrational - someone who is allergic to peanuts should never have the opportunity to travel by plane?

With regard to the topic and contents of section 12, I submit the following two points:

Due to the narrow-minded and provincial limits imposed by congress on the guidance letter issued by the DOT on the subject of peanut-free air travel, airline travel is not an option for my family at this time. As the parent of a severely peanut-allergic child, I always carry an epinephrine autoinjector and would do so in an airline environment if I were comfortable with the steps taken by airlines in providing a safe environment for my child. The protection offered by a dual-dose epinephrine autoinjector allows for an estimated maximum of 40 minutes of treatment for an anaphylactic reaction to exposure to an allergen. I believe it is impossible for a commercial airline to react swiftly enough to secure proper (on ground) continuing treatment within this time frame. 

Reasonable limitation of the presence of peanuts in an airline environment can be ensured via the prohibition of any products containing peanut ingredients as an allergen per the FDA-approved labeling laws. This would include any peanut allergen, regardless of its form. This guideline would serve to simplify the rules based on preexisting guidelines.

In conclusion, the presence of peanuts in the airline environment effectively prohibits peanut-allergic individuals from traveling safely. Regardless of the specific number or likelihood of incidents, a relatively simple procedural change will allow for these individuals to rely on the system to provide a safe environment per 14 CFR part 382 of the ACAA.",,,,,,,

Were there to be a ban in place, I would be more inclined to fly a variety of airlines, thus spreading my consumer dollar beyond one or two preferred airlines as I now do. The responsibility to keep my son safe is mine. But as soon as the aircraft door is closed, my abilities to do so are limited by circumstance. Namely, being 30,000 feet in the air and at least 60 minutes from emergency medical care, makes it treacherous no matter what I do.

There are numerous conditions that can be exacerbated by airline travel. I know that many older persons, particularly women, are at risk of blood clots because of dangerously cramped conditions, and cannot fly long distances. I have personally become ill numerous times because obviously sick passengers have been allowed to board. I contracted H1N1 virus in this manner. An immunosuppressed person could not travel in these conditions. Why favor those with an autoimmune reaction by banning peanuts and discriminate against other conditions affecting larger portions of the population?
Secondly, as airlines are scaling back on food service options and charging high prices for meals that had once been free, a snack choice that is low in sugar but contains vitamins and protein is a good choice. Along with protein, serving of peanuts contains more calories than a serving of pretzels, which is a welcome boost to busy and tired travelers. 
Each and every person has specific needs and limitations. The way that most of us handle them is to cope! If parents are concerned for the safety of their allergic children, they should have them wear a surgical mask for the duration of the flight.",,,,,,,

Banning the serving of peanuts and all peanut products by both U.S. and foreign carriers on flights covered by DOT's disability rule.

My son has a life threatening peanut allergy.  He is contact reactive to peanuts, meaning that simply touching peanut will put him into anaphylactic shock.  While we are teaching him to live in this society that is inherently dangerous for him, airplanes provide a particular safety concern since a reaction could occur at 30,000 feet, without access to adequate medical facilities.

Any person who uses an Epipen should seek medical attention immediately. The effects of the epinephrine only last 20 minutes and second reactions are common.

For the contact reactive, your 2nd proposal does not eliminate his risk because any peanuts on a previous flight are a threat.  All it takes is for someone to have a peanut and touch something heends up touching on a later flight - he'll react.

In response to specific questions:
* The allergic individual should be responsible for carrying their own medications.
* You distinguish between airborne particles and ingesting/eating the peanut.  But as I've mentioned above, there are also contact reactive individuals.  They may not be sensitive to airborne particles, but they will react if touched.  Don't forget this important group.  I suspect they are more common than the person who responds to airborne allergens.
* Simply preparing for a flight by bringing meds does not help the peanut allergic.  It does nothing to reduce the likelihood of a reaction.  It simply provides a very temporary fix if there is a reaction.
* Flights should be declared peanut free and passengers should be asked not to bring peanuts.  Flight attendants should take them if they do come on board and appropriate cleaning procedures should be implemented.
* Include any food containing a peanut product.  Peanut oil is less of a problem.",,,,,,,

In all sincerity, having lived with a child who has a life threatening reaction to peanuts (among other foods), traveling for us is almost impossible.  And quite honestly, I don't think people flying really care what kind of snack they get - as long as they get something.  What many people don't realize is that even if you attempt to keep the flight or immediate area peanut free, the peanut proteins can remain on the seats, arm rests, trays etc. and this is a potential life or death situation for many, many people.  Anyone who has anaphylaxis to peanuts requires only a minute exposure to the proteins before symptoms begin.  And once they begin, it can be literally seconds before immediate distress.

For those who are misinformed about how peanut sensitivity affects sufferers, here’s what happens when allergic persons come into contact with peanuts. For starters, peanut allergic persons know better than to eat this allergen.  However, there are many whose sensitivity is so heightened that they can’t inhale or touch peanut dust. When you can’t see the allergen, it’s hard to avoid. Aboard a plane, it’s impossible to know who has brought peanuts aboard until the allergic person begins to react. For many allergic people, what begins as hives and mild discomfort can and usually does escalate to a full anaphylactic reaction if they are not removed from the site of the exposure and treated. If you’ve been around someone who is in full anaphylaxis, you’d know better than to pass it off as something trivial. Picture a person swelling up, turning brick red, vomiting and chocking on his own vomit because he can’t breathe. That’s pretty much what anaphylaxis looks like. What follows, sometimes even after the administration of epinephrine, is shock and death. Our flying experience with our peanut allergic child has been so stressful that we drive everywhere. When forced to fly, we carry masks, wipes, and multiple Epis.  Our child had massive hives and throat tightening on a Delta Flight from peanut dust settling on his seat. If wasn’t for the ER physician on board, it could have turned out badly for him We’ve had to educate fellow passengers about the potential dangers of eating nuts, especially peanuts, on board. Every one of them has been willing to comply and have even thanked us for educating them. NOBODY wants to be responsible for causing an allergic reaction or death of a fellow passenger.

Please eliminate peanuts on airplanes!  According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, peanut allergies are the most prevalent food allergy in the US, with as many as 1.5 million people suffering from the disease.  An allergic reaction to peanuts is responsible for 15,000 emergency room visits every year and is the most common cause of food related death .  
 My three year old is allergic to peanuts and traveling by airplane is terrifying!  In February we were flying from Michigan to Florida on Northwest Airlines.   We notified the airlines in advance about the allergy and they said they would provide a three row ""buffer"" during the flight where peanuts would not be served.  When we got on the plane, we reminded the flight attendants and they agreed to enforce the three row buffer.   When we walked back to our seats however, there was a peanut  on my son's seat from the previous flight, as well as several peanuts on the floor.
Although my son's allergy is not airborne, he does not need to actually ingest peanuts to have a reaction, he just needs to touch it.  This means that if the person sitting on the flight prior to him ate peanuts then touched the armrest or tray table, my son could have a reaction from touching the same item.  This is also true for the bathrooms on the plane.  If someone ate peanuts and then went to the bathroom, when they opened the door or turned on the water, they would leave behind peanut oil that could send my child into anaphylactic shock.  Although we wiped down every surface he might possibly touch, the flight was still nerve-racking.  We carry an epi-pen but in the case of an anaphylactic emergency, the epi-pen would only buy us about 20 minutes of time before he needed medical treatment.  
With the severity of peanut allergies and so many other snack options available, it just doesn't make sense to serve peanuts on airplanes.  
Thank you for your consideration.

Peanut Allergies.

I can only speak on the behalf of my daughter that has a severe peanut allergy.  

A few things many do not understand about severe peanut allergies.  Any contact to peanuts in any amount can be fatal.  And does not require the person to ingest it. 

If a person eats peanuts in a seat that later is occupied by someone with an allergy it is very likely that the allergic person will have a reaction.  

If peanuts were banned from flights completely that would provide the safest alternative.  Items or food that ""may contain"" or "" are processed on shared equipment"" I consider safe to be near her although she can not eat it  Anything that ""contains"" peanut in any form presents a risk.

We have only flown once with her.  We called the airline in advance, provided Dr notes and was assured that the airline policy was one that no peanuts would be served on the flight and that they would even make an announcement asking passengers to refrain from eating peanuts.  Once we arrived at the gate things were different.  We were told to just not let her eat anything.  That they had no control over what food or snack was served.  We made the round trip flight with no problems thankfully.  but will not be flying again anytime soon.  In fact for vacation this year we rented an RV.

The bottom line is that it is a matter of life and death in some cases and not a matter of convenience or comfort.

There is no additional ""cost"" or ""hardship"" on the behalf of the airline.  It's simply a choice to serve pretzels or assorted chips instead or peanuts.  Imagine the cost if an emergency landing was required to save the life of someone in anaphylaxis shock.  Imagine the cost if the life couldn't be saved",,,,,,,

I think my greatest concern with peanuts on a plane is the chance of reaction and the fact that you can't leave the plane and you can't get to a hospital. I think it would be great if there were no peanuts on planes at all. The incidence of peanut allergy is increasing and peanut allergy is the most likely to cause a fatal reaction. People are very charitable today, giving to so many causes - I would think peanuts on a flight would be a small thing to ask someone to give up.",,,,,,,

The first and second options are the only reasonable options.  My family has taken numerous trips to Colorado/Utah and Florida and have experienced all three options.  The first two options create the least controversy among passengers because the food options to all passengers are equal – no peanut products are served.

(1) 	Banning the serving of peanuts and all peanut products by both U.S. and foreign carriers on flights covered by DOT's disability rule; 
(2) 	Banning the serving of peanuts and all peanut products on all such flights where a passenger with a peanut allergy is on board and has requested a peanut-free flight in 
advance; 

If no peanut products are offered, the passengers will accept and select the offered products.

In 2003, my family was subject to the third option.  

(3) 	Requiring a peanut-free buffer zone in the immediate area of a passenger with a medically-documented severe allergy to peanuts if passenger has requested a peanut-free flight in advance. 

In 2003, the stewards informed passengers in my family’s buffered area they were unable to receive peanut products.  Those peanut-loving passengers created a ruckus by screaming their rights to eat peanut products were compromised based exclusively on their bad luck in sitting near us.  Those peanut-loving passengers were moved and while moving they attempted to intimidate my family.  For that reason the first and second options – which creates a uniform environment – is the only reasonable option to decrease airline passenger problems.

As for the peanut industry’s comments, they caused the problem.  Since the 1960’s the peanut industry has genetically altered, through numerous methods including and not limited to cross-breeding, its peanuts to render them less prone to fungus, water rot, and other undesirable diseases or equivalents thereof that damage and therefore lessen its crop yield.  There is a plethora of scientific articles that confirm gen",,,,,,,

The flight attendants have varied in the way they respond to his allergy in that some have announced that no peanuts will be served on the plane, and others have simply observed the ""no peanuts three rows ahead or behind of the peanut allergic passenger"".  We have, however, found peanuts on the seats or the floor around him when we boarded the plane.  We simply take the time to look around and then wipe down the tray table and the actual seat with some type of disinfecting wipe.  It would make it less stressful to travel with him if peanuts (or all nuts) were simply not offered on the flight.  I realize that this may seem extreme to some people, but I would think that it would also make it easier for the flight attendants to have one less thing to worry about.

He has flown once as a toddler before we knew of his allergies. I fear getting him back on an airplane for his safety, and his precious life knowing peanuts may be present.  While it is unlikely an airborne incident could result in a serious reaction, it is NOT WORTH the risk. How could anyone tell me that my son's precious life is worth the risk, for them to have the convenience of eating peanuts on a flight.  I think an alternative snack should be available like pretzels and no nuts should be allowed on planes. Accidents happen, people get confused, what if an attendant touched some peanuts cleaning up a spill, then touches a bottle of water for my son and he has a reaction?   What if he had a terrible reaction on a plane and we needed emergency help from an ER? We always carry epi pens, but sometimes they are not enough - what if he had serious respiratory issues and needed to be in an ER? It is not worth this risk.  Please consider an alertnative  snack product for all airplanes.  I am sorry if it is an inconvenience to some people and they prefer peanuts, but how can anyone say it is worth risking a child's life?  People can get peanuts before or after their flight if it is that important.  Peanut allergies are too prevalent today to ignore and they continue to increase.

My child is among many who suffer from life threatening peanut allergies and we welcome the opportunity to comment.  When we travel via plane, besides having to bring our own ""safe"" meals and snacks from home, we have to take precautions such as wiping down the seat and surrounding areas and/or covering the seat with our own covers from home.  In addition, we always register with the attendants as requiring peanut-free surroundings, and we have received mixed responses to that request.  In the best situation, the flight attendant announces the allergy and that all passengers should refrain from eating any peanut products.  In the worst case, there was nothing done at all because there are no laws on record.  On a long international flight, I once took six emergency epipen rescue injectors with me,fearing that my child might not be able to reach a hospital in time to be rescued.  Having laws in place would contribute to public safety.

Our preschool and local public schools have enforced a peanut ban because the administrators recognize 1) peanut allergies are the most prevalent, 2) the incidence of peanut allergies is rising, and 3) children deserve freedom from the fear of dying from exposure to peanuts.  

Please watch this heartbreaking video to see what it is like to be a kid dealing with food allergies: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8UhJXr2pXc

If questions arise regarding policing individual passengers and their reluctance to give up the freedom to eat whatever they want, I would compare this proposed rule to the banning of smoking on airplanes.  This is for the good of all passengers.  Treating someone who goes into anaphylactic shock on board an airplane due to prolonged exposure to airborne allergens, would hopefullly require an airplane to change its flight plan, affecting all passengers on board.

Although they offer many good ideas, I want to speak only to the possibility of eliminating peanuts from flights. I am not a scientist or researcher, but I do have the experience of being a mother and flying with my toddler peanut-allergic son across country. I can sum up the experience as frightening, stressful and draining. I imagine the irony is not lost on many people who deal with a peanut allergy that we willingly subject ourselves to endless screening and security checks in the airport, but an item that can just as easily hurt or kill my son is not only allowed on the plane, but offered by the airline itself.

I understand that people who do not deal with the allergy on a daily basis cannot understand what it is like to remain constantly vigilent about every ingredient of every item of food you consume, and I truly make an effort to impose on others as little as possible by always bringing food with us and ALWAYS having his benedryl and epi-pen at hand. But such precautions will not guarantee he will not have a reaction on a plane in which peanuts are served in bags that, when pulled open, can emit particles of peanut protein that is then circulated through the cabin due to recycled air. Having an in-cabin epi-pen is a wonderful idea that should be implemented, but the only way to ensure the safety of someone with an allergy is to eliminate any potential exposure. And although I remain conscious of the rights of others, I do not believe that removing tiny bags of peanuts or small packages of peanut butter crackers is going to significantly reduce a passenger's flight experience. No one books a flight solely for the cuisine.

In closing, I unfortunately cannot take this allergy away from my son or anyone else. All I can do is work to ensure others are aware of his limitations and try to create as safe an environment as possible. Your assistance in this effort would be so appreciated.",,,,,,,

The fact that a lot of airlines voluntarily do not serve peanuts makes us feel more comfortable flying.  We always check with the airlines to ensure that they still have the no peanut policy (they can't restrict what passengers are bringing on themselves, but it helps that they do not serve them to all passengers since this limits our possible exposure).

This tells me that the peanut producers have a stronger lobbing presence in congress than the health & safety advocates.  The document calls out 3 questions.  Regarding question (1) I see no reason for peanuts to be banned from all flights.  Seats and tray tables can be wiped clean with typically available cleaning wipes and that is the responsibility of the affected person to do so when they fly.  With regard to question (2) it seems reasonable that we as a nation would consider it acceptable to ban peanuts on flights where a verifiable allergic person is travelling.  After all we ban cigarette smoking and yet nobody has had an anaphylactic reaction to cigarette smoke and died on a plane.  We agreed to live with that prohibition based on long term impacts and the tobacco producers didn't go bankrupt.  Additionally if an individual needs to have a high protein, vegatable based, bagged snack they could use sunflower seeds.  With regard to question (3) a buffer zone has always worked for our family and we have found our fellow passengers to be very understanding and reasonable.  There is plenty of scientific evidence that reactions can occur by touching or ingesting peanuts to debate that questions is just wasting time and money.  In a buffer zone environment the definition of a prohibited substance could very reasonably be limited to items that state that they have actual nuts contained in them.  Insect stings as well as active ingredients in over the counter pain killers can inspire anaphylactic reactions without prior warning.  In a world where you find Defibrillation devices everywhere you go, an epi-pen is pretty cheap life saving insurance but all allergic people carry their own anyway.  This is a great opportunity for pragmatic rule making.",,,,,,,

Subject: DOT-OST-2010-0140

Date: June 30, 2010

I am writing with respect to the rights afforded to airline passengers with peanut allergies as it relates to DOT-OST-2010-0140. As an adult air traveler with a severe peanut allergy, as well as the father of a young child predisposed to the same allergy, I believe it is important for the DOT to mandate that ALL airlines discontinue serving peanuts and products in which peanuts are a core ingredient (e.g., Peanut M&M’s) on ALL airline flights regardless of whether a passenger on a specific flight has a peanut allergy. In addition, on flights that carry a person with a peanut allergy, an announcement should be made asking other passengers not to consume peanuts or products in which peanuts are a core ingredient. I believe a number of reasons exist for a full ban on peanuts (which I address in the attached document).

1. Accordingly to numerous sources, peanuts are the leading cause of food-related death in the US. In addition, relative to other food allergies, peanut allergies tend to be more severe.

2. It is impractical to service and clean an aircraft between legs or connections, and a passenger with a peanut allergy can be affected by whatever is served on the aircraft before he or she boards his or her flight.

3. A buffer zone is insufficient to deal with potential airborne allergens in an enclosed cabin environment with re-circulated air.

4. The airline industry’s technology is antiquated and does not allow for customer profiles to reflect peanut allergies to properly regulate the distribution of peanuts on aircraft ahead of time.

5. There appears to be no real cost to the industry or other passengers to discontinuing the distribution of peanuts and products in which peanuts are a core ingredient.

I only fly airlines that do not serve peanut products. I've had to ask on numerous occasions that passengers next to me not open cans of peanuts or bags of shelled peanuts (usually I bring snacks to offer them instead or offer to buy them something). Sometimes airline staff is knowledgeable and helpful, often they are not and it's embarrassing as they do not know their own airline's policies and have treated me rather poorly, despite the amount of business I give them. The ""buffer zone"" idea does not work. In a small, closed space like a plane there is no escape from peanuts, and for those who are anaphylactic this is a nightmare. I wish we would ban the sale of peanuts at the airport, but I understand that manufacturers would be quite upset at that as it would impact their sales. Best case scenario would be a ban on airlines serving peanuts/peanut product and an announcement that asks passengers not to open/consume peanuts or peanut products on the plane at any time. 

I also wanted to put out there (for all the non-peanut allergy sufferers) that I developed this severe allergy late in life out of nowhere. Thankfully I did not have it as a child. So, it could happen to you to and I promise you it is not pleasant. Just imagine that it is you or your loved one with a severe allergy that is easy to bypass, if only the airlines would put up the ban. Also consider that having to divert and land a plane because of a severe health issue with another passenger is much more damaging to your happiness than having to forgo peanuts for a few hours of your life. 

Hopefully in the future science will learn more about the allergy and possible prevention tactics, but for now enough passengers have this problem that I think the ban is warranted. It wouldn't be such a big deal in the first place if the peanut industry hadn't spent so much money convincing people that peanuts are what you eat on planes.",,,,,,,

This is reasonable, practical, and doable.

Severely food-allergic individuals are empowered and fully capable of sharing the responsibility for their immediate environment. There will be times when it is necessary to provide a nut-free environment, and times when there is no medical necessity.  Advance notice – either way – provides a win/win situation for all parties, when necessary for passengers affected by peanut allergy.

The risk of an airborne reaction to peanut while on an airplane – in such an enclosed space consisting of re-circulated air – is legitimate. Currently, there is evidence of serious medical events due to airborne peanut particles in large(r) quantities. Miles above the ground without emergency hospital services in the immediate vicinity seems to be the least desirable situation for an anaphylactic event, for all. Bay Area Allergy Advisory Board defines the term ""peanut products"" to include: any/all products containing peanuts, as well as item(s) manufactured on shared equipment or packaged on shared equipment with peanuts.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2010-0140-0674/attachment_1.doc",

Although affecting a relatively small portion of the population, this particular allergen can be lethal to those affected, as opposed to many other types of food allergies which may cause a significant discomfort but are not deadly.  This makes the peanut an exceptional allergen necessitating its complete ban on enclosed airline flights with recirculated air and confined spaces.  I do feel empathy for diabetics, those suffering from hunger, and other people who require sustinence during flight, but there are many other alternatives to peanuts.  Peanuts do not have to be the answer.  Yes, those with peanut allergies carry Epi-pens; but Epi-pens are not a maintenance medication - they are a temporary means of first aid to bide time to get the afflicted to a hospital.  People die from peanut exposure (recent case in point- this girl was a classmate of my cousin who died on prom night a few weeks ago after accidentally eating a small amount of peanut butter http://cbs2.com/local/Teen.Dies.Peanut.2.1689075.html).  Yes, this was from actual ingestion, but even airborne exposure or surface contamination can cause someone to be quite sick.  My 6 year old peanut allergic son became ill at school a few weeks ago from surface contamination causing him to vomit.  
A total ban is needed because of this possibility of surface or airborne contamination.  Aircraft personnel cannot be held responsible for wiping down every surface between a peanut serving and peanut free flight.  The enzymes have been found to be present in filtration systems. 
We are in the unfortunate position of having to make careful risk assessments every time we entertain engaging an activity.  We can easily avoid ballgames, certain restaurants, and other events where peanuts are widely present.  However, it is difficult if not impossible to avoid them in air travel.

He might be okay if they would at least offer something else but knowing his other allergies, I usually just bring his own snack.  I know I would feel more at ease about flying if I didn't have to worry about him coming into contact with peanuts!

I recently flew in the spring to visit family in MD and was terrified.  I chose US Airways because they don't serve any peanut/tree nut products.  I realized that I was taking a chance of another passenger eating a peanut containing food item, but atleast it was better than having the whole plane eating peanuts. I figured that I would kindly ask them to refrain from eating such food.  I wasn't able to relax until we were off of the plane. 
I understand that no one can truly empathize with a parent or person dealing with food allergies.  It is so life altering and is very stressful.  Eating food is a wonderful pleasure that many of us take for granted, it shouldn't be a potential killer.  People with food allergies should carry epinephrine at all times, but it sometimes doesn't help.  Allergic anaphylaxiis requires immediate medical attention and I am sure that there isn't an airline out there that is equipped to handle such emergencies mid- flight.  There are so many other food options for people.  Why does a passenger need to bring it or an airline serve it on a flight?  In many cases, like mine, things go smoothly, but it is the what-ifs that scare me.  My son is only 2 1/2, he has no idea how much of an impact his foood allergies wiill have on him.  I hope that the DOT and society in general will open their eyes and be alittle more understanding to food allergies.  In the case of my son, his are a potentiial for anaphylaxiis, not a sensitivity.  Those are two different things.
More than 12 million Americans have food allergies.  That's one in 25, or 4 percent. one in 17 children under 3 are affected.  There are more young children being diagnosed with food SEVERE food allergies.  Food allergy is a growing public health concern for the US.
Thank you for your time.  I would love to feel comfortable visiting my family more via air travel, but I will chose to drive more often to keep my little boy safe.",,,,,,,

He has flown several times in his young life and everytime he flies I am a nervous wreck.  I have asked for a safe zone (4 rows up and back w/o peanuts) but have always sat clinching his Epi-pen, not to mention that when I have had it noted on his travel reservation, none of the staff ever seem to see it and tell me to always tell the next staff member we encounter.  I never know who was sitting in the seat before him and what that person ate or touched after eating so it is never ""safe"".  In my opinion I think that for my son and thousands of others whom have a life-threatening allergy to peanuts any seat should be ""safe"" enough to sit it when boarding a flight.  Keep in mind those that are educated on what to do in case anaphylactic reaction occurs are instructed to call 911 after having to administer Epinepherine and will need major medical attention within a 20 minute time frame.  When people are in flight, there is not an option of emergency medical attention in that short amount of time.  Thus making it a very dangerous, risky decision to use the airlines as an acceptable form of transportation.  I would be more comfortable in chosing the airline to travel if they were all peanut free.",,,,,,,

The interesting issue, as you noted in your explanation of proposed rule-making, would be controlling passengers who attempt to bring a peanut product, purchased in the terminal, on board the aircraft.  

The least restrictive scenario would be to create a time frame within which an allergic passenger must request a peanut free flight, for example 72 hours prior to scheduled departure.  The carrier would then provide notice to all passengers, on the specific flight manifest, no later than 24 hours prior to scheduled departure that their flight is now peanut free.  

Your rule should strive to put the burden of restricting the rights of other passengers on the individual seeking the accommodation.  

This is not a civil rights issue, grounded in years of discrimination, that government must rectify.  Rather, this is an attempt to make air travel more accessible to individuals who might otherwise have to utilize an alternate means of transportation to reach their final destination.",,,,,,,

I oppose the banning of peanuts on airlines for several reasons:
1. The negative economic impact in primarily rural areas would be difficult, if not impossible to overcome.  Peanuts are the cash crop in areas where little else can be produced profitably.
2.  Peanuts are an instant source of protein should there be a need to stablize blood sugar while airborne.  Diabetics in particular are suceptible to physical problems with altered schedules and access to regular meals.
3.  People with allergies usually know that they have them, especially if it is so severe as to endanger their life.  My daughter has such an allergy to peanuts.  She simply does not ingest them, or even accept them when they are offered by the attendant.  The concept of ""Personal Responsibility"" has been completely lost in the attempt to inject regulations. into every aspect of our lives.  How about some common sense here.  Don't eat the peanuts if you are allergic. 
The DOT isn't responsible to protect people from eating things that they know will harm them.  Disrupting an entire economy to protect people from a danger that doesn't exist for the vast majority is unncessary and ludicris.
The solution isn't a ban on peanuts, but to have the airplane equipped with a packet of antidote. 20mg tablets of famotidine (Pepcid) acts faster than the eppie pens and doesn't interfere with the drugs a hospital would administer in such cases.  This was the original use of the drug.",,,,,,,

I have a daughter who is ten years old and deathly allergic to peanuts.  We have trained her to be very conscientious about what she eats.  She reads every label and will not eat it even if it says it was manufactured in a plant that also manufactures peanut products.  The main problem, however, is that all that is needed for her to have a severe and (as her allergist warned) possibly deadly allergic reaction is for her to come into contact with a table or chair of someone who ate peanuts and wiped their fingers on it.

The other problem is that a person who suffers from a severe allergic reaction to something such as peanuts needs medical attention immediately.  The ""epi-pen"", which shoots epinephrine into the person's blood stream, only buys them a little time.  Without medical attention, the reaction will likely be fatal.  This means that air-travel, which for some people with peanut allergies is a virtual necessity, poses an extremely high risk since there is no guarantee that the plan can be landed within 5 minutes, with help waiting on the tarmac.

Considering the fact that peanut allergies happen to be so severe, and peanuts are certainly not a necessity to passengers nor some kind of luxury that we cannot live without, I agree with the measure to ban peanuts and peanut products.  Will such a measure lead to inecessant pushes to modify the menu in the future for even the slightest claim of danger?  I don't know.  I just know that there is such a thing as moderation, and this peanut allergy problem is severe enough, in my opinion, to fall into the category of reasonable and safe restrictions.",,,,,,,

I have been allergic to Peanuts and Tree nuts since I was 13 years old. I have an anaphilaxtic reaction with ingestion of any form of the products. I also have had reactions to the aroma of coffee or the nuts, also to the oils left by the products. I have learned that the one way to keep myself safe from having another reaction is to educate people. I have had to do this in employement situations, education situations as well as  just interactions with the general public. My family and I, almost 4 years ago now, took a trip to Florida on Delta Airlines. We booked our trip, flight and all through our travel agent, who advised the airline that I had a severe allergy to Peanuts and Tree nuts and would need a Peanut/Tree nut free flight. The airline advised that they could in fact do this for me but advised that upon boarding the plane that  I let the flight attendant know who I was and that I was the person allergic to nuts. I did do this upon boarding for take off and the flight to Florida was as planned. The flight home was a different story. Upon boarding the Delta flight to come home we advised the flight attendant of my allergy, she rudely stated that she was unaware of my requests and she would do what she could. When the time came for snack offerings that same flight attendant served a man 2 seats in front of me peanuts. I spent the entire flight home in a haze from medication taken as a procautionary measure to ensure that I would be safe the entire flight home. I am never embarassed when it comes down to saving my life and for me this is a life or death situation. I would like to ask that the DOT ban the serving of peanut and tree nut products from flights. There are other alternatives that are just as healthly and beneficial that may be served on flights. Thank you for considering my health as well as the health of the growing number of individuals with peanut and tree nut allergies.",,,,,,,

And while I sympathize with anyone who has a life-threatening allergy I don’t think an all out ban would be warranted due to:

A. The fact that not every flight has someone who is that allergic to peanuts on every flight. 
B. Planes are used by a lot of people. In regards to public places and airplanes you never know if someone who touched something ate a PB&J prior to doing so etc. You cannot ban products or foods on a large enough scale to prevent someone from contaminating an area.
C. If you do it for peanuts you have to do it for every severe allergy case out there to avoid discrimination. Some people have a severe reaction to substances other than peanuts or tree nuts by simply touching them or inhaling them.

Solutions:
- Have epi pens on flights and make sure the crew is trained in the use of them. This should not be hard as they are extremely easy to use.
- Make people call ahead when they have an allergy so you can accommodate people's allergies by serving something else and asking others on board to refrain from consuming the offending products until they deplane.
- Let the allergy sufferer know you can't protect them 100% from contamination of the plane and if they cannot come into contact (via inhalation or skin contact) with the tiniest amount of something without having a reaction flying is going to put them at risk.",,,,,,,

For two years we have been learning how to manage his allergies.   I am a firm believer that my son must learn to grow up in a world where peanuts exist and that he can not be protected by ""everyone else"" - he must be his strongest advocate.  I will not advocate for a peanut free school as a means of protection because my son will have options to keep him safe such as sitting at a peanut free table. As long as my son has options, I feel like my job is to educate him on his options and teach him to make decisions that will keep him safe. However, I am strongly for the banning of peanuts on flights. I would certainly be supportive of a ban during the flight in which an allergic person is on board, but would prefer that peanuts were banned altogether. 
While on a plane a peanut allergic person has no options and no way to protect themselves from the presence of peanuts.  The air is recirculated throughout the flight, constantly exposing the allergic person to the allergen. Additionally, the reside of peanuts could potentially be on everything in the plane.  For someone like my son who can't even touch the residue of peanuts without scratching himself until he bleeds, the potential for a severe reaction is nearly guaranteed. 
I don't think it is unreasonable for people to refrain from eating peanuts during a flight, and for airlines to choose a snack that isn't a death trap for a growing population.  
I hate that it will have an impact on farmers throughout the country, but know that under the current standards in which only a few seats are ""peanut free"" a growing portion of the population with lethal food allergies will be unable to use airplanes as a means for transportation.  As airlines are required to make accommodations for other disabilities or unique circumstances I do not think creating peanut free flights is an unreasonable requests.",,,,,,,

Since I cannot eat other foods such as beef jerky due to other medical problems, my only real option is to eat nuts.  The most effective food to address both my short- and long-term blood sugar problems is some form of chocolate covered peanuts, such as Peanut M&M's.

I strongly urge airlines to ban peanuts and products containing peanuts on board passenger flights.  My children are ""touch"" sensitive to peanuts and are prescribed epinephrine auto-injectors.  What most airlines and people do not realize is that an epinephrine auto-injector works for 20 minutes - after which additional injections or other steriods need to be administered.  We travel with 3 or 4 epinephrine auto-injectors per child when on an airplane - that gives us approximately one hour to safely land a plane and get to an ambulance!  I think that airlines and people also don't realize that epinephrine auto-injectors can injure a young child's heart and other organs...  As to the question of real incidents in flight, I have had one child come down with hives on a short flight (I don't know whether the peanuts were airborne or from residue - it is so hard to tell) that necessitated a dose of Benadryl to avert a more severe allergic reaction.   On another flight, I have had a stewardess angrily urge us to get off the plane because - despite my calling customer service twice before our flight date and their assuring us that they would make announcements asking people ""to please refrain from eating peanut products while on board because of small children with allergies being on board..."" ""and to avoid an emergency medical landing,"" and that they would not serve the mixed nuts in first class - she refused to do any of those things to help keep my children safe - and right in front of them!

We have two young boys who have peanut and nut allergies.  Flying on commercial airlines has always been worrisome for us and especially stressful for our boys who both realize the potential risk of being on an airplane with peanuts served on board.  For a child with a life-threatening allergy, a peanut is like a loaded gun.
We always fly with epi-pens and we are grateful that we are able to bring them on board.  I hope we will always be able to bring them on the airplane.  While it would be good to have extras on board provided by the airlines, as the parents we are always very careful to have epi-pens with the correct dosages and ones that have not expired.
We have been on board flights where the pilot announced before the flight that there were passengers with peanut allergies and that any meals with nuts that are usually available from the airlines would not be served for Rows 1 to 10 for example (5 rows front and back of the allergic passengers), and passengers in those rows should not eat any food they may have brought on board that would have any peanuts.  I really appreciated the consideration of the airline and the flight crew for their understanding and help (Delta Airlines).  
However, I have also flown with other airlines that were not very helpful and simply told me they would still be serving peanuts to the passengers but that we could simply decline the peanuts.  This airline did not seem to fully understand the severity and danger of food allergies (American Airlines).
Our children are sensitive to any products that have peanuts or certain nuts, so products like peanut butter or products that were manufactured in a facility that processes peanuts or nuts (with trace amounts) could potentially induce an anaphylactic reaction as well.
Thank you for protecting our children and so many other children and adults who are unfortunately being diagnosed with life-threatening food allergies.",,,,,,,

Unlike the children who suffer from this allergy today, I did not have peanut free tables at school, etc., and therefore did suffer physical illness due to either smelling or breathing in airborne proteins. However, my allergy has been carefully managed, and my amount of anaphylactic reactions have been limited. I currently carry Epipens & Benadryl everywhere. I avoid restaurants like Texas Road House that have peanuts strewn about the establishment. I’m responsible for my own actions as an allergy sufferer. However, I can’t control or be responsible for the environment created for me by an airline. I fear flying because I could go into anaphylactic shock at 30,000 feet. Epipens do not stop anaphylaxis, just delay it and cause cardiovascular instability. I have taken flights overseas, and when there are peanuts aboard, flight personnel and fellow passengers are sometimes hostile. In those cases, I've had both allergic reactions and panic attacks during the flight, and they were the worst experiences of my life. Some people tell me I should be confined to a mask. In that case, I could not drink or eat the entire flight, denying me very basic human rights. Also, protein can still enter the bloodstream through other avenues. If someone ate peanuts in my seat during the previous flight, I could suffer a reaction just from skin contact. Peanut free zones would not help. All the air is recycled. The indifference of some of my fellow citizens who do not suffer life-threatening allergies is disheartening. Some people say drive or get a private plane. Could I drive to the Bahamas? Could anyone truly afford to take a private plane? And if they could, is it the best use of their money during this trying time in our economy? I’d count it a great victory for those of us with these ""disabilities"" if banning peanuts was a step taken by the DOT. Thank you for finally considering it.",,,,,,,

While this is a serious concern, those with such severe alergies are a small minority. Banning all peanuts on all flights seems unreasonable, when most flights would not have an alergic person on  board. However, because it is so severe, upon prior notification, the airline should ban peanuts from the flight the alergic person will be on AND the previous flight, to allow any residual peanut dust to dissapate. Also, on the affected flight, passenges should be requested not to eat anything containing peanuts which they brought on board.

I believe it is not necessary to ban peanuts from airlines because there is no way the rule could be enforced. However, it does make sense for airlines to not serve peanuts.  There are plenty of other nutritious snacks to serve - like pretzels.  However, parents need to understand that eEven if the airline doesn't serve peanuts, there is no way the airline can guarantee that a passenger didn't bring peanuts on board.  My daughter has a severe peanut allergy.  When she was 2 years old we were flying on an airline that didn't serve peanuts.  Before the flight took off, my daughter leaned down to the floor under my seat and picked up a peanut!  I was shocked and so thankful I discovered it before she put it in her mouth.  I asked if peanuts were served and was told they were not.  We were the first to board the plane so I believe the peanut was from a previous flight.  Unless the planes are THOROUGHLY cleaned and sterilized between each flight, there is no way to guarantee that the plane is peanut free.  I believe a good solution would be to have an EpiPen(or several) plus Benadryl on board the aircraft at all times.  I would guess the greatest risk is in those travelers who are age 5 and under. Parents/Guardians need to carry an EpiPen with them at all times and watch their child VERY CAREFULLY  if they are on an airplane.   It would help  if airlines just didn't serve peanuts.  But, to ban them all together would be useless.",,,,,,,

As a frequent international traveler, I think it is imperative that the tarmac delay rules be applied to international airlines.  There should be NO reason for any airline to force people to stay in any place for that amount of time.  I think 3 hours is even too long.  The airlines make the argument that flights get cancelled or there are not enough customs officials to handle the number of people.  I cannot count the times that I have got off a flight and been quarantined which makes it so I do not have to go through customs and then can go right back on the plane.  Why can we not do the same?  If they know there is going to be an hour delay, debark the aircraft, let passengers stretch their legs and get some water and the reboard the aircraft.  This is not that complicated.  It only takes aproximately 30 min to board an aircraft.",,,,,,,

My 5 yr old (Aidan) was diagnosed with a sereve peanuts allergy at 15mths.

If there are good reasons for the domestic rule then the rule must apply to all flights operating domestically.

Objections as to unintended consequences to passengers is not valid.  The airline can not presume to know the consequences of - remaining on the plane or disembarking.
The point remains: Being involuntarily detained in an airplane beyond the service time contracted in the purchase of the ticket constitutes imprisonment.  
Whether the flight continues or is cancelled, the offer must be made to the passenger to allow them to disembark.

If he comes in contact with peanuts or perhaps even airborne in that tight of an environment, it could be disasterous.  I know some people may feel inconvienienced about losing their right to munch on peanuts, but this measure could save lives.  How about munching on pretzles or something similar?  Sometimes, food really can kill.  I'm asking that this be passed for my son and others like him.",,,,,,,

Peanuts on Airplanes.  Many friends ask me about my daughter's very dangerous peanut allergy and I give them a comparison that hits home.  I say let's pretend that there is a sidewalk for my daughter to walk on, but your child needs to walk in the street with cars driving up and down it. Your child could get hit by a car and killed-maybe they wouldn't but maybe they would. You wouldn't put your child in that situation so why should I have to put my daughter on a plane with peanuts that could kill her!!

There are so many other foods that could be better serving passengers and the obesity problem in the country while keeping children like my daughter safe.  Apples, oranges, bananas, pretzels, crackers are just a few of the ideas.  

Peanuts could kill my daughter.  If she sits in a seat where a passenger previously ate peanuts and any peanut oil rubs on her and she doesn't know it-we will need an EPI pen and emergency landing.  It just isn't worth it.  No one is going to die if they don't eat a peanut-only if they do.  T",,,,,,,

I feel strongly that the mid-flight response to an anaphalactic reaction would be inferior to hospital services, and perhaps life threatening.  I strongly believe that an airline passenger suffering from an allergic reaction to peanuts would terrify other passengers on the flight.  I have three children ten and under.  Of these three, one is peanut-allergic.  I understand the dilemma of the non-allergic person going without peanut products, but I feel it is a responsible and caring effort to make to insure a safe environment for all.  Recently, our family attended a baseball game where someone in front of us, knowing that our son is allergic to peanuts, opened the bag, ate the nuts, and threw the shells at my son's feet.  The wind proceeded to blow them all around us, and we were forced to move.  I feel that the family did not fully understand how dangerous this action could be, but it truly ruined the ballpark experience for us, and made me feel discouraged with the current consideration level of society.  I wondered, am I discriminating against others, in believing that they should be considerate, and simply resign my son to the fact that he will be designated to a ""special area"" in his activities for the rest of his life?  My family recently went on a family vacation to Washington D.C., and chose to drive rather than fly.  Just less worry in terms of the allergy.  We have been putting off a family trip to Ireland and Scotland until my son is old enough to express an unusual sensation that might be brought about from peanut exposure.  The allergy does restrict us and countless other families.  I would be happy to go without peanuts on flights if it means a better quality of life for so many others.  I suspect peanuts are simply an inexpensive snack to provide on flights.  How about pretzels?",,,,,,,

As for the potential of causing canceled flights and leaving passengers stranded at an airport vs hours locked in a plane on the tarmac, how about requiring the airline to make the choice known to the passengers...then, passengers can decide for themselves what they want to do.  Passengers willing to take the flight and accept the possible tarmac delay could sign a waiver, relieving the carrier of liability for that and those that would rather wait in an airport can do so.  

It all comes down to transparency and allowing passengers to decide for themselves.  Right now there is no transparency with regard to this issue and the airlines decide for the passengers....neither is acceptable, and this should be remedied ASAP.",,,,,,,

This should not be a survival situation with rationing and sweltering conditions.  
I believe that the airports, as the universal common ground to all flights domestic and international, should make available a quarantined area where passengers can disembark to, similar to the area for international passengers proceeding to other destinations.  This would preclude the need for customs issues, provide proper accomidations and lavatory facilities for passengers.

In my opinion, just having a flight be peanut free is not enough unless the whole cabin is going to be cleaned prior to the allergy sufferer boarding the aircraft.

He neither ate nor touched one.  I would like him (and the millions of others with peanut allergies) to be able to continue to be an air travel customer, but the risk is very high when airlines pass peanuts out to every person on every flight.  His career options will also be very limited if he is unable to fly, considering the amount of travel required for many jobs.  There are so many people with life-threatening peanut allergies, and the number is increasing.  Please choose the option that prevents airlines from serving peanuts.  There are many other options of non-perishable snacks that airlines can serve, and it is understood that people would still be able to bring their own peanuts if they choose.  It shouldn't offend anyone's sense of civil liberty.  I am not offended that an Italian restaurant does not offer to sell me an egg roll.  It's just not what they offer.  The airlines just won't have peanuts available for sale or pass them out.  It's just not what they offer.  It will greatly reduce the amount of nut dust in the air and on the fabric seats, making air travel a much safer options for severely allergic people.",,,,,,,

I am:
1) a frequent air traveler
2) a parent
3) a pharmacist
4) a psychologist
5) nationally published on the the Americans with Disabilities Act

I understand allergies and anaphylaxis.
What I fail to understand is why someone with a peanut allergy feels that banning peanuts being served on an airplane is less risky than sitting next to another traveler who had just consumed peanuts (at an airport eatery, a snack vendor shop at the airport, or even in that second traveler's car on the way to the airport). Peanut dust is peanut dust. And by extension, if we ban peanuts on airplanes we should requite that NO traveler would be allowed to board if they had recently consumed peanuts. This is illogical and unenforceable.

The fear of having an anapylactic reaction at 36000 feet is real. But I am a heart patient, and I carry with me nitroglycerin to thwart any untoward heart symptoms (which can be as life-threatenting to me as peanuts could be to a sensitive person.)

Airplanes do have defibrillators (thanks!). They should carry- in addition to oxygen (thanks!)- the epinephrine injection that many commenters have discussed. Additionally, the airlines could make available to any traveler who requests one a mask to filter particulates.

The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-136) states that providers of common services (like airplanes and other entities) must make REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS for persons with disabilities (and yes, a peanut allergy ""qualifies"" as a disabling condition.) The ADA does NOT mandate ""banning"" anything.

I feel that the air carriers can make a ""reasonable accommodation"" with the ""availability"" of masks, oxygen, and epinephrine injections.

I would close by saying that any traveler with a peanut allergy who does NOT have such items with them personally is rather foolish- like I would be without my nitroglycerin.",,,,,,,

I am a 43 year old woman who has had severe allegic reactions to nuts since birth. I have had reactions from ingesting, skin contact, and airborne contact with nut products. Examples include eating a bit of food that was mislabled that contained tree nuts, requiring emergency room care, severe eye swelling affecting vision and skin rash from peanuts in bowls and shells on the ground, skin rash from someone touching me who had just eaten nuts, and other incidents. My allergy is life threatening and in a confined space such an aircraft with no access to medical care, I fear for my life. I am disabled because I cannot access the same rights as other citizens-among these the right to breathe. Smoking was banned from air travel for this very reason. I support a rule that airlines would need to accomodate people with nut allergies by announcing to all passengers the presence of a nut allergic passenger and by agreeing not to serve nuts on flights when requested in advance by a ticketed passenger. My sister and brother are also allergic to nuts and face the same danger on flights. I have been trying to find research to help DOT with this rule. I think the best research is the depositions of people with allergies. I feel the DOT could secure many patients and their doctors who could confirm these life threatening reactions. Also, I am pasting the contact information from one research study I read online. I am sure DOT could find more research studies such as this by searching.  Please help us fly safely. We don't want to take away rights, we just want the same safe access to air travel that others enjoy. Maybe airlines could hand out closed packs of nuts as people get off the planes if the peanut industry would agree to that. Thank you, and here is the study info:

If he accidentally ingests even a minute amount of peanut protein he can die.  Everyday there is that risk.  We understand that aspect of this allergy.  Logically if you weigh the right of an individual sitting on a plane to have a bag of peanuts (whereupon when opened the peanut dust will go into the air, perhaps land on the seat) as a snack that they can clearly live without- versus the right of the person with the nut allergy to arrive safely at their destination - there is no choice to be made.  The individual who wants the snack can have a multitude of other choices whereas the person with the food allergy has no choice.  What would you argue if it was your child or spouse with this life-threatening allergy?  Would you want their lives to be limited because of a snack food?  I think not.  Please make the right choice and remove peanuts from airplanes.  Thank you for your consideration.

At present Delta Airlines (and probably others as well) charges 55 US dollars/Canadian dollars/euros for a second piece of checked luggage. These currencies are not equivalent. When I recently returned from Prague, Czech Republic, I was told that I had to pay in euros or my bag would be destroyed. As I result I was overcharged about $13; had the US dollar been weaker I would have been charged quite a bit more. I believe that as a US carrier or a carrier flying to the US, Delta and other airlines must accept US dollars for whatever fees they charge. 
As someone who travels frequently, I believe that the federal government needs to define what constitutes the basic services that an airline passenger will receive from an airline operating in or to the US. Such things as water, toilets, a certain minimum amount of carry-on luggage, availability of food, a pre-assigned seat. The airlines seem to feel that when one purchases a ticket it is only a vague idea that eventually one will be taken from one point to another and that the purchase price is only the beginning of the payment process.

I flew out of JFK most of the time and at times all the taxiways were full of acft. and all the gates were full of aircraft loading or unloading.  There was really no place to go.  If you make the them unload and reboard, the crew will have to be replaced and that will involve another 3 or more hour delay.  In all of my career when we had a lengthy delay and asked the passengers if they wanted to stop the flight and have it probably delayed for many more hours in all cases they said lets wait out.  There were never over one or two passengers that wanted off and 200 that wanted to continue to wait.  The crew and airlilne do not purposely delay the flight, something unusual causes the delay.

Everyone is bypassing the baggage fees and bringing suitcases to the gate that don't fit and you get an instant FREE check at gate OR the time boarding is so delayed because people dump bags into overheads that don't fit, then get full then walk from the back to get to the front to get bag checked again at the gate.  I have never seen such disorganization, confusion, delays and obviously increased costs for the delays.

Regional airports - SNA for example American Airlines.  Bag check-in at Kiosk's to pay for baggage and print bag check tags instead of one gate agent that you have to show your driver's license, check-in, pay fee and it takes forever -- extremely inefficient.  Operational efficiencies.

TSA lines -- for pete's sake, airports know the busiest times.  Increase TSA safety personnel, belts.

Overbooking of flights - maximum overbooking limit.  With decreased flights to cities, overbooking has become a nightmare.

Enforce heavy people buying two seats.  In 737 ariplanes, heavy people spill into your seat.  This should not be allowed and people need to take responsibility or take a train or bus if they can't buy two seats or lose weight for their health.

24 hour cancellation - awesome idea.  

If you book a flight and prices come down prior to departure, credits should be issued w/o an exorbinant change fee proposed.

Tarmac rules -- no more than one hour and provide fluids.

Healthier meals on planes.

Famiily/Liquid Lines -- when there is only one other line to go through security at 6:30am flights and the ""handicapped"" line is so short, they should accomodate passengers period.  Handicapped line with 2 belts and TSA security lines running is riciculous!  They already let wheelchairs in first.

Adquate parking at airports.

Our son has severe peanut allergies, and travel by air has always been difficult  and scarey.  He can not even tolerate the smell with out feeling ill.   One of my fears is  if the airlines provide a buffer zone, is that the prior person in this same seat consumed peanuts and that there is oil or residue left from that person.  When we have flown in the past and peanuts are servered, he has to immediatley take benedryl, then he tries to block the smell by hiding under a coat or something similar to hide from  the odor, but it does not help. By the time we land he is usually pale and weak. Then with some fresh or different air his color and strength begins to return.  The buffer zone for people with an allergy as severe as his will not help.  Those that are allergic can smell the peanuts long before those that are not allergic, and to them it is a sickening smell.  Flight is some times the only way to travel and to know that there something that could be  truely avoided  on that flight and will be around you is very frightening when you are this allergic.  Pretzels (not cooked in peanut oil), sunchips, or something similar could be served.  Please put yourself in the shoes of someone that a simple smell makes you ill, and accidental touch makes you swell and sick, and a possible accidental ingestion could kill you, then fly with it all around you.

I have several family members with such allergies and have been a member of FAAN (Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network) for over 10 years.

1.  DOT raises a serious issue, not only for children and adults who experience allergic reactions on board (one-third of which involve anaphylaxis, according to a review of studies between 2010 and 1999)* -- but also in terms of cost and inconvenience to other passengers and airlines when in-flight emergencies occur.  

2.  I understand a general ban on peanuts and possibly tree-nuts may be off the table at this time.  Therefore, my comments address two per-flight alternatives that have been suggested in the past:  ""buffer zones"" and removal of peanut/tree-nut snacks served by the airline.

3.  Removal of peanut and tree-nut snacks served by the airline is far preferable to a buffer zone.  Removal offers superior risk-reduction and simplicity and reduces cleaning costs and seating assignment problems.  However, at least three factors limit the effectiveness of this accommodation. First, we understand airlines cannot control what passengers bring and consume on board.  Second, actual implementation of food-allergy accommodations have been inconsistent in the past; that is, promises at booking have often not been honored on board.  Third, there are six other allergens, other than peanuts and tree-nuts, which account for 90% of US food allergies.  So, it is an imperfect world.  Given that reality, eliminating peanut/tree-nut snacks served by the airline, on a flight where a passenger has requested this accommodation, is about the best way I can think of to substantially reduce risk for a very significant number of passengers.

I am very good at avoiding foods, but sometimes people give them to me unknowingly. Sometimes, they are in the area and I cannot control that. However, these reactions become worse each time, and I now must be intubated (have a breathing tube). This requires a paramedic or a Dr, who are not usually available at 30,000 feet. Even if they were , do they have the necessary equipment? What will happen?

For the people who are complaining about banning peanuts it isn't life or death. It is an inconvenience, and what they see as too much government control.

I have personal experience regarding the concerns of people having peanuts and/or peanut products aboard a plane.  Both of my sons have nut allergies.  When we fly, we have to request a peanut free flight.  The airlines have always been extremely helpful and willing to do so.  However, when they announce the fact that it is a peanut free flight, we always hear remarks from others on the flight.  We have to make sure to wipe down all items to take away any peanut dust that might exist.  We bring our own snacks, and we are very cautious of what our two children touch (we always seem to find peanut wrappers located in the seat pockets).  We face the daily challenges of making sure our children do not eat anything that contains nuts, made in the same facility as nuts, and/or made on the same machinery as nut products; however, being in a confined space of an airplane, we have to be extra cautious.  We are not overly protective; both of our children are aware of their allergy, come near others enjoying peanut products, they just understand they cannont eat, and if they by chance touch anything, they wash their hands.  We always carry medicine to have just in case.  This is all the same on an airplane, the huge difference is, if my child was exposed to any type of nut, we are in the middle of the air within a confined plane.  I hate to ban peanut items for all, that is not how we look or handle their allergy, but being on a plane is a scary experience for two boys who don't get scared about much.  Being thousands of feet above ground with peanut products all around is a scary and stressful situation.  Even though the airlines bans peanuts on our peanut free flight, they still offer us pretzels (we don't take them because they are made on the same machinery as peanuts).  Thank you for listening to my comments, and I really hope that the consideration of banning all peanut products is take",,,,,,,

To comment on how a peanut ban would ""inconvenience"" other passengers, most people only fly a few times a year and the flights last on average 2-3 hours. Considering this, is asking them not to eat peanuts a few times a year, for a couple of hours really an inconvenience? They can eat them before and after the flight just as smokers must wait.

I believe this goes beyond the idea of a ""disability"" and into the realm of personal responsibility.  I understand that some people feel they cannot fly due to allergies to peanut products, but that is their choice.  This is not a disability that needs a mandated solution.

I have allergies of my own, including to bee stings, so there are places I do not go, such as u-pick-it orchards and other botanical sites.  It would be ridiculous for me to request that federal law mandate beekeeping protective suits be kept at these sites so that I may also pick strawberries.  People who choose not to fly have other travel options, including cars, trains and ships.  Only international travel could be truly out of the question for these allergy sufferers, and even then US regulation would not apply.  Therefore, the inconvenience of travel issue is moot.

I can see where ""peanut-free"" flights could be sold, based on the need, cost and convenience for airlines and passengers, but a mandate is intrusive for other passengers.  If I brought my own peanut butter sandwich on the plane, would I be forcibly ejected from my flight?  If it was truly ""peanut free,"" I would guess that the airline would be legally-bound to tossing me from the plane.  Will there be peanut-sniffing dogs at security points?

People with severe allergies can purchase re-breathers or air masks to filter out air impurities.  They can travel with epi-pens to combat an attack should one occur.  The fact is that people could fly with proper accommodations, but they are not willing to pay their own money for those accommodations.  Asking the rest of us to pay for this, directly or indirectly, is inappropriate.  Please do not institute a ""peanut ban"" on domestic airlines.",,,,,,,

The people sitting in my row and the row behind/in front of us were visibly irritated, wondering why the people in front of them were given peanuts, but they were not allowed to have them.  The flight attendant explained that ""someone in this area has an allergy"" and several of them continued to appear irritated and confused.  I spoke up and explained that it was my daughter, that that peanut dust can cause a reaction, and clearly felt the irritation of some directed toward me.  
I do not like to draw attention to my daughter's allergy.  We do not want to cause a scene or problem due to her allergy.  I want her to have as ""normal"" a life as possible.  This approach of a peanut free zone on a flight makes no sense to me- it only serves to irritate those who do not get the peanuts.  The alternative- to just not serve them at all- is more logical, as people typically do not question that.
We have decided to stick with Southwest Airlines- even though they are known for serving peanuts, they always serve alternate snacks on our flights to the entire plane and we appreciate that.  Nobody ever questions it or becomes irritated when peanuts are simply not an option.
With each generation, there are many, many more peanut allergies being diagnosed.  It only makes sense to eliminate peanuts from flights.  Life-threatening peanut allergies are becoming common, and flying with peanuts puts the person in an environment where they cannot escape or get help if a reaction were to occur.

So, I said come talk to me in a minute when I get settled in my seat with my two kids.  She had a gentleman come talk to me that was in charge of the crew.  He said he couldn't promise me anything.  I simply said, ""If someone consumes a peanut or any tree nuts and my son can breathe in the particles or so much as smells it he can go into a  anaphylaxis reaction and could potentially die.  I will administer his epi pen and then you will have to land the plan asap and I will have to take him to the nearest hospital."" Then he finally made the announcement.  Things like this should not be happening.  I wouldn't do this for the fun of it.  It's my son's life on the line.  If I knew something was going to affect someone's life that I could avoid, I would certainly do it without any hesitation.  I don't know why these people think they can play with someone's life.  A child's no doubt.  It really makes me think not to ever travel with Air Canada again.  I have never had any issues with West Jet or any other airline that I have travelled with in the last 7 years.  My son is only 7 and was diagnosed with his peanut and tree nut allergies at the age of 3.  I just hope that someone doesn't have to die because someone on a flight didn't think it's important enough to make a broadcast message to inform the crew and passengers of this.  It would be a very sad situation and it doesn't take much to make sure that nuts and peanuts are not consumed during these flights.",,,,,,,

This occured within minutes of being exposed to the food.  10 minutes after exposure, she had trouble breathing and her blood pressure dropped.  If this ever happens in an airplane, it could be disastrous.  

We would certainly appreciate a ban on nut and peanut products being SERVED on the airplane while a peanut or nut allergic person is flying.  One step better is to also vacuum the plane before the allergic person boards.  At some point, it is just easier, more efficient to ban nuts/peanuts. We don't care that the occasional person brings their own peanut or nut product (though some people can have a life threatening reaction just breathing in the particles from one or two people with peanuts).  Rather, it is when hundreds of people are cracking open packages of nuts/peanuts, the levels of peanut or nut protein sky rockets. An allergic person has no where to go.  The very real possibility of a death or near death (e.g., coma) becomes more likely.  

Banning the serving of nuts/peanuts would probably make some people angry.  But would you rather have an angry person than a dead person?",,,,,,,

Our son is severly allergic to peanuts/nuts. 
We have flown Northwest airlines beacuse they had not routinely served peanuts. We thought this was the norm due to the increase in peanut allergies. We had booked Northwest and since their merge with Delta we we on a Delta flight. We explained to the airlines attendant about our sons allergies and she stated the policy is not to serve peanuts 3 rows in front of us and 3 rows behind. 
Few things that the attendents are obviously not aware of-1. airborne allergies 2. the peple who eat the peanuts do not sanitize their hands after eating and touch many surfaces-especially the seats and bathroom doors that my son also has to touch, and 3. the uncomfortable feelings that we had to endure when people were asking why they did not get the option of peanuts and the people behind them did. 
Is this a violation of the Americans with Disabiliites Act to center out the person with the allergy? 
It is horrible to have an allergy like this and we should have the right to take part in any activity that others can. 
I would not wish this on anyone. I am in panic each day that my 8 year old son will come in contact. 
Please these are enclosed environments and just like you had to ban smoking on airplanes is it so hard to not serve peanuts/ nuts and if you has to make an emergency landing-is it really worth it to serve peanuts knowing the possible consequence.

These types of deadly allergies are on the rise among our children; the evidence of this is everywhere in the literature.  To NOT do something about this within the airline industry would be irresponsible. My child did not ask for this allergy yet the airlines put his life at risk every time we board a plane. There are so many food alternatives that could be offered onboard an aircraft; it seems ridiculous that peanuts are still served in light of the severity they pose to allergic individuals.  An epipen only buys you 15 minutes to get immediate medical attention and even then, sometimes death can still occur.

I'm severely allergic to all nuts including peanuts and tree nuts and have been since I was a baby (20 years ago).  I fly a few times a year and have been able most of the time to avoid flights that serve nuts, but it has required extra effort and inconvenience on my part.
One time I had to take a flight where nuts were served and it was a scary experience.  There was a very strong possibility that nut particles blown throughout the cabin with recirculated air could cause me to have an allergic reaction.  I carried several Epi-pens and Benadryl, but there is a limit to how long they are effective. The people around me agreed not to eat their snacks and an attendant offered to deploy an oxygen mask.  The flight was only about an hour and I did not have an reaction, but the experience was traumatic.
Being forced to possibly use an oxygen mask and requesting that some people go hungry are extreme and excessive measures.  Eating nuts is not an integral part of flying and switching them out for snacks without nuts would be a minor inconvenience with enormous benefits.  Not serving nuts in the first place would eliminate the need to disturb passengers about a nut allergy.
I strongly support this rule to ban airlines from serving snacks and meals containing nut products because of the potential for nut particles to be circulated throughout the plane and cause an allergic reaction.  More and more people have allergies to nuts and it is very important that this rule, a common sense solution to a serious problem, become law.",,,,,,,

I personally know of two people who cannot even BREATHE in the same room where there are peanuts.

I never want to see a child or an adult suffer an anaphylactic reaction in the cabin with me.   My understanding is Epi-pens give about 20min of time in delaying the reaction.   Even with two Epi-pens, could the pilot be redirected to a close airport to land in 40 min if that is what was required to get the child to medical attention before their airway closed, suffocating them?

The number of people affected is not more than 1% of the population, and those with allergies will not have a severe reaction unless the peanuts are eaten.  Furthermore, it is the responsibility of those with allergies to take whatever precautions are necessary - just as they must do *wherever* they go for the rest of their life, including restaurants.  Restaurants are only required to indicate which foods may contain nuts - not to ban nuts from their menus, although (according to the charges) even being in the same room with nuts could cause a reaction.  Those who insist on not flying due to allergies can do something very simple - they can CALL the airline to inquire if there are some flights that do not serve peanuts, and book accordingly.  Many airlines, including Southwest, often serve pretzels and cheese crackers as snacks, instead of peanuts.  

If we ban peanuts, then we should ban small (crying) children, too, because frankly I think most people are allergic to loud, screaming infants and children.  Think of the *stress* that does to the body and how stress affects the immune system.  People with more stress have a significantly higher risk of dying from heart disease, and a myriad of other problems.  If peanut allergies affect 1% of the population, the crying-child allergy affects probably near 99%.

What particularly bothered me in point #12 is the assumption that if you carry and use an epipen (or other auto epinephrine injector) that you would be saved from an anaphylaxis episode.

Those without an allergy or a child with allergies can't imagine the anxiety and fear that comes with public situations like airports and flying. My son carries 2 EpiPens in case of exposure but it's not magic wand, anaphylaxis can continue even after an EpiPen injection and immediate emergency care is required, this means an emergency landing for the airplane. 

I agree with the comments from onespotallergy.com. 

""I suggest that when an allergic passenger is on a flight, without identifying and possibly embarrassing the passenger, everyone in that row plus the two rows in front and behind that passenger be spoken to one on one and asked not to eat any nut products they may have bought onto the flight."" This would be in addition to the airline itself serving a peanut and tree nut free snack. 

""Crumbs fall, hands are wiped on the seats, latches to seat trays, lavatories, and storage bins can have oily residue from the peanuts on them, as can flight attendants' hands after serving nuts.  While stranded at 30,000 feet with the possibility of requiring an emergency landing and out of country health care, you can see why the passenger would be extremely uncomfortable even if not suffering a severe allergic reaction.""

""Though flying is inherently risky, by requiring airlines to become nut free, you will create the safest environment possible in a public area.  You will have controlled the things that you can control by avoiding peanuts, tree nuts, and all products that contain ingredients derived from them, even in trace amounts.  It’s quite easy to get packaged peanut and tree nut free products from companies like Enjoy Life Foods to serve on a flight with signed declarations concerning the allergens.""",,,,,,,

Some are so allergic that any of these substances will set them off. Sitting next to someone who ate a peanut-butter sandwich, being around people who bring their own food; someone traveling with a pet or someone whose pet sleeps on their bed or in their laundry; someone who has walked through grass or bushes and then gone to the airport, someone who hauls plants in their vehicle. 

It's sad that there are some people who are exceptionally allergic, but perhaps we can't legislate for every single thing. Me, I don't enjoy children who fuss and kick the seat behind me by the hour and I'm sure it raises my blood pressure--which isn't healthy. Should they be banned too? (I wouldn't mind...only the badly-behaved ones, of course.) I also find it distasteful to sit next to someone who has been drinking alcohol and/or smoking or who has body odor or wears perfume. Maybe we can kick them off as well!

If you're supe- sensitive to something, you have to weigh the risks and benefits of traveling on a public vehicle, whether it's a taxi, bus, train, boat or plane. Maybe those who suffer so badly should try driving.

I'm not a particular advocate for or against peanuts, or drinking or smoking or not bathing or picking and choosing among small children, etc. It's just that this whole debate seems ridiculous. Where do you draw the line on what to prevent?",,,,,,,

I truly feel for anyone who has a severe, life-threatening allergy.  It requires constant vigilance.  That being said, I don't think that banning peanuts is appropriate.  Those with the allergy have options, such as other forms of travel and epi-pens.  There are others who have severe allergies to other substances - should we ban those as well?  

While support and protection of the individual is vital, doing so at the expense of all others should be minimized to absolutely critical items.  I believe the ban would place an undue burden on all passengers and airlines.  It would remove a nutritious food (think obesity epidemic) and would result in increased fees for airlines which would be passed on to the consumer.

I do believe that providing protection is important, but we simply cannot protect everyone from everything.  It's cost-prohibitive and places an undue burden on society as a whole.  Each person has certain limitations, health or otherwise.  If we were to take into account all limitations and try to equalize things for everyone, there would be nothing we could do.  Risk is a part of life - each person must determine their own needs and not expect society as a whole to protect them.  It's a very slippery slope indeed.

I also believe that the peanut allergy issue should not be its own unique issue, but should be bundled with other health and safety issues that a small percentage of passengers face.  This would allow others to gain some protection, such as those with other severe allergies and immune deficient people:

1.  Require all airlines to carry epi-pens on all flights.
2.  Require those with peanut allergies to carry an epi-pen.
3.  Require airlines to carry certified, hermetically sealed seat coverings, blankets, pillows and face masks for those that require additional protection.
4.  Allow airlines to charge a reasonable fee for those needing additional protection and fines for non-compliance.",,,,,,,

However, after reading a number of the open comments I believe that banning peanuts on flights or flights containing person(s) aboard with these allergies will be very difficult at best.  If a proposed ban on peanuts is passed it will create a whole new category of goods that the TSA agents will now have to look for;  peanuts, peanut butter products and any other product that has peanut oil or nuts in their ingredients.  If someone is going to bring them on board for a snack there is no guarantee that any particular passenger will voluntarily give up those products or not eat them during flight.  These items cannot be detected or identified by x-ray or other currently used TSA devices.  I see a real potential for litigation against those that brought/ate them on board or for the peanut dust left behind by the last passenger assigned to that seat.  There are language barriers and many other reasons why someone didn't think or comply that such a ban.  As a frequent flier,  I would not support such a ban, other than what the airlines already do to help accommodate passengers with this allergy.",,,,,,,

My daughter is SEVERELY allergic to peanuts and tree nuts.  These allergies are life threatening and we carry an epipen with us at all times.  Traces of nuts can be airborne.  And traces of nuts can be found in any food product which was made in a facility that also processes nuts (virtually all chocolate products and MANY, MANY more).  As a result, my daughter has to be in a peanut/tree nut free classroom and sits at a peanut/tree nut free lunch table that is positioned 25' away from kids whom bring bagged lunches (I am happy to say the school itself serves sunbutter in lieu of peanut butter.  Sunbutter is made from sunflower seeds).  

I urge you to provide peanut/tree nut free airplanes.  I ask that you ban peanut and tree nut products and also anything made in a peanut/tree nut facility in doing this.  I ask that not only do these airplanes not sell these products, but that passengers are not allowed to bring these food products on the plane ride.  I don't ask that you ban all planes.  I urge you to require some planes (perhaps two per airline) be free of peanuts, tree nuts and traces of these nuts, thus banning products made in a nut facility.  Traces of peanuts and nuts can be found if thorough cleaning is not done in the airplane and also, in the ventilation system.  That is why, I feel, a certain number of planes per airline need to be peanut and nut free in every sense.  This will allow us to request such a nut free flight and fly with no worries.

Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to having my daughter be a passenger in an airplane in the future and as it stands right now, the government regulations simply are not stringent enough to allow us to do so.

Respectfully submitted,

I would love for the DOT, to not limit this to peanuts, but all nuts.  Tree nuts can prove to have as serious anaphylactic reactions as peanuts and are found to be on the rise just like peanut allergies.  

My vote would be to not serve any products containing any nuts in them whatsoever.  I've see the airlines serve other nuts than peanuts on airlines.  You will find it difficult to find a peanut or nut package that doesn't also have a warning on it for the other nuts.  

The buffer zone doesn't do much good, since they are still on the plane and many people are contact reactive to peanuts.  Also, when peanuts are open, the peanut dust gets airborne which is also likely to cause a reaction.

Also, people who are eating the peanuts on the plane are also using the toilet facilities and touching general seats or areas that the allergic person might also touch.  Once the allergic person comes in contact with this dust, it can than cause a reaction.

With so many snacks to choose from in the world, why are peanuts and nuts so important to the airline industry.  Certainly someone can think of another snack that can easily be provided which doesn't cause a catastrophic reaction for some people.

I enjoy having peanuts as a snack on my flights, but if it is a matter of someone near me having a severe allergic reaction, I can forego them.  In response to carrying the appropriate injections if an allergic reaction were to occur - I believe that should be the responsibility of the person with the allergy.  Also, I think this regulation can only go so far - you can't monitor all snacks that people bring on board an aircraft; candy bars, snack crackers, etc a lot of which contain peanut ingredients.

I have a child with a severe life threatening peanut/nuts allergy.  She has previously experienced anaphalaxis.  I have not and will not let her fly on a plane unless all peanuts/nuts are banned on a flight.  The only travel our family does by plane is my husband for business- otherwise we drive- even when it takes 2 days for us (Disney World).  I would love to be able to feel safe and have our family fly for vacations- and since most of our family is at least one day's long drive away- but the airlines are not cautious and sympathetic to passengers with peanut allergies. My husband and I used to fly at least twice a year prior to our child's diagnosis.  This is life and death and being up in the air is no place to risk having a reaction.  A peanut buffer zone on a plane is a joke considering the plane is a closed in space and the air is recirculated.  Maybe someday things will improve- till then we will continue to drive.",,,,,,,

Unlike other allergies peanut reactions are often severe and life threatening.  Anything done to lower the chance of reaction or lessen its severity is helpful. Our children have peanut allergies and we did not fly until they were five for fear or reactions.",,,,,,,

Her allergy is airborne therefore even the ""trace"" amount of peanut dust on a cup, door knob, in the air, on a flight attendant, on her seat can be fatal.  She has had 3 reactions from airborne peanut particles.  I don't understand why airborne peanut dust need to be measured scientifically for people to understand.  The FDA has implemented food safety laws because they know that peanut dust/protein can go airborne in a room, on a cookie sheet, in an oven...it attaches itself to other things that is why there are such strict labeling laws when it comes to good manufacturing processes.  If the FDA gets this than why not the FAA.  Federal is Federal.  I know a 45 year old father in Spain that died from Shellfish being cooked in a grocery store-that he was unaware of and had a deadly anaphylactic reaction to.  I know a Mother that was cooking eggs and although she knew her little daughter was allergic and couldn't eat them she had no idea that just breathing in the protein could kill her.  The daughter didn't know what hit her when she started to swell and couldn't breathe as she was a toddler.  1 in 17 children under the age of 10 have a life-threatening allergy and peanuts is the highest one and the one that is most likely to be life long.  Please serve pretzels or something else.  If my daughter goes on a plane she can have a life-threatening reaction.  The Epi-pen only lasts 30 minutes which would inconvenience everyone if the plane goes down.  If you don't want to understand that someone can suffocate from what they are breathing in then realize that everything everyone touches in that plane has ""traces of peanuts"" all over it -when they serve it!

My 6 year old daughter has a severe peanut and nut allergy. She has suffered a past anaphylactic reaction to the ingestion of a tiny amount of peanut. We have not flown on any airplanes since her diagnosis due to the risk of exposure and potentially death if she cannot reach a hospital in time. From speaking with her allergist, we understand that a single epinephrine dose may only work for 15 minutes before another is needed. 

Even a tiny amount of peanut protein could cause an allergic reaction if ingested. Therefore, the risks associated with flying on an airplane serving peanuts are high. Studies have shown that peanut protein does become airborne when packages are opened in a pressurized environment.

We would be most comfortable flying under the first proposed option.  We would also consider flying under the second proposed option. However, I would suggest that if this were implemented, the amount of advance notice be clearly defined and should include changes due to flight cancellations. Additionally, it would be recommended to also have airlines wipe down seats in the row the peanut allergic individual would be sitting in. This would reduce the chance of children accidentally getting protein on their hands and accidentally ingesting it.

The third option of a peanut free buffer zone would not be acceptable due to air circulating throughout the plane. Doing nothing should not be an option.

I would not have concerns if peanuts were not served on airplanes but individuals were allowed to bring peanut products on board – especially if a one row buffer zone was implemented. Attempting to ban anyone from bringing these products on board during a flight would not be practical.

I appreciate the difficulties that airlines can have in not serving peanuts as they are very cheap. However, I believe the lives and safety of individuals with peanut allergies should be of greater importance.  Thank You.",,,,,,,

We have up to this point used only American Airlines because they do not serve peanuts but once we were on a non-US flight trying to come home that insisted on serving peanuts to the passengers. This was a four hour flight over an isolated area where there were no close hospitals around and we had to take the flight to get home. This happened of course after we had petitioned the flight company (LanCHILE) to not serve nuts on this particular flight. While they promised beforehand not to do it, once we were up in the air they apparently forgot all about this. I can't tell you how difficult this was. The whole plan filled with the smell of peanuts and we sat on pins and needles for the whole four hours hoping our son would not go into anaphalactic shock, like he had already done twice before in the past. Risking the life a child (or an adult) so people can eat a bag of peanuts just doesn't make sense to me. Peanuts/nuts are one of the very few allergies that can cause death in a person if they breath in the oils. I fully support this proposal and hope it becomes law.

I'm a college student with an allergy to the food. My reactions aren't triggered nearly as easily as some -- I can be on a plane with the peanuts and not necessarily die.
But the smell of peanuts makes me understandably uncomfortable. Imagine if you could smell lethal poison in the air -- it might not necessarily kill you, but you can imagine how unpleasent that might be.
Besides, there are plenty of others who will actually die just by inhaling those vapors.
What's really frustrating is that airline peanuts can cause death and discomfort, but they're far from necessary. Airline food is already the subject of widespread ridicule, from daily conversation to stand-up comedy.
Airlines can just as easily serve pretzels -- they aren't any more expensive, they're a similar salty snack, and they don't, y'know, kill people.

Providing a buffer zone in a plane would do absolutely no good at all for a individual with a severe peanut allergy.

The attendants were approx. 10 rows away from us when we realized what they were doing.

For years it has driven me crazy that airlines publish a one way fare and then put, in small print, that the fare is only available if purchased as a round trip.  I am happy that you are trying to prevent this fraudulent behavior.   This is a win-win proposition.  The airlines won't lose any business, but the public interest in full and fair advertising will be better served by changing the conduct.  Thanks again for paying attention to these details!",,,,,,,

When a large number of people open bags of peanuts in an enclosed space such as an airplane, the airborne peanut particles are dangerous to those with peanut allergies and our son had a reaction in just this situation. While in a plane one is trapped with the allergens and trapped without access to medical attention. It is also very hard to properly remove peanut pieces and residue between flights, so it is much safer not to serve them on any flights as all.  As for individuals bringing peanut products on board, at least this is not a large-scale and simultaneous release. This could be handled by individual airlines asking passengers to avoid opening such products when there is a person with peanut allergies on board, such as Jet Blue does, and by the passenger being vigilant to his/her surroundings. We always wipe down our son's arm rests, put napkins on the drop-down tray, look carefully around, and if necessary move him or speak to someone eating peanut products in the vicinity.  A buffer-free zone is helpful but really does not address the issue of air borne particles which cause respiratory distress as well as red, runny, itchy eyes. Yes, all products containing peanuts should be included. As for emergency medication, it is the passenger's responsibility to carry this medication. However, all instructions for epipen injection say to call 911 and to get medical attention immediately after the injection.
Eliminating risk is ideal: any reduction in exposure to this risk is greatly appreciated. Thank you.",,,,,,,

The DOT should consider banning all nuts on public airplanes.  Realizing that passengers could carry their own nuts onto the flight, they could be asked by the airlines to dispose of them.

My son's first allergic reaction occurred on a plane when he was 6 months old.  We didn't even know he had allergies.  We did not have an epi-pen!  So, the comments regarding making a passenger carry an epi-pen only apply to passengers who know they have an allergy.  I would like to suggest that every airline have to carry an epi-pen just like they have to carry other medical supplies.

We always request a nut free or friendly flight, whatever the airline allows.  It is pointless though, because if the airline served peanuts on the last flight, there are always peanuts in between the seats and all over the floor.  We have had to give our son multiple doses of antihistamines on certain flights, especially if the seats are cloth.  And, I always wipe down the seats, tray tables, windows, walls, etc with a damp cloth before we ever sit down.  

We only fly if it is the only way to get where we have to go.

We have experienced that the airlines seem to have a complete lack of understanding of the real dangers.  On a flight last month, the airline served tree nuts, even though we had requested a nut free flight.  The stewardess asked if I had an epi-pen, and when I responded positively, she thought there was no problem.  If an epi-pen is administered, it is a last resort.  THE AIRPLANE SHOULD LAND IMMEDIATELY AND HAVE AN AMBULANCE WAITING TO TAKE THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE HOSPITAL!  (Please feel free to consult any food allergist to confirm.)  So, requiring passengers to carry their own epi-pen is not going to help any passenger if the epi-pen is used.

Thanks for letting the general public comment.",,,,,,,

We have him re-tested each year with the hopes of outgrowing this allergy. Unfortunately, he has not outgrown it. This causes large amounts of time, care, preparedness; not to mention, extreme anxiety. This is especially true with flying. Up until now, we have braved the flights but not without a lot of fear and anxiety. Although we bring our own snacks and don't allow him to eat what the airline has provided, there is still a huge risk. Peanuts and tree nuts are very oily so any person eating them on an airplane that then touches the seat, tray and other places can leave traces of the nut which can then cause a severe reaction in a person allergic to these nuts. As a result, I am nervous the whole flight and have contemplated not flying again because of the risk. Additionally, because my son is so young he can very easily pick something up off the floor and put it into his mouth, or simply touch it and if it is a nut, can lead to a reaction. And we know how kids are constantly exploring every nook and cranny.  I have a strong opinion about banning all peanuts and tree nuts from flights. Even a buffer free zone is not completely safe as the nuts can drop and enter the buffer free zones. This is also why only limiting nuts on flights with an allergic person can be dangerous. There is no guarantee that pieces of the peanuts and tree nuts or traces of the oils have been completely cleaned from prior flights. Please consider banning all peanuts and tree nuts from all flights so that everyone can experience a safe, worry-free experience. Thank you for reading my comments and fears.",,,,,,,

The computer had given my seat to a passenger whose plane had not yet arrived at the airport.  Delta allowed other passengers to board the flight without a boarding pass.  Isn't that against all Homeland Security regulations and policies?  Delta's service is much worse than Northwest's ever was, and perhaps this merger was not a good idea.

As a parent of a child with peanut allergies, flying is incredibly stressful. It seems an easy solution to serve non-peanut snacks and avoid having to make changes to flights. It also seems it would save money on just changing the type of snacks as opposed to having to have special processes to both manage requests for an allergy safe flight, changing procedures, taking time to make announcements and create a buffer zone (potentially changing seats of passengers), etc. which all can cost time. Additionally, if someone were to have a reaction and a plane make an emergency landing these are much more real financial costs/burdens on the airline. All which could have been easily avoided. 

While it is more difficult to manage what people are carrying on board, at least knowing nothing is openly being served allows peace of mind for many. It is much simpler to then create that buffer zone when there is an allergy request than ahving to change everyone's snack.

If not Epi-Pens, then definitely Benadryl. Benadryl has saved my daughter's life when otherwise she would have had anaphylactic reactions. Benadryl is not affected by heat/cold as Epi-Pens are. It may be difficult to keep Epi-Pens at the right temp and up-to-date. 3) Items containing peanuts should not be served on board (Peanut Butter sandwich, crackers, etc.) because of cross-contamination issues.

My son has had four episodes of anaphylactic shock in his brief life.  When we have gone to great expense to book the most convenient flights on peanut-free airlines, we have gotten bumped onto a completely different carrier who refused to accommodate our request not to serve peanuts.  This resulted in massive delays and stress, and our plight was met with something far short of sympathy from the airlines, despite the fact that we had been involuntarily rebooked onto an airline that served peanuts from an airline that did not serve peanuts.  The over $5,000 we had spent for our cross-country tickets resulted in us spending nearly 24 hours in various airports with two small children pleading for sympathy and understanding.  Our family is a large family spread across the United States;  air travel has always been a way of life for us but given the difficulties we have encountered finding airlines that can accommodate us we have not traveled by air in the last 2 years.  The risk to our son posed by flying on an aircraft where peanuts are served is too great;  as difficult as it is to understand for the non-allergic individual, an aircraft coated in an invisible film of peanut residue is as dangerous to our son as a ticking bomb.  The relative low cost (financial, commercial, logistical) of removing peanuts from the permitted menu of commercial carriers would have a huge return:  it would allow thousands, if not millions, of individuals and their families to fly again without fear of a severe allergic reaction.

We have made a lot of progress in bringing awareness on this issue to the mass population however, airline passengers still seem  uneducated on this issue.  During my travels, I have heard people say, then just don't feed airloine food to your child if he's allergic to peanuts.  They don't understand the issue of cross-contamination of all the seats, seatbelts, windows, tray tables, bathroom doors, faucets, etc.  An allergic reaction can occur after touching any one of those surfaces -- up at 30,000 feet high --where there is no emergency room!!  I have personally seen peanuts on the floor under my daughter's seat when I have travelled.  I often get weird stares as I pre-board and clean my daughter's seat area with a wet wipe.  It would be a nice start if peanuts were banned -- although all nuts should be considered as nust is something everyone can do without while travelling.  They can many different snack choices instead like pretzels, cookies, chips, crackers, etc.  Thank you to the government for attempting this major step.   Another thing to realize is that food allergies are already protected under the federal disability act so taking this step only seems logical.  Please don't let any airline or insensitive people stop you from doing the right thing in protecting all consumers - even the allergic ones.",,,,,,,

Air travel is extremely complicated and stressfull for families and individuals dealing with this.  Fortunately, my child is not airborne allergic-but it is a major issue.

Before you even get on the plane, you need to have packed your own ""safe snacks"", antibacterial wipes and hand sanitizer in abundance- this is not including at least 2 Epi-Pens.  Every surface that my child will come in contact with on that plane needs to be wiped down from the tray, to the seats, to the seat belts. If he wishes to use the bathroom I also go with him and wipe the handles.

What most people don't understand-these allergies are life-threatening and totally avoidable.  If my child somehow ingests this-without the proper medical help-he will die.  And 30,000 feet up in the air does not give enough time to save his life.  One Epi-Pen buys him about 10-15 min until the next one needs to be administered-after that he needs a hospital.

Peanuts are not a necessary part of travel.  Isn't it the responsibility of the airlines to ensure the safety of everyone? And it's bordering discrimination to choose peanuts over people.  Why should allergic persons be forced to find alternative ways to travel?

It seems to me the issue is easily cleared up-there are dozens of alternatives to peanuts.  Pretzels, crackers, etc.  That's a small price to pay for someone's life.  And what about the adult who has to travel for business?  If they are allergic-airborne or otherwise-how will the airlines protect that person.

I am asking that you consider changing to the rules-at the VERY least to a peanut free buffer zone-or even banning them altogether.

Thank you for your consideration in this matter.",,,,,,,

It started out with a minor reaction where I would get hives around my mouth. The doctor was hoping I'd outgrow it, but I didn't. Each time I was exposed to peanuts the reaction became more severe. By the time I was in college, I needed to carry an epi-pen with me at all times, and unfortunately had to use it a couple of times. Just recently I was flying back from my honeymoon and the stewardess asked everyone if they would refrain from eating anything with peanuts during the flight because there was a passenger, (myself), who had a severe allergy to peanuts. We weren't halfway through our flight when my husband saw a man sitting two rows in front of us, trying to hide his peanut butter cups from the stewardess, while he ate them one by one. When the stewardess went over there to talk to him, the man put up a fight. While he refused to hand over his candy, he finally agreed to not eat it the rest of the flight. While thankfully I did not have to used my epi-pen on that flight, the panic attack I had because of the man refusing to put them away was scary enough. I share this with you, because it made me very dismayed that society is at the point where they only care about themselves and refuse to look after their neighbor. While this may seem so trivial to a lot of people, the truth of the matter is, while to some needing to eat peanuts immediately is just a personal preference, to others, including myself, it is a life and death situation. While eating peanuts may be a ""right"" to some people, to others it can be the death of them. I just moved from Wisconsin to Texas and my husband and I drove down here. The thought of having to get on a plane ride to go back home to visit my friends and family, absolutely terrifies me. I beg you to advocate for the banning of peanuts on all airplanes.

Dear Sirs:
I am not in favor of banning peanuts from commercial flights in the United States.  Peanuts are a healthy snack and a good source of protein - and the only free protein snack currently available on commercial flights.
I also do not believe Airlines should be responsible for providing Epi-pens to customers who have peanut allergies.  Individuals with analyphylactic response to bee stings are instructed to carry an Epi-Pen at all times.  This individual responsibility should be applicable to all individuals with known anaphylactic allergic reactions. 
How would peanuts become air-borne in an airplane other than with the use of a peanut oil cooking spray?  The other obvious question is why would a customer bring an aerosol on board a plane and then spray it in the air?
Please do not apply another federal regulation to US citizens and allow US citizens to take individual responsibility for managing their health.
Thank you

As my wife is allegic to highly allegic to caffeine, ban the use of all caffeine in drinks or foods.

Where does the insanity end.

Again, individuals need to take what safe guards are appropriate for them in the situation they place themselves.

I would prefer the FAA exert its efforts for true passenger safe guards of airport security, screening and aircraft maintainance, rather than what food is or is not served on an airline.  Let's get real!",,,,,,,

My son has a class 6 peanut allergy (100+ IGE) which is the highest level that is measured for peanuts.   In school in Colorado, he will have a 504 plan that is covered and protected by the Federal Disabilities Act and this plan will be used to protect him inside the classroom.  My son has had an anaphylactic reaction to the peanut protein after touching a surface and then touching his eye.  What type of responsibility is the transportation industry going to take if a reaction takes place on the airlines.    
It is imperative that the airlines create a safe and consistent place for sufferers of peanut allergies.  I am a frequent traveler with over 500,000+ frequent flier miles on many airlines and have reached out to 4+ airlines to determine the safety of traveling with my 4 year old with allergies.  I have not received consistent information from the airline industry and was told by one airline that they only clean the plane one time at the end of the day. 
Schools all over the country are making changes to cover kids with allergies and I don't understand why the airline cannot select a safe snack that doesn't compromise the health and safety of allergy sufferers.  My son has allergies to 13 foods but the only contact issues is tree nuts and peanuts.  Why can't these items be restricted on planes so that the fear is removed.  There have been studies showing the impact of peanuts and I don't know why these cannot be used by the DOT.  Air Canada has made a policy to try to protect peanut allergies.  Is the peanut lobby that powerful?  There are many, many snacks that can be substituted for the same price.  Please advise how this situation is going to be handled.  Thank you.  Susie Furman",,,,,,,

As an adult of over 30 years I have seen a gradual increase in the number of people inflicted with it over the last 20 years.

As an individual that has to travel via airplane for his job, I have to take additional precautions when flying on a carrier that serves peanuts. I have been able to avoid this for the last few years due to being selective as to which carrier and/or flight I am selecting. 

Unfortunately with the acquisition by Delta of Northwest Airlines and my location in Minneapolis, this has become nearly impossible.

My allergy is not reactive to airborne particles on their own. But, I have suffered mild allergic reactions due to inhaling large quantities of the dust that are present. This becomes an oral exposure due to the quantities. Because of the configuration of airline ventilation systems, the idea of a buffer zone is one that is fundamentally flawed. The costs related to having to react to a life-threatening emergency in the air certainly outweigh any costs that would be encountered by NOT serving peanuts.

When the question is asked what if someone brings a pack of peanuts on the plane on their own, I would counter that having one or two bags opened is much more reasonable than having 200 bags opened on a 757.

Airlines should have to either not serve peanuts at all or be able to remove them from a flight. Because of the lack of predictability in air travel, the idea of always being able to notify an airline ahead of time is somewhat impossible. What if I were to get bumped from my scheduled flight?

I am normally not one that is a fan of restricting others from doing things that they have a right to do. But eating a peanut isn't really a necessity of life for others, especially for the timeframe that they spend on a plane. But for those of us that are sufferers of severe allergies, that individual peanut has significantly more meaning.

We flew Jet Blue in May, and it was horrible.  I filed a complaint with them, and they did nothing.  My son, age 11, has severe, potentially life threatening food allergies to peanuts and treenuts.  I was told when I booked the flight that no nuts would be served, and I did write down the employee name, number, etc.  When we got on the plane, they were serving treenuts!!!  Our big trip to Disney was ruined.  My son wound up having a reaction, and had such a severe sore and itchy throat after the flight, that he didn't even want to go to the parks.  We would up at the emergency medical  care center, and incurred medical expenses, which the airline carrier could care less about, and he and I also missed out on part of our once in a life time trip to Disney, and the costs associated with the park entrance, meal plans, etc.  I'm not planning to fly again any time soon, as it was such a bad experience for us, on so many levels.  The airlines can say one thing, then do another, and when my son has a problem, and misses out on his trip, and I have to pay medical expenses, no one cares.  Something should be done about this.  I DID report this to the airline, but they won't tell you about it.  I'm glad you have the open comment section, so please count us in your totals of people having an anaphylactic reaction due to airborne nut proteins on an aircraft.  I have all the medical documentation to back it up.

On our six previous flights, prior to departure, we have meticulously washed all surrounding surfaces with Lysol wipes and have placed disposable seat covers on the seat backs and bottoms.  We have place gloves on our children and even facemasks.  We have advised the flight crew of the severe allergies, but they cannot enforce a ""no peanuts"" rule on flights.  All around us were other passengers who were sold trail mix, were given peanuts as a snack or brought their own peanut-containing snack.  Both children during the flight experienced hives on their body as well as swelling of the face (eyes and lips) and nausea which are the beginning signs of anaphylaxis.  Even if a flight were to be pronounced peanut-free just for that flight only, the amount of peanut crumbs that can be found on all surfaces and on the floor and in the ashtrays/seatback holders is amazing and very disappointing.  You cannot be peanut-free within a 'safe zone' or for just one flight with the severity of anaphylaxis reactions that peanut allergic persons can experience.  Flights have to be completely peanut free permanently.  Unfortunately, the lives of our family and countless others are restricted to travel only by car due to the unwillingness of the airlines to ban peanuts on flights.  Please reconsider this and understand that this is not just a convenience request, but rather a request to return to the air again without the fear of death on a flight or soon after arrival at our destination.",,,,,,,

This requires a lot of work and diligence, especially when flying.  We cannot just choose the least expensive flight.  We have to contact the airlines for their allergen policies, which vary by whether you look on their web site or call and speak to someone and who you speak to.  And then it has to be an airline that doesn't serve peanuts or tree nuts at all as snacks because a plane full of people all opening pressurized packets at once could cause a reaction.  And airlines offering to not serve them for our flight would not work because residue would be on the seats and in the ventilation system.

I completely understand the concerns regarding peanut allergies and serving them in enclosed spaces/flights. I fully support banning peanuts on all flights. I was on a flight recently where I reached into a the pocket to pull out the ""flight emergency exit folder"" and pulled out a few stray peanuts with it. After trying not to panic and hyperventilate....I was able to wash my hands quickly, use my ventolin and take my antihistamine and it kept  the anaphylaxis at bay, this time. I live every day trying to be vigilant but not become too paranoid so that I can enjoy life without constant fear. 

However if you start considering banning one item such as peanuts....where do you stop? Why just peanuts.....I understand it is a popular snack served on many flights. But there are other foods served to which  a number of people may also have an anaphylatic reaction. Are you also going to ban those foods? 

 I have a life threatening allergy to peanuts. I am also  anaphylaxic to shellfish and kiwi fruit. A few other mild allergies round out the mix just to keep life interesting. I travel with a number of epipens....3 when I fly. It ultimately is my responsibility to ensure I keep myself safe and to take precautions to ensure that. Unless you have someone on the flight that is specially trained to use the epipen and to deal with the outcome of same then I strongly recommend you leave epipen usage to the passenger. It is a public transportation system....not an ambulance. 

My feeling is if you are going to invest time and money into developing a document that outlines a proposed process to handle peanut allergies, wouldn't it be due diligence to create a document that handles all allergies equally? It is a very difficult area to delve into. I do not envy the position you are in. 

These are my opinion alone and do not reflect anyones else's thoug",,,,,,,

No one wants a severe medical emergency 30,000 feet in the air and it would increase your customers.  Currently, we don't even consider flying as it is too risky of an endeavor.  My child is one to which mere contact and inhalation has triggered a severe reaction.  The last time we flew, we flew with an airline that served tree nuts.  The captain had members of his crew come out and talk to us, find out if we had all necessary medical emergency medicine and inquire if we had flown with them since they started handing out the tree nuts (which we hadn't).  It was not a good spot to be in, felt as if we weren't going to be allowed to board.  With such a ban, families like mine would not go through that, and we would not be stranded or told different stories.  There needs to be a unified way to deal with this ""hidden"" disability.

We have two grandchildren with severe peanut allergies, as well as other allergies, but the peanut allergy is the only one that is life threatening.

Our grandchildren are not able to fly Delta Airlines, which is the major airline for Minneapolis/St. Paul, because Delta has chosen to support Georgia's major crop.

I was diagnosed with peanut allergies that result in anaphalytic shock in the early 1970's.  No one had heard of it then.  It then was found out that I was not only allergic to peanuts but all nuts, legumes, including soybean and tree nuts.  The reactions can result in death.  

I took an American Flight in April.  Eight flights,  in fact, all together round trip.  I was horrified that even with the promises of a ""buffer zone"" that the flight crew served nuts.  Two of the planes were too smalll to even concider a true buffer zone.  I took all prevenitive medicines that I could and also wore a mask but found the whole experience frightening and humiliating.   Especially when I was told if I didn't feel safe I could exit the plane and was called the ""nuts girl"" by the terminal staff.

The airline also had not concidered cross contamination from other flights.  Peanut bags were everywhere in seat pockets which meant that buttons, tray tables, air vent, and seat belt all had been touched and now posed a threat to me.  If I touched one of those things and then itched my eyes or nose a severe reaction could occur.  

I dont believe that any nuts should be served on planes.  The recycled air can cause wheezing and possible shock to those of us with airborn reactions.  The possibility of cross contamination is staggering due to the amount of surfaces that would have to be cleaned after each flight for tactile reactions that cause hives and also breathing probllems.  

Avoiding eating nuts is much easier than avoiding smelling them or touching something that touched them.  Just avoid it all together and not take any chances with the lives of our children and people like me.   We want to go places and be safe and sound just like everyone else.  Serve fruit and pop.

Over the years, as a parent and advocate I have desperately tried to work with the airlines' current policies and procedures regarding air travel with peanut allergic children.  Each time I have been seriously disappointed!  Although I called ahead and followed the airlines notification process to request that no peanuts be served on our flight, 90% of the time the flight crew had no idea what I was talking about.  To compensate, the crew would often offer to not serve peanuts to our row but that does not keep my children safe from harm.  What proved to me that the airlines are not taking this issue seriously was when we were offered pretzels that were ""processed with peanuts"" as an alternative to peanuts.  While safer for my children to come into contact with, these pretzels are still not safe for my children to ingest.  With the declining economy and increased fuel costs I understand that airlines have to make business decisions based on the bottom line but these decisions should never be at the risk to a child's life.  The fact is that airplane interiors are rarely cleaned and never thoroughly cleaned.  As a result of observing peanuts in the seat and/or on the floor around my familiy's seats, I consistently have to clean the tray tables, arm rests, window area, floor etc. myself.  Please Help!  We are not talking about a child having a few hives.  We are talking about witnessing a child suffocate to death.  I carry 4 doses of Epinephrin for each of my children.  Optimally, each dose can give them up to 15 minutes of breathing time before a second dose is needed.  How fast can a pilot make an emergency landing?  How much money will that cost the airlines?  And what will the cost be to human life?  This is a very serious issue and the airline industry must take responsibility for the safety of their peanut allergic passengers.",,,,,,,

While we have travelled frequently with him without incident, we know what a relief it would be not to have to worry about this allergen. We realize we cannot eliminate all allergens, but why do airlines feel they need to serve peanuts as a snack? In fact, many airlines have eliminated serving snacks altogether as they cut costs and services. Reducing the peanut risk across all the airlines, would be beneficial to us and the millions of others who suffer from allergies. We, also, realize there are numerous allergen and asthma triggers. If a complete ban is unlikely, uniform guidelines for all the airlines, allowing a person with food allergies requesting no peanuts be served during the flight, is essential.

I believe their should be flights that are offered for people with allergies including but not limited to peanuts.  This is no different then the privileges made available to anyone with a disability or limitation of sorts.  As we give our children and family members with these allergies the best of a normal life as possible that should include flying.  There should not be a fear or us having to drive everywhere and not be able to fly internationally because we cannot be safe guarded on a plane.  That we have to fear our children may die because we have to serve nuts to the passengers, last I checked nuts are expensive maybe we should resort to crackers instead much more economical.  We accomodate all types of disabilities and limited issues for the young and old in the country this should be no different , an allergy free or nut free flight should be available to us.  The DOT could regulate this and make it a rule or at least if notified in advance the flight is obligated to not serve nuts when a allergic passenger is flying.  With no rule being in fact the realistic but sad truth is that my son would die because an epipen gives us 20 minutes at best and that is not always enough time to land and get medical attention, so until then we will not fly.

Some flights make announcements, some remove offending allergens from that flight, some say they won't do anything.  Another problem is that when passengers choose carriers that don't serve peanuts, sometimes the carrier merges with another and adopts that other airline's practices or an airline changes it policy.  I booked a flight with a no-peanut policy and that airline merged with another between the time I booked and the time my family flew.  In that time, there was a change in policy.  Nowhere was there a record of my child's allergy, although when I phonedr, they claimed it was clearly on file.  Communication is often lacking from the reservations area to the flight personnel.  We travel a lot and have had many problems with policy changes and inaccurate flight information.  I select only carriers that don't serve peanuts and nuts, but there have been several problems.  I train educators and bus drivers and have been surprised at the number of anecdotal stories of children reacting to airborne allergens.  A study was done by MIT(?) several years ago about peanut particles in the air ventilation.  I know many families who don't fly because of their fear of a reaction in the air.  I understand people not liking the idea of a ban, but I also understand the fear that parents have when thinking about air travel.  People with anaphylaxis don't have a choice about their condition and should have the right to safe travel.  Passengers should be able to go without peanuts for a few hours (just like those who smoke must do without cigarettes for the duration of their flight).  The initial resistance would soon become acceptance.  Most resistance comes when presented as a ban; that people cannot do what they want.  Instead, present it as the airline industry wants to be accessible to all and will stop having peanuts on flights.  Ask for people's cooperation/help.",,,,,,,

I wish that all products containing any form of peanuts (including oils, etc) and other allergens be banned from airplanes. Especially if a passenger requests an allergy free flight.  I have not been able to travel by air for the past several years due to severe airborne peanut and nut allergies (plus other allergies).  Airlines tell us that they won't announce that a person has a fatal food allergy, but that we are welcome to fly at our own risk.  I have missed out on a lot of celebrations, graduations and family vacations.

To my knowledge, Delta is the only airline that continues to serve peanuts.  Other airlines have recognized the severity of this allergy and have chosen to no longer serve them.  I realize that airlines cannot guarantee a peanut free flight, however, eliminating the distribution of them will help reduce the threat tremendously.  When Northwest was it's own airline, they did not serve peanuts and they asked passengers on board to not open or consume peanut products.  That was so helpful!  However, Delta has merged with NWA and they continue to serve peanuts. I have a 16 year old daughter with this life threatening allergy.  Until you live with this threat, I don't think it can be truly understood.   In my opinion, Delta executives don't truly understand this allergy.  My feeling is that they are only concerned with the peanut farmers in Georgia, their home base.
I obtained the following information from Food Allergy and Asthma Foundations:
1.  Peanut allergies are the most common cause of death due to foods.
2.  More than 3 million people in the US are allergic to peanuts and tree nuts.
3.  Food allergies account for 35%-50% of all anaphylactic shock.
4.  From 1997 to 2002 peanut allergies doubled in children.

This seems like such a simple request. PLEASE eliminate the serving of peanuts from all airlines.  It's far more manageable to handle a life threatening situation on the ground than 30,000 feet in the air.  There are SO many other options available. Why continue to provide an environment that is potentially life threatening.  This is a safety issue.  Just like checking the tires of the plane.  I'm sure you would have many more comments if people were aware of this proposal.  However, this is not something most people go looking for.  Please help the more than 3 million people in the US and their families travel safer.

I offered to buy everyone around us different snacks.  Everyone was very accommodating and just said no to peanuts/nuts. 

We have to wash down the seats before she can sit on the airplane and she is scared even to go to the bathroom for fear of touching something that has peanut/nut residue.  

Until the government passes legislation with respect to serving peanut/nuts on planes (of course the peanut farmers have a huge say in how the government reacts to any legislation) the airlines should look at the potential problems.  If someone goes into anaphalatic shock, they would have to divert the plane and land at the nearest airport since the epi-pen is only an immediate help and must be re-administered.   This would cause numerous flight delays which would result in customer disatisfacation, all for the sake of providing a few people with peanut/nuts.  I'm sure most reaonsable people would forego a peanut/nut for the sake of a life, but even so, most would forego the snack if they thought their flight would be delayed or altered.  

I would certainly be more inclined to travel more if I felt that the airlines would adhere to a rule regarding no peanuts/nuts on board their aircraft.",,,,,,,

I am the parent of 3 young children, all with life threatening food allergies to peanuts and/or tree nuts.  I appreciate so much you considering banning (best case scenario) or requiring the safe guarding of my children, and other children and adults alike, while traveling on airplanes.  It is important to consider increasing protection for people with food allergies due to the high risk of exposure to peanuts and tree nuts when on an airplane which can lead to anaphylactic shock and death.  In many cases, organizations/companies/government takes a reactive approach to an issue like this.  Does a child really have to die on an airplane before laws are put in place to protect those with food allergies?  This is a great chance to be proactive and ensure that never happens.  In addition, having a food allergy IS considered a medical disability (I'm not just using that word loosely), and banning peanuts and tree nuts on a plane is NOT an unreasonable request for accommodation considering the number of other food products which can be served on airplanes (pretzels, fruit, etc.).
In addition, while I have encountered some airline staff who were kind and willing to help inform fellow passengers of my kid’s allergies, I have also encountered airline staff who have made traveling safe difficult (perhaps they are tired of answering requests of their customers or since it's not the ""law"" or ""company policy/rule"" then they just don't care).  They have made traveling on the plane difficult by threatening to throw me and my kids off a plane because I talk to my neighbors about peanuts and tree nuts upon boarding and request the favor they not be eaten on the plane (of course while offering to buy them something different at the same time).  It’s heart breaking to think someone could have such little consideration for human life.  Official protection regulations from the FAA would require airline employees to do what is necessary to safe guard the allergic passengers, which in turn will help keep all passengers on the air craft safe and ease the minds of so many parents and people who fly with life-threatening food allergies .  
On the other hand, I have never met a stranger who was not willing to keep their peanuts and/or tree nuts in their bag during the flight after I inform them of the health risks it will pose to my children.  My neighbors on the plane are very accommodating and based on my experiences thus far, I do not predict a “No Peanut and Tree Nut” policy will anger passengers or hurt the airline industry in any way.  If anything – it will only make it better as more people dealing with this disability will have more faith in the airline industry and their commitment to keep everyone on board safe.

The numbers of children with nut allergies, fatal nut allergies has been steadily increasing. These children and adults with nut allergies are not able to take a flight, a closed environment, where nuts are being served. There are so many nut free foods available that could be substituted so that everone could safely enjoy the ability and convienence to travel by air. 

An estimated 1.8 million Americans have an allergy to tree nuts. Allergic reactions to tree nuts are among the leading causes of fatal and near-fatal reactions to foods. Tree nuts include, but are not limited to, walnut, almond, hazelnut, coconut, cashew, pistachio, and Brazil nuts. These are not to be confused or grouped together with peanut, which is a legume, or seeds, such as sunflower or sesame.

Like those with peanut allergies, most individuals who are diagnosed with an allergy to tree nuts tend to have a lifelong allergy. 

Please consider making airline travel nut-free. It would not be a hardship to the other travelers, but it would make a hugh difference to those who are afflicted with this food allergy.

When they checked in at the first check point, Amy commented on her severe peanut allergy (as other airlines have requested her to do),  the employee said one moment and disappeared. She returned with Amy's refund and a note saying they could not take her. This was two hours before her flight was to take off on a Friday night. This sensitive young woman was in tears at the treatment, they did not even offer to help her get a flight on another airline. 
I was able to get a flight home for her and her friend the next day at a much greater cost to us (we felt obligated to pay the increase for her friend too). She was crushed. They had to go back to her friends house and make the very long trip to the airport the next day. Then they had to cut their trip short by another day because that was the only return flight they were able to get booking on short notice. 
Please don't let the airlines abuse the situation with loop holes so that they are not inconvenienced. Southwest and Delta have been very good and cooperative about traveling with allergies.
One thing to remember, it is not just airborne particles. I always tell Amy to carry baby wipes to wipe down her tray and armrests as soon as she sits down. I am sure everything is covered in peanut oil from the hands of people who have had any type of peanut snack. She has been flying since she was five months old with no major problems on a plane but we are extremely careful. She carries her own snacks and wipes her hands before eating, etc. You have to think like a detective to cover all of the bases to stay safe. 
Amy carries at least two or more Epi-pens when traveling. Each one gives you about 20 minutes of relief. She also carries Benadryl and Prednisone for long term relief if she has a severe reaction. 
Thanks for any help for allergic people",,,,,,,

One can always complain about what some other passenger has on board that should be banished. Since airlines are already cutting back on food items and now only sell certain items to passengers, the customers should not be restricted from consuming whatever legal food stuff they bring with them or can purchase on board.

I am writing in response to the proposed regulation of peanuts  served on airlines.  My 7-year-old son has severe allergies.  He has anaphalactic reactions to milk, wheat, eggs, and nuts.  His first year was extremely difficult for my husband and I. Benjamin was very sick and we nearly lost him because of the serious extent of his allergies.  The worst part was that we were not sure of all of the allergens that would create a reaction in him.  When he was 5 months old, we took him on an airplane to see a specialist.  During the flight, cheddar-covered pretzels were served.  Benjamin and I did not eat the pretzels, but everyone around us did.  Within a few minutes, my son started crying and vomiting and soon I saw swelling in his face and hands. Luckily, the symptoms subsided in about 45 minutes.  I was shocked and unsure about what had just happened, but when the flight attendant handed out more bags of these pretzels and the reaction was repeated in my son, I knew that what he had experienced was a severe allergic reaction to the milk in the powdered cheddar cheese on the pretzels.  We were still discovering how serious my son's allergies were, so we had no medication to treat him for those reactions that occurred on that flight.  I thank God that my son survived the reactions on that plane, especially because, just a few weeks later, my son had another accidental exposure milk and it required an epi-pen to stop the reaction (this time we were not on an airplane). After that flight, we discovered that Benjamin was also very allergic to peanuts.  It was 5 years before we took him on another airplane. We were very concerned the second time we flew with him because of that first flight.  When we do fly, we must wipe down all surrounding surfaces because of the potential allergens, from peanuts especially, and we carry emergency medications. Flying is always worrisome.

 Please regulate peanuts; it is a life-threatening substance to so many people.",,,,,,,

I hear the critics of this rule -it seems on the surface to overstep-but they clearly don't understand the nature of a peanut allergy- fatal reactions are possible from casual contact.  I did not believe it myself until my child was diagnosed. The contained air system on an airplane is a unique situation.

Response to Airline Passenger Protection

I would like the following to be considered for those that are given Complimentary Travel:  The Complimentary Travel should be transferable.  Should you receive more than one Complimentary Travel Ticket on the same day you have the option of Monetary compensation and or Comp travel tickets.
This option should be given regardless of voluntary or non-voluntarily.
Luggage compensation on luggage that made the flight you were suppose to be on should not be your responsibility should you arrive at a different airport.  I was fly into Orlando but flew into Tampa and it was my responsibility to go to Orlando and get by luggage.  There should be compensation  or the Airline to be responsible in getting you your bags.

I recently had a situation, on 4/25/2101 where I received three round trip complimentary travel tickets.  I fly once a year.  Three tickets is impossible for me to use in one year, so the Airline is making money on my inconvenience.

However, airplanes are a different story.  I have a 6 yr old son who is severely allergic to peanuts amongst other things. The last few times we have flown, despite my boarding and wiping the seats, he has suffered allergic reactions.  He has had sneezing and red, swollen eyes due to the airborne nature of the peanut allergy. Luckily, each time, the reaction responded to antihistamine, but we suffer because we never know about the next time. It could be anaphylaxis which could result in death and certainly, at least, an emergency landing.
I am told ""don't travel on planes"" which would be fine except my family all lives on the opposite coast.  I am told ""carry an epi-pen"" We have 2.  Yet, this is not enough.  We also are penalized on many airlines. When we tell them we have a peanut allergy, we cannot online check-in thus we are forced to wait on the airport line with our smaill children.  Then, some airlines will place the 3 row rule so we have been subject to rude stares from people who were ""unlucky"" to be in a row near us.
I am not asking that people can't bring on board what they like to eat. However, reducing the amount of peanut allergen in the air would be HUGELY beneficial. When there are a myriad of safe snacks out there, why not serve them instead. WHAT IS WRONG WITH PRETZELS??
Please consider our request made on behalf of my family and the over 65 families we know that suffer from food allergies.

One recommendation would be that flights are offered where special details to cleaning occur and certain flights be deemed food free.  Food free would mean no food served or eaten.  This may work best for first flights of the day and shorter destination direct flights. Being able to travel by air would add to our family's quality of life.  Airlines would be wise to consider all options as it is in their best interest, business wise.  We are potential customers, but limited by lack of safe travel options.",,,,,,,

These experiences are a part of life that most people take for granted.  

My son has a peanut allergy.  His blood levels for antibodies are 97 out of 100, so he is extremely allergic. Every time we think about having to get on a plane to visit family, I get a knot in my stomach.  He must carry 2 epi-pens with him at all times.

We have been limited to just a few carriers that take this issue seriously (good for their business!) and they have provided 'buffer zones' along with an announcement pre-flight indicating 'a person with severe nut allergies is within two rows and to kindlly refrain from opening food that contains nuts'.  Granted the likelihood of my son suffering a reaction from a candy bar a row behind him is slim, but a peanut that rolls under his seat can cause anaphylaxis if he were to reach down to get something from his bag, etc.

Most people kindly refrained but as a parent, I worry about the day when someone brazenly ignores the polite request and I'm forced to confront the individual who obviously has no regard to others' conditions.  That could cause a major safety concern in mid-flight as an altercation is sure to follow.  It seems that there are perfectly reasonable substitutes (pretzels?) for which there is not a major allergic population.  As a society, we routinely take steps to protect those that are amongst our most vulnerable (the elderly, handicapped, etc.), can we not extend such civility to those with severe food allergies as well?  Caregivers such as us can make preventative decisions when in the open, general public... but an airplane is an accident waiting to happen in such a confined space.

I had notified the airlines when booking my ticket, when checking in, and when arriving on the plane that I had a SEVERE (life threatening, stop breathing) allergy to nuts, even when they are airborne.  I was assured there would be no nuts on the plane.  the served Honey Nut Cheerios, and I had to spend my flight in the bathroom because that was the only space I could safely breathe.

On the return flight we were informed of the ""no serving nuts 3 rows in front of or in back of me"" rule.  Luckily, I had learned that I can not trust the airlines, and brought a mask.  And luckily it worked . . . . this time.

Honestly - - which is worse press for the airline? Which costs less money for the airline? Me having a bad reaction and dying (or having to get off the plane at an unscheduled stop in order to recieve medical attention)  or simply replacing all nuts on flights with pretzels or some other snack?  Is it really that hard?  Are people really that attached to their peanuts?  I think that airlines should not be allowed to serve peanuts for my saftey, the safety of the many children who can not speak for themselves, and just plain common sense.",,,,,,,

I am allergic to tree nuts and can go into anaphylactic shock from airborne exposure to tree nuts or from accidently eating them. I carry several Epi-Pens at all times. Air travel scares me because I do not know if airlines will serve tree nuts in first/business class or if people next to me will be eating them. Some airlines serve them in meals or sell them. If I inhale fumes from them I may need immediate medical treatment. If that happens, then the plane will have to be diverted.

I have received varying degrees of help and concern with this medical issue from the airlines. Examples: Hawaiian Airlines stopped serving the nuts at my request and made an announcement asking passengers not to eat nuts. Delta did nothing at all. Airlines and passengers DO NOT understand the severity of this issue to some of their fellow passengers and DO NOT understand that it can result in death. 

They also do not understand that a severe reaction will most likely result in their plane being diverted and their losing many hours of their vacation or trip. 

This is not a ""majority rules"" issue. This issue requires government regulation to protect the minority against the majority. PLEASE ban ALL nuts, peanuts and tree nuts, from flights. If you only ban peanuts, the airlines will just switch to tree nuts, and you will continue to have this problem.

I also represent the Mississauga Anaphylaxis Group.
Out of consideration for the safety of our families at 35,000 feet in the air - far from medical care, we ask you to please give serious consideration to removing peanuts/nuts from all airlines and replacing it with a safer snack.
At the very least, please suspend serving/selling of peanut/nut products and request passengers not bring out peanut/nut products for the duration of the flight when an allergic passenger identifies themselves to the crew, although many people do not disclose on a plane.
A buffer zone at 35,000 feet is not a safe solution. I took a flight at Christmas time where a family brought peanut butter sandwiches on board. Peanut butter is messy and could be spread to door knobs seats, etc. Often people bring on bags of nuts. They can fall on the seats and be picked up and eaten by a young child.

It is just good business sense to make the airlines accessible to as many people as possible.

Peanut/nuts account for the majority of severe food-related allergic reactions. 

Peanut allergy has grown by 250% over 11 years for reasons no one fully understands.

63% of food related anaphylaxis deaths were due to peanuts/nuts.
 
12% of the time epinephrine isn't enough to stop a severe anaphylactic episode - avoidance is critical.
 
1/3 of patients with peanut allergy are also allergic to at least one tree nut.
 
30 - 50 % of peanut/nut allergic are also asthmatic.  The asthma factor adds to the critical component.

Thank you for your consideration.
We need to look out for each other - until the doctors can find the cause/cure for life threatening allergies.

There are different degrees of allerrgy sensitivies. Some individuals are allergic only when eating the food. Others may experience contact allergies. The most life threatening food allergy reaction occurs with airborne paticles stimulating an allergic reaction. 

Many patients with penaut allergies actually have respiratory compromise. Airplanes use recyled air. Patients who have severe respiratory compromise from exposure to peanuts may experience life threatenng reactions even if they arer not directly near a person comsuming peanuts. I believe a ban on peanuts is a vital safetly precaution to protecting the health of these indivduals. 

My daughter has allergies to peanuts and eggs. I speak from both a personal and professional level. I hope the DOT reviews these valid safety concerns and chooses to stop potentially life threatening conditions from occuring on airlines from unnecessary exposures.

He is 9 years old and has been allergic to peaunts since infancy.

Peanuts are NOT a necessary snack on an airplane flight.  There are plenty of other snack options available.

The safest environment for my son is one without peanuts.  Though he does eat in the school cafeteria, he avoids sitting near someone with a peanut product.  Should he have a reaction while at school, he can easily be removed from the environment, and he has immediate access to an ambulance and emergency services at a hospital.

On an airplane, should he have a reaction to peanuts, he cannot be removed from the environment and he has no access to emergency treatment.  The airplane would have to be diverted to the closest airport and all passengers would be inconvenienced.

The best thing that airlines can do is to remove all peanut products from the plane.  Not having peanuts on board for the peanut allergic person while still having them available on other flights does not eliminate the problem of peanut residue.  The seat and tray table could potentially have peanut residue that the peanut allergic person could react to.  Having a buffer zone does not eliminate the potential of reacting to airborne peanut dust from opening a peanut package.

As I stated before, peanuts are NOT a necessary snack.  Peanuts are life threatening to an allergic individual.  It is very easy to remove this threat from the plane by not serving peanut products.",,,,,,,

A close friend of mine is deathly allergic to peanuts and all tree nuts. I plead to see all nuts banned from flights so that my friend and I can fly safely. Many are severely allergic to peanuts and tree nuts, including airborne reactions. Also, people allergic to peanuts are told by their allergists to avoid tree nuts too, in an effort to avoid sensitization and to increase the odds of outgrowing the allergy. It would be terrible to see peanuts banned but tree nuts provided as the substitute, since nuts are processed in shared facilities resulting in cross-contamination. 

I strongly prefer the option of banning the serving of peanuts and ALL peanut products in ingredients lists, on ALL flights. It is impossible to adequately clean all surfaces from floor to ceiling in a plane of all traces of peanut protein, including the fabric on the seats. It is too life-threatening to my friend and others in her situation to be in a plane covered in ""nut dust"".

I suggest that when an allergic passenger is on a flight, an announcement be made on board asking all passengers to please not open any products with nut ingredients during the flight due to a passenger on board with life-threatening nut allergies.

There have been a few scientific studies on allergic reactions on airlines, which are:

Self-reported allergic reactions to peanut on commercial airliners

On its reservation website, the fare is clearly identified as a First Class (FC) fare.

The reservation system shows that FC upgrades are not available, as the ticket is already a FC ticket and FC seat assignments are immediately available.

The reservation and itinerary the passenger receives shows the ticket to be a FC ticket.

The boarding pass shows the ticket to be a FC ticket.

The passenger has asked for, selected, paid for, and received a FC ticket and seat assignment, typically paying a premium over the coach class fare that was alternatively available.

However, in the event of irregular operations (for example a mechanical or weather-related cancellation) Delta agents, if they cannot accommodate the passenger in FC on another flight, tell the passenger that the ticket is actually a coach ticket with a complementary upgrade to FC.

The passenger who was sold a ticket marketed by Delta to be a FC ticket, ends up in coach, often without a refund in the fare difference between the ""A"" FC fare they purchased and the cost of the coach service they received.

Please stop this deceptive marketing practice.

These itineraries are marketed under a single flight number, but involve a connection at some intermediary hub.  The airline seeks an assumption on the part of the passenger that the flight is either a non-stop, or that both flight segments will be on the same plane.

In reality, there is often a change of planes at the intermediate airport.  The passenger's first flight may be delayed, and he may feel assured that he will make his connection (since the flight number is the same) only to find that his connection flight has already left before he reaches the  intermediary hub.

This is simply a deceptive marketing tactic on the part of the airlines, seeking to gain an advantage in some commercial reservation systems, which give more prominence in the display of non-stop and direct flights.

The concept of a ""direct"" flight"" offers no advantage to the passenger, and may actually pay a higher fare for the ""direct"" flight.

Further, the airlines use this as a means of denying full frequent flier program credit to the passenger.  The passenger actually flies from A to B to C, and the airline only credits them for the lesser mileage from A to C, and for only one flight segment rather than the two flown.",,,,,,,

It is not uncommon to experience a delay that is attributable to an airline action or inaction, only to have a subsequent (and often appreciably shorter) delay occur to due weather or ATC isues.

The tendency on the part of some airlines is to report the delay as having been caused by the last event in the sequence.  For example, a four hour mechanical delay which leaves the plane on the ground until a thunderstorm comes through, is classified as a weather delay.

The advantage of this to the airline is that they can avoid the costs of the customer service features they have promised the passengers in the event of an airline-caused delay.  For example, they avoid the cost of providing hotel accommodation to passengers that have been stranded by the mechanical delay that (opportunistically, for the airline) extended into a further weather-related delay.",,,,,,,

The purchaser is then only offered Coach Class transportation, even if space for First Class transportation is available, with the explanation that the fare purchased is actually a Coach Class fare with a contingent upgrade to First Class, valid only on the flight for which the fare was originally purchased.

In reference to the following Docket;
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
Office of the Secretary
14 CFR Parts 234, 244, 250,253, 259, and 399
[Docket No. DOT-OST-2010-0140]
RIN 2105-AD92

Our Son, John Dunn, has life threatening food allergies to peanuts and tree nuts. We face many challenges daily in order to keep John safe. Life is full of negotiations, beginning at home, grocery shopping, school life, church, play grounds, birthday parties, sporting events, restaurants and travel. We have spent countless hours educating ourselves and those who come in contact with John and his disability. At school, John has a comprehensive 504 plan to keep him safe and eligible to participate in his academic career equal to students without this disability. However, one very difficult area to negotiate is air travel with John and his life threatening food allergies.

Our family has been able to fly 3 times with John, two times on Air Tran and once on Aer Lingus. All other attempts to fly on other commercial airlines were deemed unsafe by us and our Physician standards. John can not be on an airline that serves peanuts or tree nuts (tree nuts are usually served in 1st class). The three row buffer zone does not work for John, if the remainder of the aircraft is opening a nut product the nut particles are still being sent out into the air and this is unsafe for John. We have been misinformed on several occasions by other airlines; we have called these airlines numerous times in advance and get conflicting reports on what is served, protocol on how food allergies are handled and we have had to cancel trips ultimately resulting in negotiations to get a refund on one occasion. 

Our family is thrilled that the DOT is considering travelers who suffer with peanut allergies. We urge you to consider in Docket No.DOT-OST-2010-0140 RIN 2105-AD92, adding Tree Nuts to be included in the language of the docket. We would also like to request the elimination of serving peanuts and tree nuts from all air travel to be considered in the docket. There are many safe alternatives to snacks that do not include peanuts and tree nuts that could be served on flights. We would like accommodations for those who suffer with this medical disability to ensure access to safe air travel conditions, easier access to regulated guidelines and accountability for these standards placed on the airline carriers.

We appreciate your consideration on these matters, and our requests for additionally details and inclusion for tree nuts to be added to the docket.

That should include foods that contain nuts, and foods that are processed in a factory that has nuts.

It would be possible for a person to have a serious allergic  reaction during a flight.  If not treated immediately could cause death.  People can have reactions from breathing in nuts, or contact.  An example would be if someone was eating nuts in their seat, and the next passenger sat down not knowing that there were nuts previously present.  If nut particles were dropped on the seat, arm rest, tray, it could come in contact with the allergic person.  

There are many other foods that could be eaten on airplanes.  If no smoking can be enforced, then I'm sure that no nuts could easily be enforced.  Please proceed with this law.  No nuts or nut products served or brought on airplanes.  This would allow many children to be able to fly.  As of now, there are many children who cannot fly because of the potential of contacting peanuts/nuts.",,,,,,,

If someone wants to eat them, they can get them almost any place.

One example is that Delta sells a direct Fort Myers to Los Angeles flight that actually goes from Fort Myers to Minneapolis, where you have to change planes, and then Minneapolis to Los Angelses.  Not only is it deceptive, but Delta only gives frequent flyer miles on the distance between Fort Myers and Los Angeles even though the distance travelled is much greatere.  Also, it could be that if the first segment of Fort Myers to Minneapolis is delayed, you might miss the connecting Minneapolis to Los Angeles flight even though it has the same flight number and you bought it as a direct flight.

My proposal is to only allow direct flights if there is no change in aircraft or terminal AND that the intermediate city be fully disclosed when purchasing such a direct flight.  Alternatively, just disallow this misleading practice altogether.

I suffer from an anaphylactic peanut allergy. The newscast stated that most peanut allergies cause mild symptons. I think you should research that a little more, as I do not believe that is the case. Part of the reason they ban peanut butter in schools is that most sufferers have anaphylactic versions of this allergy and children do not understand the severity of it or the concept of sudden death. I do not think the number of cases has increased; I think we are just learning more and educating more about food allergies in general. The peanut allergy issue is not just about ingesting peanuts. There are MANY CROSS-CONTAMINATION ISSUES. Severe reactions can be triggered by the following: inhaling peanut dust, spit flying through the air and landing on your lips or in your eyes while someone is talking or chewing at close range to your face, people not washing their hands after eating peanuts(especially children) and then touching surfaces that others could touch such as armrests and toilet facilities, flight attendants snacking on peanuts and then touching beverage cups, other food or other items, without washing their hands first and so forth. Peanut proteins are known to remain in saliva (though we don't know for how long) so how do we know how long they remain on contaminated surfaces? Also, if I just smell a peanut, I immediately get dry heaves & itchy eyes. An airplane is a cramped air space where people are in close contact with each other, and many of them are unaware of the dangers lurking for passengers with peanut allergies.

There is no good reason to serve peanuts on an airplane when it can have life ending results. Peanut allergies are one of the deadliest - another snack can be served instead.",,,,,,,

She spent two days of a 4 day trip in our hotel room taking antihistamines and other medication such as prednisone. We were lucky that we did not have to have her admitted to the hospital but because we have dealt with this problem since she was two we were well versed in what to do to conteract these allergy problems and her anophelitic reaction. Unfortunately it is  difficult to prevent passengers from bringing on their own food and with more airlines charging for food it is more of a problem to restrict what people eat.

The fact that the airlines are not accomodating, despite the fact that theses individuals are covered by the ADA Act is dumbfounding.  Even if it weren't the law, it would just be the humane thing to do.

It is a simple fix when someone notifies the airlines they have a nut or peanut allergies ahead of time and to not serve them onboard the aircraft.  A simple announcement prior to the plane departing in the waiting area and onboard identifying that this is a peanut free flight is a very simple solution.  The dust from a bag of peanuts can go 20 feet in the air, this is recirculated and passed throughout the cabin.  When the dust is inhaled the individual can go into anaphylactic shock within a few minutes.  My son is just one of those individuals.  We rarely travel on public transportation anymore due to the peanuts served on the plane.  There are so many other things that can be served onboard an aircraft, seems logical to make this change.  I know that any airline willing to help give us a safe and secure flight is the one I will be flying.  With 12 million individuals with allergies, I think this might increase transportation.  Our son has had to have his epi-pen 9 times, most of those were from other people eating peanuts near him.  Never ingesting them.  This is a very real and serious allergy.

As the aunt of 2 nephews with severe reactions to peanuts, I know the importance of keeping this allergen away from them.  Though the idea of establishing separate sections for those with the allergy is nice, this is not an effective way to deal with the problem.  Peanuts are airborne and can travel from one section to another. Though some scientists disagree, would you take that chance for your child?  I wouldn't and neither would my sister.  Establishing peanut-free flights with advance notice will also not work.  The allergen sticks to materials and fabric.  I flew this weekend and sat next to a man with trrail mix that had all kinds of nuts in it.  He ate, licked his fingers and touchd all the surfaces around him.  Cleaning effectively would be costly and time consuming.  Not efficient for an airlines. The only effective method is to remove the allergen completely.  My newphews' father travels all over the world and would love to take his sons with him.  My oldest nephew flew so often he had frequent flyer miles until diagnosed at age 2.  By eliminating this allergen from all flights, a whole new world would open up for people like my nephews, thereby increasing business.  The slight inconvenience for one passenger to not have peanuts on a flight pales in comparison for another passenger to not arrive safely to his/her destination.  There are many other snacks available.  Think safety over convenience.  Passengers who like nuts can adjust.  My nephews deserve to know what it's like to fly.  They deserve to experience the entire worls; not just the places they can drive to.  Please regulate the airlines and ban peanuts/peanut products from all flights.  My nephews and I thank you!!",,,,,,,

Though my RAST allergy testing results have only shown a low-level allergy to peanuts, I experience an anaphylactic reaction in the presence of peanuts and tree nuts.  I typically need to have a distance of 1-2 rooms between a peanut source and myself; this includes food items containing peanut ingredients (e.g., granola bars, trail mix). As a result, I have been unable to travel by air for many years, which presents a great hardship to me. I have had to forego many trips I wished to take as a result, and have had to settle for an occupation that does not require air travel, since flying to conferences or other research institutions would be impossible for me with the current allowance of peanut products on airlines. If the DOT were to enact new regulations banning peanut products on airlines, or at least providing a separate breathing area for peanut allergy sufferers, I would be able to use this method of transportation. As per the current guidance (i.e., Aug. 1998 DOT Aviation Enforcement Office industry letter), airlines are only encouraged to accomodate peanut allergy sufferers that provide medical documentation for a severe allergy to peanuts. This makes no allowance for individuals like myself who experience a severe allergy to peanuts, but said allergy is not strongly exhibited through RAST or skin allergy testing, therefore making it impossible to provide medical documentation of the severe allergic response. Changes to the current practice of allowing peanut products on airlines would make a significant difference in my life, as well as for the millions of peanut allergy sufferers in the U.S.",,,,,,,

I think there will be much less discrimination and harassment with a set policy in place.

I think just education for the airlines would be tremendous.  I think that if any pilot or flight attendant had any idea of what a peanut could do, they would not what any person sitting next to a peanut or any food allergy that could put them at risk...it is the scariest thing I have ever seen in my life.

This includes nuts served by the airlines or carried on by passengers. Almost all nuts contain peanuts or peanut residue because of the way that nuts are processed. 
My son has a severe anaphylactic allergy to contact, ingestion and possibly breathing peanuts or peanut products. His last anaphylactic reaction was from a small amount of peanut butter on his hand.
Because of the great risk of him contacting peanut residue on airline seats or food trays or breathing peanut and nut residue in the air of the recirculated ventilation system on airlines, it is not possible for him to fly. My husband and I live 2000 miles from both sets of grandparents and a large extended family. 
The fact that our son cannot visit his relatives if very distressing and lonely for our family.
Some considerations:
One injection of Epinephrine lasts only 15-20 minutes. Epinephrine can cause serious reactions in the body that need to be treated by IV fluids and drugs at a hospital.
If the allergic reaction causes a broncospasm, Epinephrine will not treat this reaction and the victim will die. 
Peanut allergy reactions can be biphasic and return after an injection of epinephrine, especially if the victim continues to be exposed to the allergen. 
As distressing as not being able to fly is for my son at this time is, not being able to fly will affect his life in the future. He will not be able to have a job where travel is involved, or belong to a sports team that travels or serve in the military.

August 8, 2010

	Founded in 1953, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) is a national foundation dedicated to serving the more than 60 million Americans with asthma and allergic diseases.  AAFA provides free information to the public, offers educational programs to consumers and health professionals, leads efforts to improve patient care and supports research to find better treatments and cures.  AAFA conducts outreach to patients in the form of online surveys, advocacy training and focus groups.
Summary
	Anaphylaxis is a serious medical complication, which can be life-threatening if rapidly developing symptoms are not treated promptly.  On planes, this risk is heightened due to limited medical care and resources.  Curtailing distribution and consumption of peanut products will decrease a peanut allergic passenger’s sense of risk when flying.  Providing clear notice of airline policies, effective emergency treatments and training for airline personnel to support policies and treatments is reasonable.  So is having epinephrine auto-injector availability on all commercial flights.  The Department should require that airlines offer the peanut-allergic flying public no less.
AAFA urges the Department of Transportation to:
1.	Require airlines to implement consistent, uniform policies and practices that provide better access to air travel for people who have severe peanut allergies;
2.	Require airlines to provide mandatory training to airline personnel on policies and practices that promote the safety and comfort of peanut allergic travelers;
3.	Require airlines to include epinephrine auto-injectors in the emergency medical kit on every passenger flight;
4.	Ban airlines from serving peanuts and products containing peanuts; and 
5.	Require that airlines offer peanut allergic patients a peanut-free zone or peanut free flights upon request.
Discussion
In recent decades, the medical community has documented a rise in atopic conditions, specifically affecting young children.  Reported food allergy prevalence among those younger than 18 years of age has increased 18% from 1997 to 2007.   This overall trend reflects the growth of peanut allergies in the United States.  During the five years between 1997 and 2002, the prevalence of peanut allergies in children nearly doubled.   The most severe symptom associated with peanut allergy is anaphylaxis, a rapid onset, immunologic reaction that can be fatal.  In order to avoid serious complications, allergic individuals often carry self-injectable epinephrine in the event of an episode.  
	To an extent, most airlines recognize the risks that confront allergic individuals who travel by air, but airline policies and practices vary.  Some request information about allergies at the time of ticketing, and some suggest letting gate personnel know of any allergy requests.  Some will announce that there is an allergic passenger on board.  Some airlines continue to serve peanuts.  Some will stop doing so at the request of a passenger, and others will request that other passengers refrain from opening packages containing nuts.  Another leaves the decision to curtail peanut distribution to the crew.  At least one says it will assist in assuring cooperation from other passengers; however, another states it will not make such announcements or request restraint by other passengers.  Even where airlines have policies, their personnel may apply them inconsistently, or they may not make them available in advance of travel.  Allergic consumers report that at least one airline aspires to “forward looking” policies but another posted a recommendation that travelers assess the extent of their allergies to determine if air travel is appropriate.  It should come as no surprise that many peanut allergic families face increased anxiety of suffering anaphylaxis thousands of feet in air, or avoid air travel altogether.
	Over the years, allergic travelers have complained to AAFA about airline policies and practices that are inconsistent, unevenly applied, not available in advance of travel or expose them to allergy triggers.  In a recent case, the mother of a nine year old with severe peanut allergies expressed concern that her son might have a significant allergic reaction while traveling onboard a domestic flight.  Various gate and crew personnel from the air carrier gave mixed messages to her, first allowing her to board early to wipe down the assigned and nearby seats, then removing her and her son from the flight, and ultimately allowing them back after ascertaining that she was carrying two EpiPens® and Benadryl®.  
	Granted, no airline can guarantee that passengers with severe allergies will have an absolutely safe flying experience, completely free of exposure to peanuts or other triggers.  Airline passengers do not expect guarantees but peanut allergic passengers would benefit from consistent airlines policies and practices that they can ascertain well in advance of their flights so that they can make appropriate choices.  
	Therefore, AAFA welcomed the June 2010 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) requiring airlines to make policies protecting passengers with severe peanut allergies in accordance with the Air Carrier Access Act disability provisions.  DOT invited the public to comment on the following options:
•	Banning the serving of peanuts and all peanut products on all flights covered by DOT's disability rule	
•	Banning the serving of peanuts and all peanut products on all such flights where a passenger has requested a peanut-free flight in advance
•	Requiring a peanut-free buffer zone if a passenger has requested a peanut-free flight in advance 
DOT also solicited comments on whether epinephrine auto-injectors would sufficiently protect individuals with severe peanut allergies, and whether the individual or the airline should be responsible for providing the device.
	Shortly after the Department released the NPRM, the Secretary of Transportation noted that the Department would uphold the terms of a 2000 Appropriations Act, which limited a 1998 attempt to increase protections for air travelers with peanut allergies.  The Act forces the DOT to wait 90 days after a peer-reviewed scientific study that determines there are severe reactions by passengers is submitted to both Congress and the Secretary of Transportation before it can regulate peanut distribution on airlines.  
	Notwithstanding this development, AAFA is commenting on the proposed rule because of its importance to the allergy and asthma community, and because certain aspects of the proposed rule relating to peanut allergic airline passengers' interests are unrelated to peanut distribution on commercial airlines.  The next section presents four areas of recommendation.
1.  	Allergic Airline Passengers Deserve Clear, Consistent Policies and Practices.  
	Allergic passengers face extraordinary challenges in flying on commercial carriers.  Once the Department is able to fully regulate peanut distribution on airlines, AAFA urges it to adopt rules requiring airlines to implement consistent, uniform policies and practices that provide better access to air travel for people who have severe peanut allergies.  Those policies should require the airlines to adopt rules mandating that airlines post their allergy policies, implement a clear and accessible process for passengers to request a reasonable accommodation for their peanut allergy, and offer a means for immediately reporting and redressing complaints to airline personnel.  
	The benefit to passengers will be significant because they will have access to information about airline policies in advance and those policies will be consistent across air carriers.  Consistent policies and practices will not guarantee safety, but may encourage passengers who now avoid flying due to health concerns and uncertainty about whether and how their chosen air carrier will accommodate their peanut allergy or refuse them service.  
	In addition, airline personnel should be familiar with such policies and practices so that passengers will not be endangered, inconvenienced or humiliated by ignorance and misinformation about the nature of severe allergies and practices that lower the risk of anaphylaxis.  Therefore, AAFA urges the Department to adopt rules requiring airlines to provide mandatory training to airline personnel on policies and practices that promote the safety and comfort of peanut allergic travelers.
2. 	Protect passenger safety by requiring airlines to carry epinephrine auto-injectors on every passenger flight.  
	Currently, the 2000 Federal Aviation Regulation requires two 1:1000 and 1:10,000 dosages of epinephrine on all passenger-carrying planes as part of an enhanced emergency medical kit (EEMK).   Epinephrine has been in emergency medical kits since 1986, but no regulation requires auto-injectable epinephrine.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) declined to require them, stating that studies did not reveal a need to make epinephrine auto-injectors available and suggested a greater need for oral treatments to allergic reactions.   
	As allergic patients await improved breakthrough oral treatments, auto-injectable epinephrine is available now and offers substantial benefits for use on airlines since the handy, premeasured device reduces administration time and improves dosing accuracy.  Both are crucial when treating anaphylaxis.  The Department has the opportunity to improve the flying conditions for all travelers with allergic reactions by requiring epinephrine auto-injectors on all flights.  Therefore, AAFA urges the Department to require airlines to include epinephrine auto-injectors in the EEMK on every passenger flight.  Further, the Department should require airlines to train flight crews to properly administer the medication.  
3. 	Promote accessibility by prohibiting airlines from serving peanuts.
	AAFA urges the Department to ban airlines from serving peanuts and products containing peanuts as soon as the Department determines that it is permitted to make such regulations.  AAFA recognizes that distributing peanuts and snacks that contain peanuts on airlines has become culturally iconic.  Yet safety considerations have forced the flying public to adopt behaviors unfathomable before 9/11, like surrendering one’s coat, jacket and shoes for a search, limiting liquids in carry-on luggage, even submitting to a revealing three-dimensional whole body scan.  Passengers subject themselves to these intrusive measures for safety’s sake.  AAFA asks that the Department expect the flying public to cooperate by giving up its expectation of onboard peanuts, in favor of other salty snacks, to promote the safety of severely allergic passengers.  
4.  	Promote accessibility by offering peanut allergic patients a peanut-free zone or peanut free flights upon request.  
	In 1998, DOT required airlines to make a reasonable accommodation to air travelers who are allergic to peanuts (pursuant to the disability provisions of the Air Carrier Access Act [ACAA]).  The agency suggested that airlines, if given advance notice, provide a peanut-free buffer zone in the immediate area of a passenger with a medically-documented severe peanut allergy.  Then, Congress intervened and directed DOT to stop regulating peanut distribution or face a funding cutoff.  
	As the Department’s previous regulatory proposal indicates, limiting the distribution and consumption of peanut products on covered flights is a reasonable approach to making airlines safer for severely peanut allergic passengers.  This alternative is distinct from the ban on peanut distribution because it impacts choices made by other passengers to consume peanuts onboard.  AAFA understands that prohibiting possession and consumption by passengers may be impractical for airlines to enforce.  However, discontinuing serving peanuts by airlines may not be a complete strategy for enhancing peanut-allergic passenger safety.  Peanut dust and residue on seats and tray tables can trigger reactions in passengers who occupy nearby seats and rows.  For some, peanut residue and dust anywhere on the plane can be a life-threatening.  We are encouraged that passengers who are informed by courteous airline crewmembers about the need to accommodate a severely allergic traveler will comply with those requests.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2010-0140-1125/attachment_1.pdf",

We would like to comment with respect to the issue of peanuts on airplanes, as many Canadians whom we represent frequently travel on airlines that fall under the mandate of the Department of Transportation.

In Canada, the Canadian Transportation Agency recently made a decision to create a buffer zone at the back of aircraft that will be peanut-free, and make announcements within the cabin upon the request of an allergic passenger. This policy is not perfect, but provides an appropriate first step in an ongoing discussion.

It is our hope that the Department of Transportation could adopt strengthened standards, which would force Canadian carriers to strengthen their policies as well.

Specifically, we request:
- That airlines provided mandatory training for personnell on aircraft about the severity of nut and other allergies, sensitivity, and medication usage
- That airlines are required to carry epinepherine auto-injectors in the medical kits of each passenger flight
- That airlines are banned from serving products that contain peanuts on their flights
- Upon the request and prior registration of a passenger who self-identifies with a peanut allergy, a flight be designated 
""peanut free"" and other passengers on that flight be alerted (via e-mail). Upon such a request, any further passengers booking that flight will be informed prior to purchase
- A buffer zone of seats on the aircraft where peanut products will never be allowed, and staff enforce this
- Allowing a passengers who self-identify with allergies to sit in these seats without the additional cost of seat-reservation fees

Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

I am extremely allergic to nuts and cannot be in an area where nuts are present.  As a result I have not been able to fly on certain airlines despite them saying that they will have a buffer.  I was once on a 2 hour flight that did not serve nuts on that particular flight, but since the airline regularly served peanuts and there was nut debris on the plane, by the time the plane had landed, I had difficulty breathing and required medication.  That was the last time I flew that carrier.  This does not only impact me, the allergic individual, but also my family who also cannot have the freedom to choose which airline they fly if we are to fly as a family.  This has also resulted in my family having a higher cost to fly since we cannot always choose the lowest cost flight. We are able to mandate nut free areas in schools, I don't understand why we cannot do the same on airplanes.  It is stressfull enough to worry about having a reaction on the ground where you can obtain medical help in a reasonable amount of time, but you can imagine the stress of worring if something will happen in the air!  I really don't understand why airlines still serve nuts knowing all of the allergic people and their families- I can't imagine the cost of having to divert a plane for an ill person.  I feel to best protect everyone- the nut allergic person, as well as those passengers who would be inconvienced if a life threatening situation developed due to a reaction to nuts, DOT should require airlines ot stop serving nuts on all flights.",,,,,,,

I have traveled with her several times to India on planes that did not serve peanuts. Due to her severe allergic condition we have adopted peanut-free and tree nut-free food for our entire family.  However, when we were traveling by a flight operated by Air India in July 2006, she fell sick within half hour after a snack containing peanuts was distributed (just before landing in Frankfurt).  Neither this daughter nor any others in our family took these snacks. We had alerted the airline to my daughter’s condition when purchasing the tickets and also a couple of days before boarding the flight. The airline assured us that they would not distribute peanuts, but they did anyway. By the time we reached Chicago, she was in distress and was wheezing. When we came home, I took her to the doctor and after a lengthy conversation, the doctor agreed to test her for antibodies for peanuts and tree nuts. The diagnostic report then confirmed that she was exposed to both peanuts and cashews (IGE for cashews were 0.87KU/L (should have been < 0.35 KU/L) and peanuts were 2.35 KU/L (should have been < 0.35KU/L). Both peanuts and cashews were served in the plane. We stopped traveling with that airline after that episode. 

We live in Woodbury, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis-St. Paul. Until recently the major airline carrier for us was Northwest Airlines that had a peanut-free policy. They served pretzels instead of peanuts. We traveled on Northwest Airlines on three more trips to India without an issue. Now Northwest Airlines has merged with Delta and Delta has revoked the peanut-free policy on Northwest Airlines.

We traveled on Delta last December to New Jersey and Delta distributed Peanuts during the flight. We had alerted the flight to our daughter’s condition and Delta at the time of reserving the flight.

My friend is deathly allergic to peanuts and all tree nuts.  I plead to see all nuts banned from flights so that my family and I can fly safely. Many are severely allergic to peanuts and tree nuts, including airborne reactions.  Also, people allergic to peanuts are told by their allergists to avoid tree nuts too, in an effort to avoid sensitization and to increase the odds of outgrowing the allergy. It would be terrible to see peanuts banned but tree nuts provided as the substitute, since nuts are processed in shared facilities resulting in cross-contamination.  

I strongly prefer the option of banning the serving of peanuts and ALL peanut products in ingredients lists, on ALL flights.  It is impossible to adequately clean all surfaces from floor to ceiling in a plane of all traces of peanut protein, including the fabric on the seats.  It is too life-threatening to me and others in my situation to be in a plane covered in ""nut dust"".

I suggest that when an allergic passenger is on a flight, an announcement be made on board asking all passengers to please not open any products with nut ingredients during the flight due to a passenger on board with life-threatening nut allergies.

There have been a few scientific studies on allergic reactions on airlines, which are:

I am a former pilot for United Airlines and when my youngest daughter went in to anaphylaxis the first time at 1 year of age I had to resign to take care of her special needs.  Since then we have not been able to travel as the risk is too great.  If 100 plus passengers open a bag of peanuts on a flight the dust from those peanuts will circulate throughout the cabin and most likely cause her an anaphylactic reaction.  Although we carry her Epipens with us at all times, if this were to occur in flight we would need an emergency landing and an ambulance to meet us.  For this reason we just simply don't fly which is very difficult for our entire family as we have family all around the world we used to visit on a regular basis.  I would truly appreciate the DOT stepping in and making airline travel safe for everyone.  Peanut allergies are different from other food allergies in that they are airborne from the peanut dust.  Someone with a dairy, egg, soy, wheat etc. allergy does not need to worry about that in flight because they would have to ingest the allergen to have a reaction.  My daughter, 3 years old now, has multiple food allergies and has been in anaphylaxis twice and nearly died - all due to peanuts.  Our lives look very different from what I thought they would because of her limitations.  We would LOVE to be able to fly again and take the kids to Disney and visit auntie over in England.  I truly pray you will help us and the millions of peanut allergy suffers to be able to fly again.  Please remove all peanut products from the airlines.  Thank you.",,,,,,,

The risk of a reaction is higher if all passengers are handed packages of peanuts. 
The banning of all peanut products would be the safest.  Since most airlines are already doing this, you would only be justifying and supporting their decision and passengers would not need to worry about airlines changing their policies.
Banning peanuts on flights where a peanut free flight has been requested in advance would be the next best option.  My son has traveled with Sky West Delta and before he boarded the crew thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed the plane.  For a larger plane the wait time and airline costs would increase.  My son did not have any problems on the flight.
The option requiring a peanut free buffer zone is not an adequate option and we do not fly on Delta for this reason.  I have sent three emails to Delta and have not received an adequate response.  The most recent email was sent to Delta on 6/28/10 and I have received no answer.  I asked if they had any scientific research documents showing that their air filtration system filters out peanut particles that could prove that their ""buffer zone"" is safe.  Our doctors do not believe that the airlines air filtration adequately filters out peanut particles and have advised us to only fly on airlines that do not serve peanuts.  I sent this email to Delta prior to a group trip involving my daughter because the majority of her group wanted to fly on Delta since it was the only non-stop flight offered.  Since I did not receive a reply from Delta, my conclusion is that there has been no research and that the buffer zone is not safe.  University group travel presents a problem if the majority of the group want to fly on an airline that serves peanuts.  My daughter reserved a flight on a different airline.
If the DOT is required to monitor the airline safety you must regulate peanut distribution.",,,,,,,

The people sitting near who heard this exchange were kind enough to assure her they would not eat peanuts.  This example highlights the need for rules for the airlines. When making reservations on Southwest she was told that they would not serve peanuts on that plane the day she was travelling only to be told when she arrived for the flight that they can only guarantee that on the first flight of the day.

The rate of children with anaphylactic allergies to peanuts has doubled from 1997 to 2003 according to several studies.  The Food and Allergy Anaphylaxis Network estimates that there are over 15,000 emergency room visits and many deaths each year caused by anaphylactic allergies.

My child developed her first reaction at preschool when she was 2.5 years old and had eaten peanuts and peanut butter with no ill effects prior to then.

Please, please help us provide with a SAFE flight environment by banning the airlines from serving peanuts.  The life you save maybe someone you know.

Thank you,

He has also reacted to someone eating a peanut butter sandwich 3 rows away. Most fellow passengers have shown support & empathy; we have never had a fellow passenger complain. I would hope someone would fore-go peanuts for a few hours if they witness someone in anaphylactic shock.  
We take responsibility for our son's health, & take the following precautions:
*carry Epi-pens/Benadryl
*notify airline when making reservation
*notify gate agent on arrival
*notify flight attendants on boarding
*pre-board & wipe down seats/armrests/tray tables
*use wipes on bathroom door handles/overhead bin handles
*carry medical/insurance info in case of an emergency
*bring own snacks/food
We only fly Southwest whenever possible, as they gladly refrain from serving peanuts when notified. We were recently told peanuts costs SW much more than other snacks; since other snacks are available (pretzels, cheese nip crackers), it is not an imposition on them or other passengers.
Specific comments requested:
*we welcome a peanut ban since other snacks are readily available, easily substituted & serve the same primary purpose of providing a brief snack; it would also result in cost savings for the airlines. Since an allergy to peanuts in particular can be severe & deadly, this would help mitigate exposure.
* buffer zones for airline-provided service alone are not totally effective because the air is recirculated; realizing no one can control what passengers bring on, a buffer zone would be appreciated to mitigate exposure (i.e. a child in the seat behind us eating a peanut butter sandwich, then grabbing/touching our seatback)
*peanut-free flights are a compromise, with the added precautions that we take as noted above, & the buffer zone
*Epi-pens and Benadryl should be included in medical kits on every flight.

For children that have this disability it becomes impossible to enjoy a fully normal life because they cannot fully participate in many social and fun activities which the rest of us enjoy so much without a second thought. They can't go to ball games, they can't enjoy summer barbecue in the park, they can't participate in the summer neighborhood cookouts and the list goes on and on.

On top of this due to the uncaring attitude airlines have towards people with nut allergy these children and their families also become disconnected from their friends and relatives that are not within driving distance. This further isolates children from their families and friends because traveling long distance safely is not a practical option for them.

Treating people with disabilities like this is a crime.

Airlines need to be regulated so they are required to provide a nut free flight when they have been notified in advance that a person with nut allergy is traveling on any flight.

My daughter, Evelynn, is 2 1/2 years old.  She loves to play outside, loves to color on every sheet of paper in the house, is obsessed with Winnie the Pooh and the color purple, and she always has to put her shoes on herself.  She is the center of my world.  Evelynn is also allergic to peanuts and tree nuts.  Evelynn was 17 months old when I gave her a peanut butter brownie.  Moments after she finished that brownie I noticed that her face was bright red and splotchy.  The next day we went to the pediatrician to get Evelynn tested for a potential peanut allergy and a week later we were sitting in an allergists office where I was told that based on her testing Evelynn would die if she ever ate peanuts again.  

In this past year since Evelynn was diagnosed I have learned everything I possibly can about peanut allergies and how I can best protect my daughter.  Evelynn wears a medical bracelet with her allergy diagnosis.  At her young age Evelynn already knows to check the diaper bag for her epi pens before we leave the house and she is learning to ask if food is safe for her before she eats it.  It has been a year since Evelynn was diagnosed with her peanut allergy and we fortunately haven't had a reaction since.  If Evelynn is ever exposed to peanuts she will have an anaphylaxis reaction.  Evelynn would break out in hives and vomit and have diarrhea.  Evelynn would start to have problems breathing.  Evelynn's throat and mouth would swell, leaving her unable to breathe.  If Evelynn ever starts to show these symptoms I am suppose to hold her down and push one of her epi pens into her thigh which will give her a dose of Epinephrine and stop her reaction for a short time.  After that, I am to call 9-1-1 and Evelynn will go, by ambulance, to the nearest hospital for further treatment.

Evelynn wants to meet Mickey Mouse.  I would love the opportunity to take Evelynn to Disney World.  A nonstop flight from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Orlando, Flor",,,,,,,

Our family of 5 loves to travel.  Since one of our children has an airborn allergy to peanuts, we do not fly.  We drive.  Obviously this is limiting as we want to show our children the world.  

Doctors have advised us that we are unable to fly due to our son's airborn allergy to peanuts.  If someone were to open a bag of peanuts on a plane, it is extremely possible, and likely probable, that he would go into anaphalaxis shock.

There are so many families like ours that have been placed in this situation and if you all would seriously consider helping families like ours, it would be a blessing indeed.

Since our son will more than likely be allergic to peanuts for life, and we are not in a position to purchase a private jet, it is a true bummer that our summer vacations, spring break vacations, winter breaks, and mini-holidays are limited to places we can get to by car (within a reasonable amount of travelling time).

We live in Florida, which, thankfully, has Disney World.  Disney is OUTSTANDING when it comes to allergic children.  So a bunch of our time and money goes there... While Disney is fantastic, we would really love to show them the REAL world, not just Epcot.

Please consider changing your current rules and serve pretzels (like Rold Gold - that are not made in a peanut factory).  Anything you can do for our family, and others like ours, would be more than appreciated.

Thank you for your time and for allowing a family, like ours, to comment on such issues.

Sincerely,
The McCabe Family",,,,,,,

My daughter does not choose to have this allergy, nor is there any cure.  Simply ""avoiding"" the food is not enough, and to be in close proximity can be dangerous.  And she is certainly not alone; there are approximately 3.3 million American citizens with nut allergies.
 We ban smoking, underage alcohol consumption, and take many other initiatives for the health and wellbeing of our citizens. If a passenger with a severe nut allergy is exposed inflight, there are not adequate medical facilities to treat and potentially save the life of that passenger.  Many of us choose to not fly for this very reason, which considering the volume of patients with allergies, equates to significant financial loss to the airlines (in my family of 5, one has an allergy; but none of us can fly in order to keep her safe).  Many think that as long as we carry our EpiPens, that a nut reaction will be easily ""fixed"".  That is often not the case.  In fact there is something called ""rebound allergic response"" in which a secondary, but more severe, reaction can occur.  The only treatment is to get to an Emergency Department for breathing treatments.  This cannot be done in the confines of an airplane unless we equip them with medical treatment facilities, physicians, and respiratory therapits.  A much simpler solution is to ban peanuts.  Please, for the health and wellbeing of our citizens, consider banning peanuts from US aircraft.",,,,,,,

The biggest problem we have is what to do in the case that we notified the airline in advance of the allergy, and had them ensure us that an acceptable policy would be in place for our flight only to have them no honor that agreement when we get to the airport.

While an allergic person should carry an epi-pack, this only buys you enough time get to an emergency room if you are on the ground, not in the middle of a flight.  I have a son with a moderate peanut allergy and I hope that he never experiences such a life-threatening reaction.  I know several other children who have more severe peanut allergies.  Studies show that for whatever reason, peanut allergies are on the rise in the U.S. and it would be prudent for the airlines to accept this reality and take the necessary precaution of eliminating peanuts on all flights.",,,,,,,

He is severly allergic to all nuts.  He has had one life threating reaction due to ingestion and several serious reactions do to exposure.  My in-laws live in Fl. and we have chosen not to fly because it was very difficult the time we did.  The so called buffer zone doesn't work.  If someone eats nuts then touchs the knob to the bathroom, then my son touches it, he will have a reaction.  So whether that person is near him or not it can affect him.  In reference to making that flight he is on nut free as opposed to banning them.  I had a VERY difficult time reaching anyone ahead of time, and when I arrived at the airport I was told to talk to the stewardess who wasn't very happy about it.  I don't understand why this is even an issue.  Pretzels are an easy solution if a snack must be served.  That is something we can say we are not sure if it was process in a plant with nuts, so he won't eat it and that is the end.  I'm not constantly checking around me, wiping everything down, or watching his breathing or seeing if he has hives.  People make a big deal about not being able to eat nuts for a few hours, when I have to worry 24/7 (especially in a plane that is inclosed and no medical facilities) whether or not my son could die from the ingestion or exposure to a nut.  We are planning a trip to Disney World next year and I'm already stressing the plane ride to the point where I'm still considering driving.  But is that fair?  You can't ask someone to forgo nuts for a few hours because they might be upset, but you can tell me oh well either risk your son's life or drive.  Please take this into serious consideration.

serving peanuts to passengers, as far as I know they do not
offer peanut free flights to people with severe allergies.  The
only solution would be to eliminate them in the first place.
In the hopes that my words are heard by those that need
to hear them.

My comment is in regards to passengers affected by peanut allergies. As someone with a severe peanut allergy, I would not risk air travel. Having had past reactions to airborne peanut particles, I know better than to sit in an enclosed space with recirculated air. There's no way out when you are at 30,000 feet! Even with a dose of epinephrine in the event of a reaction, it simply buys you 15 minutes' time to get to a hospital and is not a remedy for an emergency on board aircraft. 

My suggestion, if you wish to prioritize the safety of your passengers with peanut allergies: Substitute peanuts with a peanut-free snack. There are many peanut-free options out there, such as pretzels, crackers, chips, fruit cups, sometimes even cookies and candies, depending on what type they are and how they are manufactured. (Always read labels and verify with the manufacturer that a product is free of peanut traces.) I am sure you'd have some customers complain about not getting peanuts for a snack, but if you wish to ensure passenger safety, a little education on anaphylactic reactions goes a long way. A customer can survive without a peanut snack for a couple of hours. And besides, who wants the inconvenience of a delayed flight which had to make an emergency landing to rush a passenger with a life-threatening reaction to the nearest hospital?

I believe a peanut-free flight is do-able and would be in the interest of all passengers on board. There are many people and organizations who can help with this task (for example, FAAN, the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, has been helpful in my experience). I hope these comments are constructive to the DOT, and if there is anything more I could help with please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks for your time!
Sincerely,
Stephanie Fowler",,,,,,,

If he touches any kind of nut including peanuts he would have a life-threatening reaction. If he ingests one thousandth of a nut or peanut, he would go into anaphylactic shock.  It doesn’t matter if they are on the ground or in the air. My friend would have to administer  the Epi-pens and get medical attention immediately (within 20 minutes).  If they are in the air, the plane would have to make an emergency landing.  I don’t know how fast a costly emergency landing could be accomplished, and this would greatly inconvenience all the passengers.  However, my friend's child could die if he did not receive medical attention. 
When my friend's family flies they have to bring 4 Epi-Pens on board, and their own food.  They have to notify the airlines ahead of time and make follow-up calls before the flight.  They board ahead of other passengers, wipe down the surfaces with Clorox wipes, check the seats, pockets, and the surrounding areas for dangers.    This is a lot of work and stress for them to fly and many people would chose not to fly.

It makes sense to keep all passengers safe by not serving peanuts or products with nuts in them.  The statistics show an increase in these allergies within the last 10 years.  This problem is getting worse.  Luckily, there are other safe snack options.  Serving these snacks instead would lessen the dangers of flying with our child, and it would help to avoid a costly emergency landing if he were to come in contact with peanuts or nuts.  Lastly, most people prefer to eat the pretzels anyway.",,,,,,,

Reactions to peanut allergies can be quite severe and in some cases  fatal. Because of the grave consequences, this is not a matter that should be taken lightly. I think if more and more airlines took preventitive measures to make flights, peanut-free, they would not only calm the worries of many parents of children with peanut allergies, but they also would be watching out for themselves should someone have an allergy attack while on their flight. Imagine the negative publicity or perhaps even lawsuit that they could avoid simply by taking this one simple step. There are so many varieties of snacks in this day and age of consumerism that peanuts or any other nut-related snacks can easily be substitued with other ""satisfying"" snack choices.

Banning peanuts and nut products from flights is the course of recommended action.  In a world where flying is as common as driving, this mode of transportation should be open to all individuals on domestic flights.  I have a six year old daughter who I deem it unsafe for her to fly with our current system.  This means that she and my family of four will not be purchasing airplane tickets.  Because peanuts and nuts are allowed on planes, we have not travelled to Texas, California, Florida, New York, and Maryland by air--this is all in the last year--even though we had events to attend.  The risk to her is too great.

Those flying can WAIT to have their peanut and nut products.  Would you allow someone to bring a weapon on a flight?  Of course you would not, but by allowing peanuts and nuts on flights where allergic individuals are present, you are doing just that.  The general public does not understand the severity of this peanut and nut allergy.  If they were to see a child  or adult undergoing an allergic reaction, and in need of an epi pen and immediate medical attention, then they would understand.  

While carrying an epi pen on flight is an obvious for those allergic to peanuts and nuts, a dose from an epi pen will last only 10 to 20 minutes before another is needed or more immediate action needs to be taken.  Why take this chance with someone's life?  Why not just ban peanuts and nuts?  They can still be sold in kiosks and consumed off the plane, but why would we allow individuals with a disability to be in such danger while flying in the air?

There are so many products that do not contain nuts and peanuts that can be served on flights.  Why not serve those?  

Please do the right thing and ban peanut and nut products from flights.  By doing the right thing, there will be a trickle down effect to manufacturers of many snack products who will be happy to provide peanut and nut free items.

It also is one of the most likelly to cause severe, or llifethreatening reactions without any ingestion.  I knkow one of the options is the peanut free buffer area for the allergic person.  We were on a flight like that, well, kids started throwing peanuts, so they ended up in the peanut free zone.  Also what if there is turbulence, and the snacks get thrown out of their area.  What if the restroom is not in the peanut free zone.  What about the other passenger that is eating peanuts, and has oil on their hands, and walks down the isle to the restroom and touches everything.  what about the air that is circulated through the cabin.  So a buffer free zone while it can work on the ground possibly , reallly isnt an option in the air, where the allergic person can not escape.  I do feel it is the allergic persons responsibility to carry their own meds, yet an epipen should probably standard on a airline emergency kit.  I also know that many people think, just take your medicine and quit whining.  The problem is some peanut allergy patients dont even need to eat the food.  Then if they have a reaction they can use the epipen, but that is not definitive treatment.  An epipen is only a treatment to use to get to an emergency room for further treatment and monitoring.  Many people need to carry 2 epipens.  So can you guarantee that if a reaction happens, that you can get a plane landed and get the patient to an emergency room in 15-30 minutes.  Very doubtful.  thank you, if you need any more input please contact m",,,,,,,

The food allergic community is extremely positive about the proposal to eliminate peanut service from airlines, and hopes that tree nut service will be eliminated at the same time.  

I started a petition in support of banning peanuts from airlines, which currently has 1,625 signatures from people world wide.  Approximately 100 people sign the petition per day.  You can read the petition and see the most up to date number of signatures by clicking here:

I understand that the original proposal to ban the distribution of peanuts on airplanes has been stalled due to the 2000 appropriations act, but as the parent of a four-year-old child who is extremely allergic to peanuts, I appreciate the DOT's willingness to receive comments on the original proposal. I wholeheartedly support the banning of peanuts on airplanes, and applaud the DOT's forward-thinking in regards to such matters. 
My son has aunts, uncles and cousins in England and France who we are unable to visit, because the chance of him having an anaphylactic reaction while 30,000 feet in the air is too great for us to risk taking a flight. I truly hope you continue your original efforts and support research that would allow Congress to approve a ban on peanuts during flights. Thank you for considering these comments. I write them as a concerned mother and have not been influenced by any special interest group or grassroots request.

I am a parent of a child with severe nut allergies.  We live in Detroit MI and several years ago Delta took over Norwest Airlines who didn't not serve peanuts on its flights.

As a parent of a child with a anaphalaxic reaction to all types of nuts, it is extremely scary to get onto an enclosed space where nuts are either being served or have previously been served.  Although I try to take every precaution by bringing our own snacks and wiping down his entire area (tray, handrests, seats, etc.), the fact that the majority of time the previous person seated in this seat had nuts in scary and mind boggling.  We did have an instance where, despite all of the precautions taken, my son had a topical reaction after using an airline blanket.  He broke out in hives and required Benadryl immediately.  This situation could have been much worse but seems unnecessary. There are so many other snacks that can be served that do not put a person's life in jeopardy.  People with nut allergies usually have epi-pens and histamine blockers with them, but the epinephrine commonly lasts for only 20 minutes.  My biggest fear is that if he did have a reaction and we did all we could, the airplane would be unable to get him medical assistance in that short time frame.  

It is understandable that the world cannot be nut-free, however with nut allergies on the rise, it would be great if the airlines were sensitive to the fact that this snack can actually kill people.  Serving it so regularly and in an enclosed space is truly the recipe for disaster.  

Thank you for your consideration of this information.

1. I have no problem with flights opting to serve pretzels in place of peanuts by request.
2. There is no feasible way to ban a modicum of peanut dust from entering the airplane, even if I don't have it on the plane, chances are great that I have consumed peanut butter immediately prior to boarding my plane. As a vegetarian, it is a stable source of a filling meal before long flights given that most domestic flights do not serve meals. I'm not going to risk my own well being by not eating. 
3. I'm sorry that your children are incredibly sensitive to peanuts; however, you need to realize that there is no way to avoid exposure in the real world. I know that if I'm around certain allergens then I'll have to take my inhaler; however, I don't expect the airlines to do things such as ban people from getting on a plane wearing specific perfumes or having the scent of cigarette smoke on them. Some people are incredibly allergic to pet dander, do you expect everyone to avoid animals before flying? No.
4. The purpose of the government isn't to infringe on the rights of the people. It also is not to confront every fear of the people. 
5. Consider children with severe immune deficiencies, do you expect the government to provide them with a totally germ free plane to travel in? I doubt it.",,,,,,,

I have a son with peanut and treenut allergies.  We have been dealing with this successfully for 8 years, keeping him healthy and safe. His only reaction to nuts/peanuts was during and after riding on an plane. I informed the airline of my son's allergies while making the reservation, when arriving at the airport, and once boarding the plane.  I was assured that no nuts/peanuts would be served that day.

Once the snack was served, my son's breathing became labored and I thought I could smell nuts. I asked the attendant to see a package of the snacks.  As it turned out, the snack was a trailmix that contained cashews.  We were fortunate that our flight was nearing its end and I was able to control the reaction with his inhaler and benadryl.  However, his breathing remained labored for four days after the flight.  

This experience kept us from flying with my son for five years for fear of a repeat. However, this year a flight was unavoidable.  I contacted the airline with the most direct, non-stop, and cheapest flight available, to inform them of my son's allergy.  I was told to refer to statements on the internet about allergies.  These statements basically said that the company was aware that people may be allergic to nuts/peanuts and therefore the company's policy was to let consumers know that they WILL be serving nuts on the planes.  I was shocked at the lack of understanding.  In the end we booked a flight on another airline which was not direct, had a layover, and cost 30% more PER PERSON!!!  I wrote a comment to the first airline to let them know that it seemed in their interest to reexamine their policy since there probably aren't too many people who would pay more and add a layover to their flight just so that they could eat a package of peanuts.

How is it possible that we have such little regard for people's safety and LIVES that serving peanuts takes precedence? I ask for your help with this.",,,,,,,

I am quite surprised they haven’t banned them by now.

It’s obliviously something environmental and its quite frustrating ecperts  don't know exactly what is causing these deadly allergies. Even doctors can not predict the type of reaction that can occur in people with mild to sever allergies.

Peanuts are the most deadly food allergy out there. I have a child with a peanut allergy and I would be a nervous wreck if I had to take a flight where peanuts were served. 
There are meant things to consider:
People who are not familiar with allergies are not aware how serious an allergy can be or how easy cross contamination is. Hence, they will not think it’s important to wash their hand as thoroughly after consuming peanuts, etc. They just don't care.
If an allergic reaction occurs, and an epi pen administered the plane would have to make an emergency landing due to a medical emergency, which would cost money and also upsetting a lot of passengers.
If someone ate peanuts and touched the seat, arm rest, bathroom door etc, a person with an allergy could have a reaction if they came in contact with those surfaces where peanut dust was. If they touched the seat and then ate a snack, the peanut dust could be ingested and cause a reaction. And kids touch everything!

Recycled air is another major concern. Peanut dust can circlulate in the airplane. If I have been told by many doctors to be careful at baseball games, then a small plane with recycled air should be a major concern. The dust can fall on food, can be inhaled, etc. 
It really too much to risk to server peanuts as snacks on airplanes, it’s not worth it, and people who need their nuts can have it after the flight. Unfortunately there is a rise of this allergy and it can be deadly.",,,,,,,

When we do board an aircraft, we use baby wipes to clean our entire row of seats, seat belts, tray tables, and the seat back in front of us to remove peanut dust and residue. In spite of our best efforts to minimize allergen exposure to our daughter, flying is still a very stressful event. The few times we have flown, she invariably sneezes, scratches, and breaks out in hives; a far cry from anaphylaxis (which she has experienced, unfortunately), but still a real possibility that keeps us on edge throughout the entire flight.

We do carry EpiPens and Benadryl everywhere we go, but for those who think having medication on hand in case of an allergic reaction is analogous to having spare Pampers on hand to change to dirty diaper, you are incredibly out of touch with reality, uninformed on the issue, or both. For anyone to maintain that their hunger “satisfaction” from a 100-calorie bag of peanuts is more important than the safety and/or life of a human being is blatantly insensitive and ignorant.

Take peanuts off of planes. Safety first.",,,,,,,

The last statistics that I found revealed that 61% of all food related deaths occurred as a result of peanut exposure, followed by tree nuts (33%). Peanuts pose a similar risk to having a passenger with a loaded gun on a plane. If there were a gun on the aircraft, there would be no guarantee that someone would shoot, furthermore, if someone were shot, there is no guarantee they would die. The potential for death, however, is equally salient.  Another issue related to physical safety is the distance to a hospital during a flight. Individuals experiencing anaphylaxis must get to a hospital immediately. Placing individuals at risk for anaphylaxis can create a greater inconvenience to passengers than simply not eating peanuts for a few hours. I believe that providing safe zones on planes, or banning peanuts for only certain flights, is unrealistic. Individuals eating peanuts will likely move about the cabin and leave peanut residue on seats, on emergency placards, and in bathrooms. Peanut residue can remain on a surface for 6 months unless cleaned properly. Cleaning peanut product is extremely challenging. In fact, the cleaning products that would be necessary to remove peanut residue would ruin fabrics. The cleaning process would be time consuming, and probably not easily accomplished between flights. Airlines lose business due to peanut allergy suffers. Not only do many individuals with peanut allergies avoid flying because of the risks, but also their families. It seems like better health policy and business practice for airlines to remove peanuts from airplanes. If we can remove cigarettes from airplanes, we should remove peanuts. In America people have rights to do what they want UNLESS it puts another person at risk. Peanuts put over a million people at risk for death. I also understand that peanut farmers are concerned about this issue; I urge you, do not place profit over life. Thanks",,,,,,,

Even though no one wants them, they still exist.  Wishing doesn’t lessen their severity, rate of occurrence, or the impact that they have on millions of people everyday.  More people have food allergies than ever before.  It is time to rethink food allergies and their impact.  The DOT can help reduce the level of pain for all of us struggling with food allergies.  It can help raise awareness and understanding too.  While it would be nearly impossible on an airplane, to offer food that is safe for everyone, one small step can greatly reduce the stress for most folks dealing with serious food allergies.  No one has an urgent need for a particular food, at a particular meal, thus banning the two most common causes of food allergies on airplanes is a small but meaningful step.  By banning peanuts and tree nuts everyone still has choices of foods to eat and far fewer people have to risk their safety, even their lives, because of food.  
The blatant safety problem with the current system of restricting peanuts for three rows in front and behind a person with serious food allergies is that people drop food when they eat.  The nuts don’t stay within their allotted zone.  Also, airplanes are not cleaned often or well.  The same peanuts and tree nuts often make multiple flights before they are removed.  I was on a flight where no peanuts were served, but my two-year old son with severe food allergies, found a peanut and put it in his mouth.  He did have a reaction.
Will planes be grounded due to anaphylaxis?  It is inconvenient for all passengers on board not involved in the situation, life or death for those coping with it.  Compare the cost of a flight not making its destination and rerouting all passengers to permanently changing the menu.  Will hospital stay or funeral expenses be provided for the victims?  Use common sense and remove them from airlines.  Peanuts or tree nuts can be eaten in the airport before and after the flight.",,,,,,,

My allergist informed me that although it has previously been uncommon - - adult onset peanut allergies are popping up all over the nation.  At first I could tollerate being around peanuts, just not eating them myself.  Just before a planned vacation, I began to be allergic to airborne peanut dust.  I went on my flight as planned, informed the airline, flight attendants, etc.  They assured me they were not serving peanuts.  Well - - they served honey nut cheerios, and I had a sever reaction.  I took my medication, but it only helps if I get away from the allergen (peanuts).  I had to sit in the bathroom from California to Florida, because it was the only ""safe"" air for me to breathe.  On my return flight I was told that they could only provide a ""peanut-free zone"" which did me no good, because the air on flights is recirculated.  Luckily I had bought a mask on our vacation that filters out small particles.  I wore the mask and was okay - - this time.

I was in the hospital last month because I suffered what they call ""anaphylactic shock.""  I ate at a restraunt that did not cook my food seperately from the other food.  I started having a normal allergic reaction, and then I felt like someone was trying to strangle me.  I could not breathe.  I had to give myself 2 shots of epinephrine beofre I felt some relief.  I could have died.  Is it really that important for you to serve peanuts on your flights at the expense of many people's lives?  Aren't there plenty of other snacks to serve that wouldn't be life-threatening to your patrons?  You could argue that many people are allregic to wheat, and milk, or eggs - - so what would you have left to serve.

We had antibacterial wiped with us and proceeded to clean them. But in a word- YUCK!!! For an allergic person that could have become a disaster!!! No one ever wants to use an EPI pen. Especially in the air. EPI's do not last and unless you are planning on landing the plane in 10 mins or less forget that plan. AND, I've had 2 friends with allergic children book flights alert the airlines to the allergy only to get to the plane and have them have made no accommodations for these children. This happens on 2 different airlines. One airline proceeded to serve the peanuts around the allergic child!!! I find the practice of serving peanuts on planes to be rude and disrespectful to all of us who have food allergies. Not to mention downright dangerous. It's only a matter of time until someone is hurt or worse, dies. I believe that only when there is a problem and the airlines are sued will they finally change their policies. Its unfortunate that it will probably take such a tragedy to change. Maybe they'll hear all of us asking them to stop serving them NOW before it's to late.",,,,,,,

Are the airline executives only taking their private jets?  If so, they have not experienced the daily, indeed, the hourly, frustration that happens in airports and on airplanes.  I certainly agree that people need to be courteous when it comes to carry-on baggage, and to be more polite in general.  However, the decisions the airline industry make - baggage fees, fees to change flights, inadequate compensation for overbooked flights, and time passengers spend on the tarmac - put customers and airport workers in an impossible, frustrating, and dangerously maddening position.  If we do not have these kinds of government regulations, I do not trust that the airline executives will take these things into consideration.

Our family enjoys traveling very much, but have found ourselves limited because the risk of accidental exposure is overwhelming.

I am very diligent in following all the safety protocols.  I make a note on the reservation of his allergy, I speak with the person who is checking us in and I then speak with the head flight attendant to let them know of our allergies.  I ask to pre-board (sometimes this is granted, others it is not) so that I can wipe down every surface that my son may come in contact with.

Even after I do this, my stress level is so high that it is hard to relax at all.  

Often times we are viewed as neurotic passengers who are making special requests.  There are many people who still don't understand the severity of food allergies. 

I have seen my son have to fight for his life two times because of his allergies.  It is one of the most scary things a parent can witness.  The idea that this could happen during a flight can be paralyzing.  I'm trying to raise my son just like every other child who doesn't have this disadvantage.  I'm trying to set an example for him that he can lead a normal and healthy life.

Yes, passengers who enjoy eating nuts will have to do without them for a few hours when they fly.

But as things stand now, children with severe nut allergies risk death.

When you balance the harms, the answer is obvious.

Setting restrictions on the eating of any one particular food group or identifying those who are allergic as suffering from a  ""disability"" will set precedents that will be never ending. 
In the proposed rule, it states that ""An individual with a disability is any individual who  has a physical ...or mental impairment that, on a permanent or temporary basis, substantially limits one or more major life activities...""  Given this definition, what's to keep those who are obese and requiring 2 seats from claiming their condition is a disability?  How about people with claustrophobia, or those allergic to shell fish - how would you accommodate them?   I myself am chemically sensitive and get severe asthma if I'm too close to someone who uses strong aftershave, perfume, or even deoderant.  Shall I ask for a deoderant free zone on my flights?  
Further, as cited in some others' comments, establishing a peanut free buffer zone does little to help since airbone peanut dust is the culprit and all air on a plane is recirculated.  (The same would be true for perfume free zones.)   Would you have to prohibit people from carrying on peanuts, deoderant or perfume?  Think of TSA's screening nightmare.  Where would it end?
People who have restrictions in living their lives must come to terms that there are going to be things they can't do, or that at the very least, that they themselves must take steps to accommodate.  Carry facemasks and epi-pens.  Tell those you sit next to of your allergy and see if they'll accommodate you - either by not eathing the peanuts or by moving before eating them. 
If Congress passes this law, it won't be long before there is an unmanageably long list of restrictions which will make air travel impossible.",,,,,,,

1. airlines are for profit and will not self regulate to protect allergic passengers as allergic passengers do not provide enough revenue for them (i.e. most airlines don't care unless they are forced to)
2. With 2 children with severe peanut allergies, our current choices are very limited in chosing an airline and we can't make a decision on price so we typically have to pay much more. The fact that airlines don't accomodate limits our freedom of choice to a huge extent. 
3. Many times, airlines not only don't accomodate but act hostile towards passengers with severe allergies (had been instances where a passenger with children would be removed of flights)
4. Strong relations of airlines with peanut suppliers seem to overtake common sense goodwill.
5. It is interesting that many airlines offer all kinds of special meals (on long haul flights, international) but not peanut/nut free meals, even though there are at least as many peanut allergic passengers as let's say gluten sensitive... it seems that for some reason, accomodating a peanut allergy is a tabu? 
6. I know many families who DO NOT FLY because of severe allergies. They would like to fly, but because of the current attitude of most airlines, they can't. They have to drive (even if it's thousands of miles) just because airlines won't pull their peanuts off one flight... that's not right.

Any regulation would help, as allergies can be deadly. Ideally, we would like airlines to not serve peanut/nuts on specific flights if a passenger has a severe allergy and they notify the airline. There are a few airlines that got it but most of them need regulations.

The airlines hae for decades shown that they do not want their travelers to be well educated when making airline ticket purchases.

Q. What needs to be done?
A. Easy, reinstate to regulations made in the late 1970's!
Provide travel agencies with access to an unbiased computer reservation system that details all airline rules and fees. Force airlines to pay travel agencies a 7% commission on sales made on their behalf to consumers.
The ""Customer Commitment"" program that was put in place several years ago, would have been good for consumers, except the airlines and Congress agreed that the rules would not cover web or travel agency sales. That left the ""Customer Commitment"" program covering only 12% of all airline ticket purchases.

My input would be to ask that whatever program is worked out, it cover a far greater percentage of airline ticket purchases, otherwise this is all a complete waste of everyone's time and energy!
I'd be happy to help you understand more of what consumers and travel agencies actually need.

Until 4 years ago, American Airlines offered special meals on all first class flights.

This is not fair on those passengers that require a special meal, especially when a meal is factored into the cost of the service.

When food or snacks are for sale, most of the food ought to be kosher - there is such a selection of kosher food available today, there is no excuse to not sell food that does not have kosher supervision - in fact Jet Blue airlines has such a policy.

My daughter is 12 years old and was diagnosed with the peanut allergy at the age of 2. Her levels are too high to be recorded on blood tests, and with this comes many lifestyle changes. We have kept her at a small school where all staff the severity of her reactions, we are unable to by any products with peanuts or peanut oil in them, as she has a reaction from the smell, and the residue from items containing peanuts.

We have lived with the allergy and become accustomed to the changes we need to make to prevent her from going into anaphylactic shock, but one thing that has remained a hardship is visiting family. My daughters reactions occur so easily that we cannot have her in small enclosed spaces that peanuts have been in. Therefore, when traveling we drive or take the train. But as this is very time consuming we never travel too far. We cannot visit grandparents, aunts, uncles, or cousins that live across the country. She often asks if we think someday she will be able to fly, and we have to tell her not unless they stop serving peanuts, or ban them on planes.

As a parent, my heart naturally goes out to my child. She has several allergies which sometimes affect her health, but none are as life threatening as peanuts. If the airline industry is stating that they only purchase a small percentage of nuts from the peanut industry, it only seems to reason that the economic effect to the growers would be equally minimal. And although the percentage of people with the allergy is at 1% or  3 million people, I think the airline industry should consider the number of family members attached to the 1% figure. I am sure we are not the only family of 4 that is not flying due to the possibility. Until they are completely banned, my family will have to remain grounded.",,,,,,,

The last time I flew, I had a middle seat. Shortly into the flight, I was surrounded by passengers happily munching what is to me, a lethal substance - peanuts. The smell was nauseating and scary, and all I could do was blow the air vent directly onto my face and hope that I wouldn't have a reaction at 30,000 feet. Luckily, I did not.

Given the effort the government and others expend to protect passenger safety, I would think that banning substances that are potentially fatal to passengers would be a no-brainer. 

Treat peanuts and other potentially fatal allergens with the same vigor as faulty equipment. Would one allow a plane to fly if there was a two-percent chance that the landing gear would fail? Of course not. 

The answer is simple: ban peanuts on airplanes and save lives.

The quality of air travel has declined over the past several years as airlines realize that individual passengers have few options.  

I very much support these rules. My only concern is that they are not extensive enough.

It does not seem ""fair"" that the airline can bump me with little penalty to them, but cost to me.  They frequently use ""weather"" as a reason for their delays to avoid any responsibility for their schedules, and leaving passengers with little recourse.

I don't check bags, but on a recent trip to the west coast, I saw a woman who had been standing in line for over 20 minutes (the airline's fault for not adequately staffing their counter--I couldn't run my business that way),  When she got to the counter it was 29 minutes before the time of her flight and the airline refused to take her bag.  

This industry clearly does not have a customer service attitude (as evidenced by the rude and surly treatment of passengers by the flight attendants--again not their fault, they are being abused by their management), so regulation is the only way to protect the public from their abuse.

Although I am not a fan of government rules, the only way to protect passengers in this current climate is regulation.  Please follow up these rules with more substantial changes.",,,,,,,

I am a mother of 2 kids a 5yrs old and a 4yrs old.Both of my kids are allergic to peanut/nuts. Now that peanut/nut allergy is becoming common in kids, I think people needs to be aware that it is not just ingesting peanut that will cause an allergic reaction or Anaphylaxis. My daugther's peanut/nut allergy is very sever she is a Class 6, the highest class. What does it mean, she can not be around anybody that is eating peanut butter or any nuts. A simple saliva or particle of it that gets in contact with her she will have a severe reaction. And if I am traveling and the only means of transportation is flying then this will be a little bit of a challenge. Being in an airline with peanuts as a snack will cause issue for people that have peanut/nuts allergy. It takes only 15mins to administer the Epipen. if this is not administered on time then of course the sad news, which is death. A CPR will not be an option because of the passages are all swollen. I know we can not change the world but I think if we make people aware of this situations I think people will slowly understand. All we asked is for it not to be served and maybe put a sign that its a peanut free zone no peanuts allowed. My kids go to a peanut free school. More and more schools are aware of the situation and are no longer serving any peanuts/nut products in school.
thank you for your time",,,,,,,

If the above is not possible, airlines should not serve peanuts or peanut products on a specific flight if they have been notified in advance that a passenger has a peanut allergy.  Planes are not cleaned between most flights so this is a lesser solution.

If the above two situations are not possible, a third choice is to provide a buffer zone where no peanuts or peanut products are served when the airline has been notified of a passenger with a peanut allergy.  This means that different passengers in the same flight class may receive different food (which is more difficult for the airline and mistakes could more easily be made), and may potentially cause hard feelings among the passengers toward the person with the peanut allergy.

Fees: The problem with the fees started shortly after 9/11 when airlines started losing revenue due to decreased travel. So what! I can't take luggage on the plane without having it searched and emptied out of things I need for the trip. I have to have bags that I check searched and what not. The least airlines could do for me is allow me to check baggage without having to pay them for it. At least 2 bags per person. Anything over that I certainly see as a reasonable charge. Fees to eat or sleep are ludicrous!! We would bring our own pillows & blankets oniwth us if the gov't would allow us to. But NO we have to succumb to whatever the plane has and now we are going to be charged to use it? Everybody is out for a dollar.

I have traveled many times in the past and have a peanut allergy (through injestion) and my daughter has a life threatening peanut allergy (through injestion and touch). While Delta will offer a buffer zone for no peanuts, it's not 100% carried through. I have called into Delta at registration and told them of my allergy, even re-iterated my allergy at check in, then again re-iterated the allergy at the gate check in and have still been on flights where no attendant addressed my allergy and in addition, they did not allow a buffer of 3 rows ahead of me and 3 rows behind me. I have not allowed my daughter (8 years old) to fly for a tremendous fear of her having an allergic reaction while on the plane. With an allergy sensitive to touch, it becomes an issue of her brushing up against a seat that may have peanut proteins on it or going to the bathroom where there have been peanut proteins left on the door or the sink, or sitting in a seat where someone has just left the plane and had peanuts. Any peanut proteins that are left behind could cause a fatal allergy in my daughter if not treated immediately. Even though I carry an Epi Pen for both of us, I know from experience that one or two Epi injections sometimes doesn't reverse the allergic reaction and additional injections may be required. Immediate emergency help should be attained if there's an allergic reaction and as the rules stand now, the airlines are imposing a huge health risk to allergy sufferers by continuing to serve peanut products on flights. It also becomes important for fellow passengers to refrain from peanut products, which would require additional monitoring from the airline attendants. Maintainig a safe flight covers a large area and it should be made to include protecting individuals with peanut/tree nut allergies while on flights, which ultimately should mean a flight free from nuts.",,,,,,,

The person with a nut allergy needs only to avoid eating food or snacks provided by the airline to ensure they don't ingest nuts or nut products.  There is no justification to deprive other passengers the opportunity to eat nuts, if they so choose.  

I was on a Northwest flight a few years ago.  The flight crew made an announcement after passengers were boarded & seated that another passenger with an acute nut allergy was coming on board.  We were ordered to not consume any food or snacks containing nuts throughout the flight.  When I told the flight attendant I had brought my own nut snacks on board and didn't want to pay extra for airline-provided snacks, she told me that if I failed to comply with flight crew directives I would be removed from the flight and face possible consequences!  This was an outrageous response to an unproven hazard to a passenger's health!

At the same time, airlines allow passengers to carry on pets, including cats, usually at no additional fee.  My wife is deathly allergic to cat dander.  She doesn't have to be in contact with a cat, merely in the vicinity of one.  She has such a severe cat allergy that she will experience an acute asthma attack and experience life-threatening respiratory distress.  The last time I complained to a flight crew member about allowing a cat on board, I was told that my wife and I could leave that plane and try to get on a later flight.

The inconsistency of these two responses is appalling!  If a passenger with a nut allergy wants apecial accomodations, they get them.  But if a passenger with an animal allergy wants protection and relief by the airline, they're denied.",,,,,,,

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this measure.  I have a severe peanut allergy.  When traveling on a plane that serves peanuts, I have a reaction to the peanuts being served around me.  Thankfully most airlines ban peanuts so air travel has been much more pleasant in recent years.  Unfotunately I recently flew on Delta, which I learned the hard way is one of two domestic airliens still serving peanuts.  On this flight as peanuts were served around me, I developed a mild, but annoying reaction - eyes watering, stuffy and sneezing the whole flight.  I will never fly Delta again as long as they serve peanuts - I do not think a ban of a few rows is adequate given how air is circulated on a plane.  I think most intelligent peanut-allergic consumers will avoid Delta and Southwest, but certainly would not object to a ban and think a ban could protect consumers who inadvertantly fly Delta or Southwest without realizing they serve peanuts.  My belief is that eventually a peanut-allergy sufferer will have a severe reaction on a Delta or Southwest flight and sue the airline, which might convince them to be more concerned about their cutomers.  I would think the airlines would voluntarily remove peanuts to reduce this risk, but maybe government regulation is needed.

Thank you for your time.",,,,,,,

If someone is allergic to peanuts, then take the medication that is needed to stop a reaction before you fly or find another means of transportation.  Like MOST of the population, I like peanuts and I am not allergic.

Nuts create the most severe of allergic reactions and there is no reason airlines need to serve this particular snack food.  There are so many other snacks they could serve such as pretzels, chips, etc. that after all this time the fact that they are still serving almonds and peanuts and perhaps putting someone's life at risk is quite frankly offensive.

Although everyone around me turned on their fresh air vents and closed their cashew snack packages I was very faint, and just after walking off the plane I fainted -- but I could have died. Nut allergies are serious!!!  

I recommend:

1) Tree nuts and peanuts should not be served or sold on planes. (Does someone have to die and a law suit occur while they're ""studying"" this?!!)

2) If a passenger has nut allergies and brings this to the attention of the flight attendant, a nut free zone of 6 rows in front and in back of that person should be established, in which passengers should be REQUIRED to comply by not eating nut snacks they brought with them, and turning on their fresh air vents.  All passengers should be REQUESTED to refrain from eating nut snacks they brought with them. 

3) If a passenger is feeling faint due to anaphalactic shock from nut allergies (or other allergies) the oxygen masks should be lowered!!!  The inconvenience of putting them back up is nothing compared to saving the life of someone who cannot escape the situation.

4) Re. 3 above:  Invent a way to let one oxygen mask down at a time for acute allergic attacks, as well as other medical emergencies that may occur on a plane.

I strongly support removing peanuts from all flights. Creating a buffer zone of rows around a peanut allergy sufferer does nothing to protect them when touching common areas, such as restrooms. If someone eating peanuts then went to the restroom and opened the door, peanut residue is left on the door handle. A peanut allergy sufferer, upon touching the door next would pick up that residue and risks a reaction. 

I believe this is different than say going to a restaurant or mall and facing the same risk. When you are on the ground, emergency services and hospitals are close by to stop the reaction and save lives. There is no way to quickly land a plane and provide the same level of emergency services to someone having an allergic reaction on the plane. 

For this reason I strongly urge the DOT to take the issue out of the hands of airlines and create an industry-wide ban. The ability to eat peanuts is not a right and but protecting peanut allergy sufferers under the ADA is. Airlines should not be allowed to continue to violate the ADA.",,,,,,,

Serving dry roasted nuts in an enclosed airspace with limited if any fresh air intake is about the riskiest practice the airlines could allow in the presence of an individual with a life threatening peanut allergy (second only to hiding peanuts in their food). The air quality on airplanes is already marginal. Why serve something that is not only a known allergen to 1-2 percent of the population, but is at the top of the list of allergens that can lead to death?  It is time for the DOT to forcibly sever the business relationship between the airlines and the peanut industry once and for all.  There are plenty of other venues where peanuts can be served without sharing such a cramped and co-mingled airspace.  The idea of a three row buffer zone is completely ridiculous, and just as ineffective as it was for non-smokers back in the dark ages of the airlines.",,,,,,,

I have lived with my peanut allergy for over thirty years and despite advocating for myself even at a young age, flying has been a very trying experience.
I regularly fly Southwest for both business and pleasure travel, simply because they are the only airline I can readily afford.  I have had several close calls because of holes in Southwest's peanut allergy protocol.  On my most recent trip, I followed all protocol to report my allergy and the flight attendants had not been properly trained to recognize Southwest's own peanut dust allergy card.  Peanuts were served on the flight and when I notified the attendant of my allergy it was met with a ""Oh that's too bad"" attitude.  I took two Benadryls in flight and arrived home with severe asthma and in very poor health.
I would strongly encourage the DOT to impose a ban on peanut service in-flight.  Despite airline's attempts to continue to make flying safe for individuals with peanut allergies, there are training and performance gaps that continue to endanger individuals with severe peanut allergies.",,,,,,,

I have observed the lengths to which my wife goes to ensure she is able to fly safely.  She can recite the peanut allergy protocols for the major airlines backward and forward and adheres to them stringently.  Yet, she has had two major reactions in the past year due to airline employees being improperly trained or simply not caring or thinking that a peanut allergy can be that severe.
Severe allergies are so much more than a stuffy nose and mild discomfort - they are a life threatening situation.  We cannot expect all severe allergy sufferers to drive or find alternative transportation, when they have every right to the convenience of flying.

Peanut allergies in children have increased 3 fold in the past 10 years and is still on the rise.  This is a serious problem that can have fatal consequences and needs immediate medical attention when an allergic reaction occurs.  Why would airlines want to take that risk of such a disaster that could be easily avoided by banning all peanuts on planes?

My family and I were traveling a few months ago on US Air and peanuts/nuts were being sold. This was a shock to me because when I had asked at the gate about nuts being served the US Air employee had told me that no nuts were served. When I informed our stewardess of my child's nut allergy she told me that she had to offer them.  I was so stressed out thinking about the people around me who were eating those nuts and the possibility of my son having a severe allergic reaction that by far that was one of the most horrible flights I had been on.  After I exited the plane my husband and I decided that we would never fly that airline again because it was quite evident that the seriousness of my child's allergy was not a concern.

It may not be possible to guarantee that all food served on an airplane has not come in contact with nut products but at least by outlawing the serving or selling of peanuts as snacks, that would greatly decrease the possibility of severe/fatal allergic reactions.  There are a lot of other snacks that airlines can offer that their passengers would enjoy as an alternative to peanuts such as chips, cookies, etc.  Let's keep our children safe and able to travel free of worry.  We need to change with the times and outlawing peanuts on all flights is the only way to go.",,,,,,,

Because this allergy is life threatening, not simply a stomachache or runny nose, WHY not ban nuts from planes?!?!? People can find another healthy, protein filled snack to get them through a flight!

 It would be appropriate to require airlines to not serve any peanuts or peanut content items considering the sensitivity and severity of reactions with minimum exposure to peanuts or products processed in the same environment with peanuts.
Restrictions on these items would be appropriate to ensure the safety of all passengers and not take anything away from the service of refreshments.",,,,,,,

My child needs to eat on a set schedule and has her own food limitations.  If you were to ban all peanut products, families like mine would no longer be able to fly.

If we are talking about banning on keeping passengers informed and safe, I think those with allergies should have to comment on their needs when booking their flight so all other passengers can be informed of changes to that flight (like no nuts being served).

I am strongly opposed to Congress attempting to pass a bill that limits peanut consumption on airlines.  Although I sympathize with those who have allergies, it does not seem fair or right to ban something that technically does not create a disability. Perhaps the anti-peanut lobby can convince Congress to officially call a peanut allergy a disability. 

If Congress passes this bill, it creates more a of 'nanny' state where the government is trying to police the American public more.  That is the last thing our country needs right now. 

Southwest gets my business because they won't give into the anti-peanut demands and also charging overweight people for two seats (which all airlines should do).

Thank you,

When departing from the airport the plane must leave the ground within a certain period of time (less than an hour) or it should return to the gate and allow passangers to de-board the plane.  It this does not happen there should be a large fine paid by the airline plus compensation given to the paasengers.  The fine should also be assessed to the airport as it is not soley the airlines fault but it is also the fauld of the airport for allowing more traffic than it can actually handle.  Likewise when arriving at an airport and the plane has landed there should a limited amount of time before the plane must arrive at a gate and allow the passengers to de-board.  Again fines should be paid by the airline and the airport and compensation be given to the passengers.

On another note, I think the airlines should be made to provide more passenger room in the seats.  I am tired of being crammed into a seat for hours at a time with barely enough roo to wiggle a toe.  I find it very painful to try to jam my knees in the small spacce between my seat an the seat in front of me and if the person in that seat decides to try to recline their seat the pain becomes even worse as they try to force their seat to recline into my knees and my knees blocking the seat from reclining.  It is interesting that most adults I know have difficulty fitting into airline seats.  The seating area seems to be designed for children and not adults.  Not having enough room to move around in your seat and reposition yourself is a health hazard that can lead to blood clots.  I have even arrived hoome from a flight to find buises on my legs from the cramped quarters in the airline seats.",,,,,,,

    Yes, airlines should discontinue serving peanuts/peanut products on all flights as an accommodation to the persons who have severe peanut allergies; also in order to unify standards across the industry which are currently inconsistent and at times, ineffective; also raise quality between flight attendants and customers in order to minimize confusion, frustration, and general negativity; also to minimize exposure for peanut allergy suffers, while airlines may not be able to control food brought onto the flight, they can control the food they distribute and that is a milestone and standard for the public.

whether airlines should discontinue serving peanuts/peanut products ONLY on flights where a passenger with peanut allergy has notified the airline in advance;
         No; this is a current policy and very inconsistent. This causes confusion and frustration for the flight attendants, the people on board without food allergies, and the food allergy people. IT creates a hostile situation, not a good idea in confined spaces.

whether airlines should provide a ""buffer zone"" upon advance request by a passenger with peanut allergy;
         Unfortunately, no. Does not provide for the air circulation issue with severe allergies.

whether DOT should simply NOT issue any rule at all.
          Rules are necessary for society. To help set standards, to prevent problems, to help people of different perspectives to live together.

While I understand the concern here, I feel that this action is not necessary as individuals should take action to protect themselves.  Especially when they are fully aware that peanuts will be on the airplane.  While I do not have a peanut allergy, I do have asthma and an allergy to the dye Yellow #5.  This dye is in a very large amount of fragrance and lotion products used by women.  This creates a large amount of difficulties for me whenever I leave my home.  If I am exposed to this dye, even just smelling someone's lotion/perfume in passing, I have an asthma attack.  In addition to the asthma attack, I become lightheaded, cold, sluggish and start to slur my speech after extended time.  Because I am a responsible adult and am aware of my condition, I take precautions.  I rarely go to malls or movie theatres.  I tend to run my errands on off days/times to minimize my exposure to the allergen.  I carry a face mask that has a hepa and charcoal filter.  I wear the mask if I find myself in an area with a large concentration of perfume.  When I return home, I immediately launder my clothes and take a shower to remove the scent and residue.  How are these precautions any different than what someone with a peanut allergy would take?  As responsible, grown adults, we are responsible for our own safety when we have a unique situation (such as a peanut allergy, perfume sensitivity or any other condition that does not affect the public at large).  Make people take responsibility for their own conditions rather than inconvenience the entire public.  

If, however, you do decide to instate a policy to protect those with peanut allergies, I will expect a similar policy for people who have fragrance/perfume sensitivities.  I don't think you want to start instituting rules to protect every single condition that could possibly affect a human being ^^ Let people be responsible for themselves.",,,,,,,

I have 3 grandchildren who have peanut allergies and we have had much cooperation regarding the serving and cross contamination with peanuts from every establishment except the airlines.  This to me seems like a simple problem to tackle taking in to account the repercussions of an allergic response when in flight.  This is potentially a life and death situation.  I am sure there are many options for snacks instead of peanuts.  One thing that is often overlooked are the aerosols that can be emitted in an enclosed environment so limiting the serving of a peanut snack to several seats or rows would not help.  I plead with you to take this request very seriously for my family's safety and those of millions of others with the same allergies.
Thank you.",,,,,,,

I am the mother of a child with a severe allergy to peanuts.  I have tried to give her as normal of a life as possible, but I have found air travel to be, at best, difficult for her and, at worst, potentially life-threatening.  We typically fly Delta, which continues to serve peanuts and accommodates peanut allergies only by a 3 row buffer.  I have found the interior of Delta's planes to be completely covered in peanuts and peanut dust.  When I travel with my child, we have to completely sanitize the seats in our row, the seatbelts, the tray table, the switches - everything she may potentially touch.  We also have to put down a large blanket before she sits down.  Then, she feels embarrassed as flight attendants announce on the loudspeaker that they cannot serve peanuts in front of and in back of us due to her allergy.  She is humiliated as other passengers complain about their lack of snack selection due to her health problem.  When she was three, she experienced hives on an airplane which may have been due to peanut dust exposure.  I was terrified that she was about to have an anaphylactic reaction.  We notified the flight attendant and had the ambulance meet us at the gate when we landed.  Fortunately, we were able to treat her symptoms with Benadryl and did not need to use the epi-pen, but if she had been experiencing anaphylaxis and we couldn't get emergency medical treatment, the consequences could have been fatal.  It was the scariest moment of my life.  I know that airlines cannot prevent people from bringing peanuts on board, but if the airlines would stop serving raw peanuts, it would go a long way toward easing travel for peanut-allergic travelers.",,,,,,,

The biggest problem I see with air travel is the endless list of taxes and fees I am charged.  The airlines are making you pay extra for everything; some even have extra fees based on the seat you select even though every seat is ""economy class"".

First, I think that banning peanuts on flights is flat out ridiculous. The 'airborne peanut allergy scare', though scientifically baseless, has been overblown to no end by the rather vocal group of suburban parents who are apparently left wanting for drama in their lives.

There are many people who have severe shellfish allergies, arguably more life-threatening than most any peanut allergy, who have never asked restaurants to stop serving those items in and around their immediate area.

When is the last occurrence on record of a passenger suffering any type of a severe allergic reaction to peanuts, without actually eating them, on an aircraft? I am an airline pilot and in all my years, and through all the peanuts served every day on my airline, I have never seen this. I have, however, been witness to a couple of hysterical fits by over-protective parents regarding the issue.

Banning what has,is and shall continue to be a very healthy and convenient snack is preposterous, and shame on the DOT for allowing the politicization of what is essentially a non-issue.",,,,,,,

We were boarded 1st so we could explain to teh Flight Attendant the severity of the situation, she said she understood.  Our seats were in the last row of a smaller commuter plane and by the time the Flight Attendant reached two rows ahead of us we overhead her asking the passengers if they wanted peanuts, when she got to our row, we explained again that peanuts cuoldn't be served because of the allergy and she just said well I have a bag of pretzels for him.  We began using his inhaler and gave benadryl on the plane to counteract the peanut exposure, but By the time we landed and started heading home, we ended up taking a detour to the Emergency Room of our local hospital, where my son spent the next 3 days on oxygen and receiving treatments, all thanks to one ignorant Flight Attendant who served peanuts on a plane - even after she knew not to.  So to think that a study has to be done to see what the benefits would be to not allowing peanuts on a plane would be on peanut allergy sufferers - i can tell you - no stidy is needed, just learn from our experience.

The consequences of what can happen to a person going into shock are horrific, and I cant imagine how horrifying it would be to do so at 20,000 feet in the air.

I have been seriously allergic to peanuts all my life and those who are not understand the severity of the allergy.  All over the country there are seperate places that segregate smokers from non-smokers.  Would putting a smoker three rows ahead of someone in an aiplane prevent people three rows back from being affected by the smoke?  Probably not.

And whats the worst that could happen to a non-smoker breathing in smoke? A cough, a headache, lung cancer 45 years down the road.

An allergic reaction to peanuts is like a panic attack plus choking.  Many people are also under the false impression that an Epi-Pen is a magic cure all to treat shock.  An epi pen dose merely gives the victim time to get to a hospital to recieve further treatment.  How quick do you think a plane crossing the Atlantic can land to get a person treatment?

Also, I understand peanuts are a stable of flying, but smoking was a stable of our culture not 25 years ago and look at how quickly we have made seperate areas for all smokers.

My final argument is that there are literally hundreds of other options passengers could have other than peanutes- Doritos, Cheetos, Slim Jims, Pretzels, Twix, Kit Kat, Fun Yuns, Pop Corn, Health Bars, Sunflower Seeds, etc.  

I just have a problem when people say I have to have peanuts on this plane.  No, you don't.  There are a thousand other things you can bring on or the airline can serve.

The government wants to inconvenience 297 people because 3 people are at risk?  That's preposterous.  Individuals who are at risk should notify the airline BEFORE they fly so they can be suitably accomodated - either by being seated in a 'peanut-free zone' or by a collaborative effort with nearby passengers to ensure safety.  Banning peanuts from all flights is a bit extreme.  Personally, I think that many people who 'suffer' from these allergies are not knowledgeable enough about their own health to be out in public anyway.  It's not the public's problem to deal with it.  Get real. . . . .",,,,,,,

Most airlines do not provide meals for continental flights anymore, which leaves the passengers to pack food for the flight.  As a mother of two young children, packing peanut butter and jelly is a staple for our flights. It is substantial, healthy, and does not require refrigeration.  Hungry kids are grumpy kids, and nobody likes grumpy kids on a plane.
Another point I would like to make is that there are many people who are allergic to many things.  If this becomes a regulation then where does it stop?  What's next? Dairy? Wheat? Pets?  Flowers?  Perfume?  Dr.'s note signifying the passenger is free from a contagious illness?
ALL passengers should feel free to fly comfortably.  Some of the comfort is the responsibility of the airline, and some is of the passenger. Ultimately if a person has such a severe allergy then THEY are responsible of ensuring that they are safe, NOT the rest of the world.",,,,,,,

Many people have a variety of allergies.  My daughter is allergic to gluten, corn syrup and artificial flavors/fragrances.  If you ban peanuts on flights what are the airlines going to serve instead?  Gluten based products.  Peanuts are the only snack served on airplanes that people w/ gluten allergies can eat.  There are probably as many people w/ gluten allergies as peanut allergies.  I think it is selfish of people w/ peanut allergies to say that no one else on board can eat peanuts.  If their allergy is life threatening, they should have someone pre-board to clean the area around their seat.  They can wear gloves so as not to touch anything contaminated. Create a buffer row behind and in front.  But for goodness sake what about the people in that buffer zone that preselected seats that have gluten allergies?  Airlines and the allergic passengers should carry epi-pens / emergency allergy relief treatments.  Does the whole world need to reorder itself for the 1% (not all of which fly) of the population that have peanut allergies?  This is unfair to 99% of the population.",,,,,,,

My daughter and I are both allergic to peanuts. She has more serious reactions than I do. When flying, the flight attendant usually just tries to hand me packages of peanuts without even asking. I try to catch them as quickly as possible to request something different. However, I still am usually sitting next to someone that is eating peanuts along with most of the people on the plane. The plane is then filled with the smell of peanuts and peanut dust in the air. I try to keep from inhaling the smell as much as possible. Peanuts should not be allowed in an enclosed area such as an airplane. I think that all airlines should ban providing peanuts to their customers.

This impacts not only my personal life, but limits my job prospects.  I am a buyer, and travel is frequently required of purchasing positions.  Over the years I have limited my jobs to only those which do not require travel.
Even with emergency treatment with an epi pen, the reaction can come back within an hour.  I don't believe most flights would be capable of handling that type of situation.  Until peanuts are banned from flights, I will use other methods of transportation.
Please consider how these type of allergies affect people.  I  believe the largest part of the problem is the oily residue which cannot always be seen, but can be deadly.

I am an Air Traffic Controller and a father of a severely peanut allergic child.  I support a total ban of peanuts from flights.  Per 14 CFR Part 382, if a person’s allergy is sufficiently severe to substantially limit a major life activity (such as breathing), then that person meets the definition of an individual with a disability.  Exposure of allergic individuals to minute amounts of peanut can cause difficulty breathing and can be life threatening.  The Agency must respect this issue and recognize the growing population with this disability.  

Reactions have occurred on aircraft, and are more likely without a ban.  An EPI-Pen can sustain life until one can get to the nearest hospital –but it wears off within 20 minutes.  Emergency landing can ensue.  This would be horrific for the family, as well as being disruptive to the fellow passengers, the airline, and to air traffic.  In some areas, and trans-oceanic flights, this is impossible to do promptly.  This is preventable by banning peanuts on aircraft.  To allow preventable emergencies runs counter to the Agency’s mission of safe, orderly, and expeditious flight.  

Smoking was once allowed on flights until the health risks to fellow passengers were recognized.  Like smoke, peanut allergen can be airborne.  A peanut-free zone in an aircraft cabin makes as little sense as a smoke-free zone.  And allergic individuals might need to cross through peanut zones to use bathrooms.  

There is no need to allow peanuts on flights.  If people can wait a few hours for a highly addictive cigarette, they can wait just as long to eat peanuts.  There are plenty of other safe foods that can be eaten in the meantime.  

Our family has encountered airlines that do not respect 14 CFR Part 382, and we are not alone.  It is time for a uniform ban.  This logical choice would bring safety and peace of mind to peanut allergic families, some of whom could finally travel for the first time.",,,,,,,

Not only do you have to worry about peanuts on the flight you are on but peanuts and residue from previous flights. We have to wipe down everything when we get on an airplane now so that our child is not exposed to any peanuts.

We have to worry about peanut dust in the air with recirculating air in the airplane. If there was enough peanut dust in the air of the plane, however unlikely that might be, it could still set of an allergic reaction. 

It seems such an easy solution for airlines to choose to use another snack food or nothing at all during a flight than to use peanuts. It is ridiculous that it is going to take an in flight emergency or death and millions of dollars in law suit damages for someone to make a change on simple issue. 

The only reason that there are not many emergencies so far is that people who know they are allergic take many precautions, but it only takes one time for someone who doesn;t know to have a reaction and that would be very bad.

I realize that this change would not stop a passenger from carrying on his or her own peanuts, but that situation does not pose as much of a risk to an allergic individual. There is a big difference between one passenger opening a bag of peanuts in a closed airline cabin and 150 doing so. The amount of peanut protein that would be released into the air if all passengers were served peanuts is much greater than if one passenger happened to bring some peanuts onboard. 

Our family does not typically ask for accommodations due to our son's peanut allergy. For example, we would not expect alrlines to serve nut-free meals. We would simply bring our own safe food for our son on a long flight. Having other passengers nearby eating foods that contain nut products would not pose a risk. It is only when peanut proteins are released into the air, as they would be when a number of people opened bags of peanuts in a closed environment, that the risk is intolerable. 

We have only flown once with our child because of our concern, and we chose an airline that did not serve peanuts. We take other forms of transportation whenever possible, but sometimes that just is not practical. We would certainly fly more often if peanuts were not served on airlines.

Having a fellow passenger have a life-threatening allergic reaction onboard would be much more unpleasant and inconvenient for a traveler and an airline than simply choosing one of the many alternative snack options available.",,,,,,,

In the case of peanuts, banning unshelled peanuts from flights is reasonable as long as cabins maintain a peanut-free zone in the seating area.  Shelled peanuts have virtually no chance of introducing airborne allergens into the cabin and separate seating zones virtually eliminates cross contamination risks.
<BR><BR>
As a budget-conscious flier, spending even a single dollar in the cabin has some (albeit minimal in the case of $1) impact on my decision to fly with an airline or fly at all.  I should have the ability to purchase whatever kind(s) of food I want past the security checkpoint for the purpose of taking it on-board the aircraft.
<BR><BR>
Also bear in mind, no amount of precautions on board an aircraft can prevent exposure to allergens.  Someone could eat peanut butter with their fingers and board a flight without ever washing their hands, touching every conceivable surface on the way to their seat.  I admit that the example is extreme, but I hope my point is made.
<BR><BR>
As for Kosher foods and other dietary restrictions, generally speaking I see no issue with having in-flight meals conform to a small variety of these restrictions.  Requiring all meals to conform to any one specific type is inexcusable.  Not all kosher meals are vegetarian, some vegetarian meals are not vegan, etc.  I believe that passengers should be accomodated if they notify the airline before the flight date of any special dietary needs, but they should be prepared to pay a premium for the service.",,,,,,,

U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop (D-Albany) called this DOT proposal ""another example of extreme government regulation.” I finally agree with something a democrat said.

Here’s a novel thought; if you’re allergic to peanuts you most likely know this by now. So….DON’T EAT THEM! Don’t eat them on a plane or on train or in a boat or with a goat or in a car or in a bar Sam I Am – seriously Dr. Suess makes better sense than our U.S. Government. If you’re allergic to peanuts, simply don’t eat them and certainly refuse them when offered. DUH! But don’t ban the iconic staple from the vast majority of us who are not “disabled.”  

Since when is a food allergy a disability? Who came up with that analogy?  Where has common sense gone in this nation??

“Peanut-free zone??” Seriously? I want to have an Idiot-free-zone.

“Peanut measures”?? What the heck are those? Will we now require separate laws for peanuts? What’s next? Will peanuts be removed from public sale because an allergic person has rights to go into a grocery store unencumbered by his or her “disability?” Will peanuts be put on some toxic list with special HazMat restrictions for sale and distribution? Will I have to have a special license to buy peanuts?

What are we going to do next; regulate hot dogs out of ball parks because they’re full of fat and can lead to heart attacks and strokes? Cotton candy from state fairs? Beer from beer gardens?

Eating or not eating peanuts is a matter of personal choice, not an regulatory affair. The DOT should stay out of this and let the Airlines self-regulate on something so simple.",,,,,,,

I understand peanut allergies, at worse, are life threatening and, at best, are uncomfortable for the sufferer.  I do not suffer from a peanut allergy and while I have sympathy for those who do -- where do we draw the line?  How can you stop people from bringing any kind of food on a flight with the potential of having peanuts in it or cooked near it etc?  For short flights, 1 hour or less, it makes good sense to ban peanut snacks and ask the public not to eat their own peanut based snacks (or food of any kind) --- but this practice and policy would be impractical for longer flights.  Personally, I don't want to eat crackers, gold fish, pretzels (I have sensitivity to wheat) as substitutes for trail mix or a bag of nuts.  Needless to say, this is not life threatening and I could refrain from eating these snacks on long flights, I wouldn't starve or die, but what about children on long flights, who don't have peanut allergies?  Would you deny or limit their parent's ability to provide foods to their liking?  I don't know the answer but I don't feel my position makes me insensitive, as most peanut allergy sufferers might contend. This issue is not easy to decide and must be thought out carefully.",,,,,,,

I am an Air Traffic Controller and a father of a severely peanut allergic child.  I support a total ban of peanuts from flights.  Per 14 CFR Part 382, if a person’s allergy is sufficiently severe to substantially limit a major life activity (such as breathing), then that person meets the definition of an individual with a disability.  Exposure of allergic individuals to minute amounts of peanut can cause difficulty breathing and can be life threatening.  The Agency must respect this issue and recognize the growing population with this disability.  

Reactions have occurred on aircraft, and are more likely without a ban.  An EPI-Pen can sustain life until one can get to the nearest hospital –but it wears off within 20 minutes.  Emergency landing can ensue.  This would be horrific for the family, as well as being disruptive to the fellow passengers, the airline, and to air traffic.  In some areas, and trans-oceanic flights, this is impossible to do promptly.  This is preventable by banning peanuts on aircraft.  To allow preventable emergencies runs counter to the Agency’s mission of safe, orderly, and expeditious flight.  

Smoking was once allowed on flights until the health risks to fellow passengers were recognized.  Like smoke, peanut allergen can be airborne.  A peanut-free zone in an aircraft cabin makes as little sense as a smoke-free zone.  And allergic individuals might need to cross through peanut zones to use bathrooms.  

There is no need to allow peanuts on flights.  If people can wait a few hours for a highly addictive cigarette, they can wait just as long to eat peanuts.  There are plenty of other safe foods that can be eaten in the meantime.  

Our family has encountered airlines that do not respect 14 CFR Part 382, and we are not alone.  It is time for a uniform ban.  This logical choice would bring safety and peace of mind to peanut allergic families, some of whom could finally travel for the first time.",,,,,,,

We would advise the airlines of the peanuts allergy issue ahead of time and, frankly, the new ruling does not offer much comfort.  We were hoping that that peanuts/peanuts related products would eventually be banned completely on commercial airlines -- that the flight would be a peanuts-free experience.  We thought the airlines were moving in the right direction, unfortunately, it seems that powerful lobbying by the peanuts manufacturers have succeeded in reversing the trend.
I hope that enough parents/families like ourselves will voice our concern and that DOT would reexamine this life and death issue for some of us.  Thank you for reading my comments.

I have a nephew who will go into anaphylactic shock if he walks into a room where there are peanuts, or speaks with someone who has been eating peanuts.
Since smoking was banned on planes and the airlines took advantage of that to reduce the fresh air factor and recirculate more, surely the allergy issues must have become worse ?

Being trapped on the tarmac in a stifling plane is a living hell and should be limited to 90 minutes during which time the airline must provide working lavatories and air-conditioning.  After that time passengers should be allowed to deplane and re-book their flight with no penalty (unless weather-related).  The rules should apply to all carriers.  I think the 3 hour rule is too lenient but it is better than nothing.  There should also be legal recourse if the rule isn't followed by the airline

Denied boarding comp:
Yes, the compensation should be increased to reflect inflation, etc.  Zero-fare passengers should be compensated by vouchers using the same basis for comp.  Volunteers should receive the same compensation as involuntary bumpees and they should be informed of how long they will be delayed---they have a right to know what they are volunteering for.
Passengers must be informed of their rights in writing.  I would like to see signs at every gate which airline employees can refer to when bumping people.  I like the check-in time method of bumping.

One-way fare advertising:
A one-way fare should be a one-way fare with no strings attached.
I also agree with you that airline advertising rules need to be more stringent with hidden costs disclosed.

Flight delay info:
Airlines must disclose any delay over 30 minutes by every means at their disposal and absolutely on the arrival boards.  I was on a flight delayed for over 2 hours at the gate and the delay was never posted at the arrival airport---in fact they took the flight completely off the board( which scared the bejeezus out of the waiting families).

Peanuts:
People with severe allergies are responsible for managing themselves not the government.  Otherwise you will hear from people with perfume allergies, chemical sensitivities etc.  If they are too sick to be in public, then they shouldn't be flying.",,,,,,,

Coming up with a standard list of services to be provided and then asking each airline to include these in each ticket price would provide a more transparent way of comparing actual travel costs. Let's assume that the standard list might include: cost of flying from Point A to Point B, hauling one bag, one non-alcoholic beverage, and one blanket. Each airline would then price each item. The price for a ticket from Point A to Point B would include the cost of all these standard items. From that point on, a traveler would know that he could expect the same services to be provided by each airline for its advertised ticket price -- thus providing for fairer, more transparent shopping. The way airlines are now charging -- on service-for-fee options because it permits the airline to sell customers on the value of the services -- could led to ridiculous charges. I can foresee airlines deciding in the future that they ought to charge for wings on airplanes, tires so that planes can land safely, pilots who fly planes, etc. There are basic services that ought to be provided without charge and one of these should be toilet facilities. To charge for going to the bathroom would be to regress to the days of pay toilets in this country -- which was a veiled way to discriminate against the poor.",,,,,,,

When you have a severe peanut allergy it is not just a matter of not eating peanuts, the peanut dust, which can be circulated throughout the whole plane via the ventilation system, and the oils, which are in the seat cushions and on the surrounding surfaces are also a threat.
 We can choose to avoid certain situations, like dinning in a Chinese restaurant, and make personal accommodation, like changing tables in a lunchroom.  However, when locked in a plane there are no other alternatives when you have 20 minutes or less to get medical attention in an emergency.

  I am writing a comment regarding the consideration of peanuts in air travel and airline passenger protection. Food allergies, including peanuts, affect up to 12 million Americans, with two of those affected being my children. Peanut allergies are a serious and life-threatening condition of which no cure exists. Although people with allergens must take precautions in their own health and environment for optimal protection, air travel can not be avoided. Peanut-free airline travel should be an option, either by simply removing the food completely, or be offering select flights as ""allergy safe"". Please keep in mind that peanut dust and residue can remain in circulation, on surfaces, and harbor in fabric, creating an unsafe environment even if peanuts are out in the open at the time of flight. Emergency management with epinephrine is crucial to saving the life during an anaphylaxis reaction; however, secondary reactions may occur hours later, being equally as dangerous. Medical treatment would be difficult in over seas flights.

On a personal note, our son experienced a reaction following a short, one-hour flight where peanuts were served. No one in our row at the peanuts, however, the dust was in the air. By the time we landed, he had swelling in the eyes and was wheezing, requiring more medication to combat the effects. What was supposed to be an enjoyable time quickly turned into a vacation spent with extra medications, breathing treatments, itching, and a rash significant enough he could not go into the ocean or pool without pain. Our family loves to travel both domestic and internationally, on business and for pleasure, however, we must do careful consideration before bringing our children onto another flight. I am sure many other families with peanut-allergies feel the same way, as one reaction is one too many. 

Thank you for your consideration in the elimination of peanuts in airline travel.

Four years ago, we were flying to California on a morning flight.  We asked, and the airline said they were not serving peanuts on the flight.  During the flight, my son (6 years old at the time) became lethargic and struggled to breathe.  I asked around and found out that the woman behind us had just opened a bag of peanuts that she brought on for the flight.  He had an anaphylactic reation to the peanut dust.  We landed in Colorado, which was the closest airport, in 45 minutes, and he was rushed to the nearest hospital.  Luckily he was OK this time.  We had to rent a car and drive home to New Jersey, never reaching our destination of California, and never flying with him again.  

Due to the increasing prevalence of peanut allergies, and the severity of the reaction, I believe peanuts should be banned from flights just as smoking was many years ago.  If this is impossible, there should be stipulations that some flights are completely peanut free so peanut allergic people have the opportunity to live normal lives.

If there needs to be a study to pursue this action, I would be happy to share our story or help in any way to make this possible.

At the very minimum, a comprehensive list of fees or potential fees should accompany the offer purchase price before checkout.  It is very dubious and even unethical to reveal extra charges after the ticket has been purchased.

Quite frankly, I think that airlines shouldn't charge all these extra fees for odds and end.  If they need extra revenue, they should simply raise ticket prices, but make their prices all-inclusive.  If all airlines operated that way, we the consumers could make a very clear and informed decision about tickets because the comparison would always be apples to apples.

The idea that ""cafeteria style"" pricing does the consumer a favor is a fiction.  Since the institution of baggage-check fees, nearly everyone carries on baggage, which leads to massively slowed down boarding.  There is more air rage and disputes over overhead bins and gate-checking of baggage.  And it is simply safer for baggage to go in the cargo hold rather than risk falling out of an overhead bin in the event of turbulence.",,,,,,,

We informed American Airlines before we bought tickets that someone is going to be traveling with this contion.  American Airlines told us that they will not serve nuts on our flight and they would take precautions to help us.  Like wiping down trays, seats and buttons for us before we entered the plane.  Also to make others aware that someone on flight had this allegic condition.  THEY LIED!!!!!!!
Maria... first flight attentant did not know about us(even when we talked to the people at the gate about this).  She stated that she does not serve nuts on the flight....and then makes an anouncement to the plane that she will be selling bags of trail mix with almonds and nuts for $3.00.  
Joyce...  on second flight refused to make any anoucement and stating that platium members can have almonds if they want too.  And told us if we dont feel safe to get off the plane.
Im absolutly disgusted with that air line and will never fly them again.

Not only will banning peanuts be a life saving measure, but also a time saving measure for the other passengers on the flight.  If a person does have a life-threatening reaction in the air, I would assume the flight would be diverted to a near airport to provide medical treatment.  This would only delay travel for everyone else on the flight.  

Eliminating peanuts from the flights is the most simple risk mitigation plan that can be implemented.  If the airlines take some time to do a risk identification and assessment, they would quickly see that mitigating the risk of allergic reaction is far more effective and less costly than taking a chance while mid-air.",,,,,,,

Twice we have flown on American Airlines and USAirways and I have attempted to alert flight attendants upon boarding at the entrance that my son was severely allergic.  Both times they just  nodded their heads and did nothing.  The first time a husband and wife sat next to us and opened a large family sized bag of Spanish peanuts.  They proceeded to eat it during the entire flight and I had to turn our vents off, cover my then 1 year old baby's face wtih a blanket for a 2 hour flight to Dallas, and pray that there would be no reaction.  The attendants said ""we are NOT a peanut free airline and we cannot restrict what our passengers eat.""  The second time on USAirways, a man 2 seats away opened a 3 cup bag of trail mix to share with his wife.  I spent the first 1/2 hour in a panic because I had called ahead of time and been told by the airline that no special accomodations could be made for my son, then 18 months old.  Finally I could stand it no longer and I appealed to the woman whose husband was holding the trail mix, telling her of my son's allergies.  She had her husband put it away.  You have no idea the anxiety and upset this can cause especially with a young child who cannot say ""My throat is closing up, I am choking, I can't breathe.""  

This is such a small accomodation.  There are literally thousands of other things people can choose to eat in a short period of a few hours.  Asking them not to eat peanuts is not a serious ordeal.  If your child was allergic to an apple and I knew that, I would NEVER cut one up and sit 9"" from your child and spend 2 hours eating it.  And I would not mind one bit if you asked me to put it away.  If you made it a rule beforehand I would simply bring an orange on board for a snack. How can you people take such a casual view of what could lead to a persons' DEATH and what is so simple to avoid?  I think it is shameful.  Please change it.",,,,,,,

One time on a Southwest plane, my son got hives all over his chin after touching something with nut residue in the aircraft.  He also began sneezing repeatedly.

We urge airplanes NOT to surve nuts on airplanes.  As for a total ban, it might be most reasonable and still significantly reduce the risk to allergic individuals to let passangers bring a snack containing nuts if they wish but NOT to serve the masses nuts.

It can take just one speck of peanut dust to cause someone to go into anaphylactic shock shock during which a person can die within minutes of exposure. No one get it until they have been personally touched by the condition - it's serious.

No one has an urgent need to eat peanuts on a plane. However, restricting this very dangerous culprit of food allergies is a SMALL, SIMPLE AND VERY MEANINGFUL way to protect a child (and adult) while in the air. 

The current system is extremely dangerous. First, airplanes are not clean. Peanut dust, droppings and remnants can be found everywhere including back trays, in the seat pockets, windows and on the floor. It would only take the simple act of my son to touch a remnant - be that nut or dust - with his hand and then proceed to expose that to his mouth or inhale dust for him to have a reaction.

And passengers have other options. Delta serves peanuts, cookies and pretzels. However, my request a week ago on our way back from Jamaica to not serve the peanuts was met with extreme resistance by Delta. It wasn't until I broke down in tears and explained to them what could happen- someone dying or the pilot being forced to make an emergency landing - that they finally decided to just serve the cookies and pretzels. Passengers didn't know the difference. (And wouldn't grounding a plane because of an anaphylactic reaction be more of an inconvenience than just not serving nuts?) 

Delta touts its ""buffer zone"" but that's completely ineffective. As one person said, ""There is a blatant safety problem with the current system of only restricting peanuts in the three rows in front and behind a person with a serious peanut allergy. People drop food when they eat. The nuts don’t seem to know that they must stay within their allotted zone.""

It's a food choice versus a LIFE. We need to keep ALL PERSONS safe in the air. It's a right.",,,,,,,

Since when is the right to be served and eat peanuts more imporant than a life. For all of those individuals that think it's o.k. to serve peanuts on a plane, imagine yourself being 30,000 feet in the air when a child that is exposed to peanuts begins to cough, wheeze and eventually becomes unable to breathe. Yes, administering an EpiPen will diffuse the reaction, but only for 20 minutes. Which means while you are enjoying your packet of peanuts expecting to get to your destination on time, you will be diverting to the closest airport so your anaphylactic passenger can be unloaded and sent to the nearest emergency room. Is a packet of peanuts on your flight really that important to you? Wouldn't pretzels do? And to the airline industry, I don't fly with my children because you don't have a policy regarding peanuts. And trust me, a peanut buffer zone isn't going to provide me any protection with recycled air being piped through the cabin. Allergies are on the rise and I know plenty of people that won't fly because of it. If you established a no-peanut policy, do you honestly think people would stop flying? The answer is no. However those people that you've been missing out on the plane fares for because of their allergies would be more comfortable with flying. Step up and make a policy that would benefit the growing number of people that suffer from life threatening allergies. Business will be better for it. And for those people who absolutely must have their peanuts on a flight, why don't you try driving to all your distant destinations for a while. And see if you still need your packet of peanuts at the end of the day.",,,,,,,

Frisch LLC","N/A",,,"DOT","Federal","I write this comment to the proposed rulemaking as a concerned consumer who regularly purchases airline tickets.  The proposed rules concerning consumer advertising and dealing with the trend toward the unbundling of services are an encouraging first start.  In the last several years, as internet advertising has blossomed, airlines and other sellers of tickets have used various marketing techniques to disguise the true price of the tickets they are selling, so that comparison shopping has become virtually impossible.  The use of various fees and separating out tax charges no longer serves any purpose other than to confuse potential customers. 
	Recently, I have been searching for tickets to Paris and the range of advertised prices has shocked me, especially considering the actual fares that exist once you click through the various screens you discover that similar classes of tickets have very similar prices.  One email advertising campaign led me to believe that a round trip fare to Paris was approximately $400, an incredibly low price, but then added on approximately $485 in so called “fees and taxes.”  Continental.com, the official website of Continental Airlines added $180 per ticket for “taxes and fees” while some websites, such as Kayak.com and Bing.com Travel had no trouble displaying actual fares. 
	Considering that each of these websites immediately displays the full fare when you attempt to purchase the ticket, there does not appear to be any technical reason why the fares cannot be advertised at their full price.  As it is, airline pricing is difficult, confusing and changes frequently; consumers need the protections of the proposed rule and then some.  Furthermore, if I am buying other items online, comparison sites easily show me the price inclusive of all taxes and shipping fees, airlines should be no different.",,,,,,,

She explained her situation to the passenger, who, upon hearing it replied, ""Too bad, I'm hungry.""

Altering the current airline policies, will protect the lives of those with peanut allergies, with very little impact to other passengers.  Passengers, for the most part, will readily understand this infrequent situation.  

Current airline policies regarding passengers with peanut allergies effectively deny these persons the ability to fly.  While many airlines include in their policies the statement that they will not serve peanuts on their flights, they will take no action to curtail consumption by passengers who have brought them on board.  In fact, many airlines’ policies include statements to the effect that “Persons with peanut allergies must decide whether airline travel is right for them.”  Given the fatal consequences of exposure, many are therefore denied the ability to utilize air travel.  In the interest of making air travel available to this currently disenfranchised group of allergy sufferers, I recommend that rules be enacted to accomplish the following:  (1) Airlines will not serve peanuts, peanut butter or peanut products as in-flight snacks; (2) Upon receipt of a request by a ticketed passenger on a specific flight, cabin attendants will announce that a person with a peanut allergy is on the flight, and state that consumption of peanuts or peanut products will not be allowed on that flight.  Airline personnel must, of course, have the authority to enforce that restriction.

Thanks for considering this very important topic.",,,,,,,

Please help protect citizens that have up to this point been Trapped and at the mercy of the airlines.

1.    The first airline passenger protection regulation is working very well.  (Delays in the first months of implementation down from 563 to 7, compared to previous year's same three months).

2.    DOT's argument in the NPRM for extending those regulatory requirements to the U.S. international operations of foreign flag carriers is strong and persuasive.

3.    DOT must promptly require that all extra fees be disclosed up front, so that we can compare the true total costs of competing carriers' fares.

4.    DOT regulatory action to protect airline passengers is particularly important because Congress has prohibited by, statute state, and local governments from regulating in these areas.

5.    FlyersRights.org urges that DOT publish the final regulation based on this NPRM by year's end, with an effective date for full carrier compliance no more than 120 days later.",,,,,,,

It is very clear that many airline passengers have been mistreated. Small children being held on a plane for hours is cruel. It is very different for adults who can sit for hours, but small children need to move and run. Children should be allowed to deplane when the airplane can not take off for hours.

She was diagnosed at 16 months of age when she went into anaphylaxis after eating one tiny bite of a peanut butter cookie.

Flying with her has been concerning because of the abundance of peanuts, in particular, on domestic US flights.  Because peanuts are small and can drop or break into crumbly pieces, we have noticed them all over airplanes in some hard to clean places (and some not so hard to clean ones, like floors).  Imagine how difficult it is to expect a toddler of one or two years to understand not to touch the parts of their airplane seat, the seatback pocket, the grooves between the seats, the casing around the airplane windows.  Now that she is five, she is better able to understand the potential danger of coming into peanut pieces found in any of those spaces.  Prior to this year, she was just too young to be expected to refrain from the naturally curious exploring fingers of toddlerhood.

The presence of peanut pieces on airplanes can present a true, life-threatening emergency for someone like my daughter.  If one of those pieces ends up on her fingers, all it takes is for her to wipe her eyes or touch her nostrils or near her mouth and that food particle is introduced into her body through her mucous membrane.  This kind of reflexive touching is something we all do to our own faces and bodies every day without ever having to give it a second thought.  For my daughter, this simple natural action could be fatal if her fingers happened upon traces of peanuts before.

Why risk creating a life-threatening emergency on airplanes, where emergency response time would be delayed?  Simply keeping peanuts off of airplanes would minimize the risk from this potentially deadly allergy.  It would alleviate the risk from human error when an individual employee may not clean well after a flight.  It would correct for certain airlines that don't seem to prioritize cleaning debris.",,,,,,,

The flight from CT to FL and return were disastrous.  Over the phone, they promised to make an announcement about not eating nuts on the plane, and promised to not serve the cashews, but then they said they had a rule change, and they were doing a buffer zone, one row in front and one row behind my son, just his side of the plane, and they served the cashews.  My son had a horrible reaction, and his throat was so sore, that I took him to the Emergency Clinic, and they even did a throat culture, to check for strep, because it was so irritated from the nuts on the plane.  Our entire dream vacation to Disney was ruined, because Jet Blue had to serve cashews on the plane.  On the return flight, same deal, cashews served and passengers eating nutty products, and my son was even more severely sick when he got home, and it took several trips to the Dr. before he was feeling better.  Of course, there is no way to prove that he had an inhalation reaction, but he has never had such a severe throat irritation, and has also never been in such an enclosed area, where people were eating nuts, so I feel that he did have an inhalation reaction, both going to FL and on the return flight.  I was furious with Jet Blue, and even had the employee number of the person who gave me the wrong information.  I did an online complaint to Jet Blue, and did not even receive a response that they received my complaint, never mind someone who actually cared what happened to my son.  I entered the complaint in May 2010, four months ago.  I also had trip insurance, and I am filing a claim with them.  We'll see what they have to say about this, and if this is something that they will even cover.  As I said, my son was so sick from the flight that he didn't even want to go to the theme parks, didn't want to go out to dinner and just wanted to stay in bed.  Something must be done about this!",,,,,,,

Ever since the day we found out that our son has this life threatening condition, we have not traveled.  From past experiences we know that nuts are sometimes offered aboard airplanes and this would cause a dangerous situation that we are not willing to risk.  Our son is at a very young age and has had to give up some of lives simplest pleasures because of his allergies.  His doctor has stongly recommended that he attend a circus show or even a baseball game because of his condition.  He is small yet understands that he cannot share a birthday cake at his friends birthday party unless I have read all the ingredients and done the proper research to make sure he will be safe.  He cannot eat certain candy and cannot have ice cream other than soft serve.  He cannot enjoy sprinkles nor M&M's.  He misses his grandparent that live overseas and would live to visit them however we know that this would be too much of a risk for him.  His allergy has made him mature and understand his condition.  Everyday is a struggle to make sure that he is not near anyone who is eating a snickers, butterfinger or even a peanut butter and jelly sandwich because the particles in the air could cause him to go into anaphalactic shock.  I don't expect the world to peanut free but if the DOT can discontinue the distributution of nuts on their flights it would make it possible for him to visit his grandparents with a little peace of mind.  In an airplane where the air is circulated the risk is higher.  I just plead with you to consider all the individuals with nut allergies as you would a handicap person and accomodate them.   Have a nut elsewhere just as the government has banned cigarette smoking from restaurants.  Second hand smoke is not as deadly as an anaphalactic shock.  Please consider those with this uncontrollable condition.",,,,,,,

In years past, I could call the airline in advance of arrival tell them my flight number and allergy and they would arrange to serve pretzels or other non-peanut snack and would make an announcement pre-flight re if you brought peanuts or peanut product on board to refrain from eating until reach the destination.

Most recently the airlines, even with peanut free policies have stated to me upon check in that I should consider wether flying is an option as they are not willing to make announcement pre-flight.

I would like to see a protection enforced of truly having a peanut free airline trip.  Today they have classrooms that are peanut free when a student has severe allergy, they have peanut guide dogs to keep the person free of trouble and peanut free restaurants.  I would like the airlines to consider
joining the others who have recognized the need to enact and enforce peanut free conditions.

Thank you for your consideration and the chance to have input.

While acknowledging that there is a percentage of the population that have peanut allergies, the overall percentage with those allergies is minimal compared to those who do not have allergies. A total ban would cause hardships and added expenses for those who would or need to choose those snacks during their layovers if they were unable to bring their own supply due to the airlines and airport vendors insistence on charging up to 50% more for the same items purchased outside the airport.  It also causes added expense to those who are merely transporting them from one location to another by forcing them to pay a checked bag fee or shipping costs to get their purchases from one location to another.

What about bans on individuals with too much colongne or perfume - pet hair, etc. Many individuals including myself have severe allergies to these items coupled with asthma which is also a life-threatening condition that can and frequently does end in death.  I choose to fly prepared and take the risks into consideration when I fly.  

A total ban of peanuts on flights still does not mitigate the potential for reaction or death to those who are allergic when they encounter the people in the airline terminals eating nuts in the gate area, concourse, or anywhere else for that matter. 

I still support that airlines need to self-enforce and better train their attendants to respond appropriately to passengers who notify them of peanut allergies. 

Reminding the commission that this would all be a moot point and discussion had one airline and its attendants taken one mother and her son's healt issues seriously and enforced a no-peanut flight. Its the one bad action from one agent/individual that is dictating the outcome for literally hundreds of thousands. Correcting the bad action and reinforcing the training better serves the safety of the flying public.",,,,,,,

We don't allow weapons on a plane to someone that has an allergy to peanuts this is just a different type of weapon.

Protect those that have such allergies.

Docket No. DOT-OST-2010-0140

Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections

 
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen at the U.S. Department of Transportation:
 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment in response to the above identified proposed regulations.  More specifically, item 12 of the preamble to the above described proposed regulations invites comments regarding greater access to air travel for individuals with severe peanut allergies.  This comment addresses soley this issue.
 
My eight year old child has severe, life-threatening peanut and tree nut allergies.  A plan pursuant to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, has been developed for my child relating to these severe food allergies.  The section 504 plan, among other things, designates his public elementary school as a nut-free facility and prohibits all peanut and tree nuts from being consumed at the facility.  


My child has not flown on an airplane solely because peanut and tree nut products (1) are served to passengers on airplanes by air carriers and (2) are allowed to be consumed on airplances by passengers (who provide their own nut products).   My child has not flown on an aircraft solely because of health concerns related to peanut and tree nut service on aircrafts.
 
My nephew, who is nine years old, also suffers from severe peanut and tree nut allergies.  When he was approximately five years old he boarded an aircraft with his immediate family.  He was wearing short plants as his family was traveling to a warm weather climate during the winter season.  Immediately after sitting in his seat on the aircraft, hives began to form all over his legs.  Presumably a previous passenger sitting in that seat had consumed a peanut or tree nut product and wiped his/her hands containing the peanut/tree nut residue on the seat, and the seat was not adequately cleaned after this usage.  The airplane containing my nephew was in the process of taxing down the runway for takeoff.   Because of the start of my nephew's allergic reaction, the aircraft made an emergency diversion back to the gate.  At the gate my nephew and his family disembarked the aircraft and immediately proceeded to a local hospital.    
 
The plane's emergency diversion disrupted the flight for the remaining passengers and undoubtedly delayed the arrival time of the flight at its intended destination.  Because a prior passenger on that aircraft was allowed to consume, and did consume, a peanut/tree nut product, passengers on my nephew's flight on that aircraft were inconvenienced because the airplane had to make an emergency diversion to the airport gate.   This experience shows that the issue is not whether airplane passengers should be inconvenienced by a nut restriction policy - but rather how airplane passengers are going to be inconvenienced on aircrafts: (a) are they going to be inconvenienced by not being able to consume peanuts or tree nuts or (b) are they going to be inconvenienced by having their flight disrupted and delayed because an individual suffers an allergic reaction because consumption of these food products was allowed to occur?


Solely because of health concerns related to peanut and tree nut service on aircrafts, my nephew and his immediate family have not flown on an aircraft since that occurrence.
 
Lack of flying on aircrafts because of health concerns related to peanut and tree nut service by those with severe nut allergies - and their families - results in lost revenue to air carriers and airport vendors, affecting interstate commerce among other things.  This lack of flying also shows that those who believe they are most at risk for nut allergic reactions do not fly or at the very least minimize their flying experiences.  If there are any studies or data suggesting that past experience shows that consumption of nuts on airplanes is no or little risk, then these studies may not take into account that those who are most susceptible may not fly at all due to the health risk.  Further, any studies about recirculated air quality on airplanes would not address the allergic reaction suffered by my nephew as a result of physical touch contact due to nut residue.  Last, any historical studies about recirculated air quality on airplanes certainly did not inhibit the issuance of rules prohibiting smoking by smoking passengers.
 
No doubt, some would say that the risk of a nut allergic individual sitting on a chair where a previous patron had wiped peanut butter is a risk that could occur in a variety of public forums.  This risk (among many related risks) resulted in my child's public school banning consumption of nuts.  Other places of pubic accommodations (such as several professional sports arenas) have provided my child with nut-free suites in an attempt to satisfy their obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA"").  Airplanes, of course, present a much more unique and much more serious health risk to nut allergic individuals due to the confined space, recirculated air, and time delay to receive adequate on-ground emergency medical care.  
 
I reside in Michigan, and Delta Airlines is the dominant air carrier providing air travel service at Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Delta Airlines affirmatively serves peanuts and tree nut products to passengers.  Because virtually all passengers will be consuming peanut and tree nut products - and passengers will be consuming them at the same time - the risks of an allergic reaction due to the airborne tree nut/peanut particles is significantly higher.  (Due to airborne peanut particles, my child once started to develop hives when standing near an individual consuming peanut butter in a store.)  While establishing a ""nut-free zone"" of a few rows near the nut allergic passenger (assuming airline personnel enforce it) might be considered some initial effort at addressing the situation - it is significantly inadequate action.  It does not address the airborne peanut/tree nut particles created from all other passengers consuming nut products at the same time and does not address the touch/residue allergic reaction my nephew suffered.  Further, the creation of ""smoke-free"" zones in years past was deemed inadequate to protect the health and safety of non-smoking passengers and aircraft personnel, and nowadays smoking is completely banned on commercial airlines.
 
There is, of course, no intrinsic or logical relationship between the consumption of nut products and traveling on an aircraft.  In other words, there is no logical or intrinsic or any other type of prerequisite that a passenger must consume nuts in order to travel on an aircraft.  
 
Crudely stated, the risk of an allergic reaction to peanuts and tree nuts is greater than other types of allergic reactions due to the residue and airborne nature of these products.  Peanut butter is sticky, and passengers (particularly children) can wipe the sticky substance from their hands onto other surfaces.  As my nephew's experience indicates, unless thoroughly sanitized, the sticky residue can remain, posing a danger to a nut allergic individual.  Unlike other allergens, the airborne nature of peanut/tree nut particles can cause an individual to react allergically.  A life-threatening allergic reaction is immediate (as opposed to a delayed health effect of a few hours or few days from other dietary restrictions).  In sum, the touch and airborne factors distinguish peanut/tree nut allergens from other allergens, and the immediate effectiveness of exposure (whether it be digestion, ingestion, smell, or touch) to the allergen causes an immediate effect (when immediate on-ground medical attention is impossible for an airborne passenger).
 
The progression of smoking on airplanes (and in restaurants) should be followed in the nut context.  In the past, all patrons were allowed to smoke, regardless of seat assignment.  Subsequently, no-smoking areas were designated for those passengers desiring to sit in smoke-free areas.  Subsequently, the no-smoking areas expanded to the extent that a smoking patron would have to affirmatively sit in a smoking section in order to smoke.  Despite this progression, there were no physical barriers for the smoke, and the smoke spewed into the non-smoking areas.  For the protection of non-smoking patrons and aircraft personnel, smoking patrons can no longer smoke on commercial airlines.  (Similarly several states now prohibit smoking by smoking patrons in restaurants/bars, and the trend appears to be that more will do so.)
 
No doubt the peanut industry, like the tobacco industry before it, will argue that prohibiting the consumption of its product on airplanes will negatively impact its industry.  In the smoking context, ultimately public policy and legal decisions championed health and safety factors over revenue to an industry.  Health and safety issues must win the day in the issue at hand as well.  The recognition of severe food allergies as a legal disability under the ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and Air Carrier Access Act show that not only are health and safety issues at play, but unlike the smoking context, civil rights issues are present.  Despite incurring some costs, the ADA requires business to make reasonable accommodations for those with disabilities.  (Further, the banning of smoking could simply be considered a loss to the tobacco industry without any gain to another industry.  By contrast, the peanut industry's loss could be another industry's gain - for example airlines could choose to serve raisins instead of nuts -- and hence the gain to the raisin industry could counteract the loss to the peanut industry.)  One ultimate goal of these statutes and corresponding public policy is to achieve inclusion and integration of disabled and protected individuals into mainstream society, despite businesses and industries incurring costs.  Health and safety risks should not continue to exist denying these individuals the ability to use public transportation.  


The only manner to do so in the situation at hand is to implement one of two alternatives:
 
(1) to ban the consumption of peanut and tree nut products on all commercial flights, or
 
(2) at the very least, to ban the consumption of peanut and tree nut products on the specific commercial flight the nut allergic individual intends to utilize (i.e. the air carrier would not serve peanut or tree nut products and make announcements at both the gate and on-board the aircraft that passengers can not consume any nut products which passengers themselves might otherwise provide), provided: 
 
(a) a nut allergic individual (or representative) has provided advanced notice to the air carrier (with a reasonably advance notice requirement of 72 hours, for example) of the individual's severe allergies and identification of the flight the individual desires to utilize, and 
 
(b) to address previous nut consumption on the aircraft,  the air carrier has thoroughly sanitized the seating area of the nut-allergic individual on the applicable airplane and the entire aircraft's air circulation system (consistent with any existing or to be developed federal guidelines),
 
(c) the air carrier keeps the identity of the nut allergic passenger confidential so as to protect the nut allergic individual from retribution from other passengers, and  
 
(d) to the extent same-day flight cancellations or delays occur and the nut-allergic individual must re-book a flight, then the 72 hour advanced notice (for example) would cease to apply and the nut allergic individual (or representative) would merely need to notify air carrier officials at the gate as soon as reasonably possible, and the sanitation requirement could be waived if compliance is not feasible given time constraints.   
 
 
Thank you again for raising this important health, safety, and disability civil rights issue.

Food can make our daughter incredibly sick or worse. And we've seen it happen. I never want to be stuck in an airplane while my daughter was having a severe reaction. There are plenty of other snack foods available that aren't as hard to control. Peanut residue can be airborne, and it can land all over the seats, floor, tables, etc. without even seeing it.

1. I fully support efforts to require airlines to post information about additional fees along with flight travel information so that we can know how much our travel will cost in advance.  We too have been caught off guard, dishing out hefty fees beyond what was expected on recent travel.

2. I request that you also require airlines to ensure that airline travelers have reasonable means to compete for seats for people with special needs.  My husband is tall and finds it extremely uncomfortable to fit in the current usual coach seat.  We do not think that someone should have to pay more for a seat to get extra leg room if there are real physical constraints.  He is not overweight, he is simply tall. It is genetic and as far as I can see, he should not be forced to pay more for a few more inches of legroom.  

3. As a corollary to the prior point, the airlines should provide a clear way or passengers to secure the few extra space leg room seats such as the bulkhead and exit row seats.  We have been told, “Call the night before”, “Arrive very early” (we do), “These seats are assigned at the gate—go to the gate” (we do), when we get there the seats are gone.  Clearly, some other “rules” (or lack thereof) are in play.  Then we observe that people who have no children and/or no special height challenges, are sitting in the seats.  Some airlines have made these seats “upgrades” requiring additional fees or bonus points—or maybe not….sometimes, people just get them.

4. The airlines need to provide equal or better seats or provide financial compensation when people are bumped out of their seat for whatever reason.  

On our most recent travels—a return flight, I purchase my tickets on-line, and obtained CONFIRMATION of seat assignment (three seats together—so my husband could stretch out his legs into our leg area and to be with our 5 year old son).   I bought the tickets with the understanding I had three seats together.  At some point, our flight was moved up two hours.  We were bumped out of our seats and no new assignments were made.  Our plane had the same seat configuration. When we called to confirm the night before, we discovered not only did we have no seat assignment, but the only seats available were all separate and all middle seats.  Again, I’m travelling with my 6’6” husband and a 5 YEAR OLD.   The airline was completely comfortable with bumping us out of our seats but was unwilling to do so to others when presented with our age and height issues.  Not that I expected or really wanted them to do this to another person, but it simply highlighted the hypocrisy and huge inequity of the situation.  After considerable haggling with the agent, I had to elevate the issue to a supervisor.  All very begrudgingly gave my husband an exit row seat.  (Highlighting the inequity mentioned in comment 2—there are “rules” for these seats except making a big issue out of it.)  We still had the issue of my 5 year old son, sitting with strangers.  This was unthinkable.  I could not monitor him, comfort him, supervise him and nor should the passengers on either side be required to assume this job.  I was flabbergasted that the airline was so heartless about this matter.  They know one person in our party was a five year old as it was noted on the reservation.   

This situation should never occur.  This is a bait and switch strategy.  On travel, there are few options.  You can’t just go next door.  You back us up against the wall while on travel.  I had a documented contract with the airline and they should stick to it or compensate.   This change had nothing to do with weather or other situations beyond their control.",,,,,,,

While I have survived thus far, it has been an uphill battle. I spend a great amount of time and money controlling my breathing and hives with medications.  Medications that will eventually affect my bones and other parts of my body.  I try to drive whenever I can in the safety of my automobile, but cannot all the time. Adults and children suffer from this.  I once had an allergic reaction on a plane and was not allowed to use my returning flight.ticket home.  Because there are no DOT regulations, it cost my family a great deal of money to get home.  Not to mention the humility of not being alllowed on the flight. What will this take to change such a simple thing as removing some peanut products,  a death of someone?  It will happen eventually!!  Peanut protein is so sticky that it sticks to surfaces and those who come in contact will touch this and have a reaction. Often it is a reaction of hives and then my breathing is labored.  If anyone has had hives, it is not pleasant.  It will be the small child who when her/his parents aren't looking will stick their fingers in their mouth and then what??  There are plenty of other hours in day that peanut companies can sell these products to those whom are not allergic to peanuts.  Of a 4 hour flight there are 20 more hours in a day these people can eat peanuts.  Just Please, remove them and let us enjoy our flights.",,,,,,,

We found out about a year ago that he is allergic to peanuts because his mom was getting  peanut butter out of the jar and let him lick some of the peanut butter. He really only touched his tongue to it and he broke out all over in big welts and hives.  He was tested and is definitely allergic to peanuts. His parents have to carry an Epi Pen with them where ever they go just in case he would get a reaction to  peanuts somewhere. He would still need rushed to the ER because the Epi Pen still may not save his life.  His mom was at a hospital waiting room for her best friend who was having a baby and she had him with her for awhile until we came and picked him up. It was a big open room with only the family of the lady having the baby waiting there. He came over to her and showed her something he had picked up off of the floor. It was a piece of a peanut  m & m !  Had he put it in his mouth it could have been a bad outcome that day.  Any environment that can be kept free of peanuts is one step toward keeping him safe for another few hours. People don't realize how severe the allergy can be and say well, you can't stop living because of one allergy.  It would be like passing out rat poison to customers and saying now be careful and try not to get any on your hands and don't  touch your mouth or your clothing or your luggage and don't let your children touch this either or they may die.    I never realized the severity of it either until I went with her to the doctor and heard him say to her and I that if he ate peanuts he could turn blue and stop breathing and he could die. It sort of hits you in the face.  So, anything the Department of Transportation could do to save a life today or in the future by not serving peanuts on flights and educating the public about peanut allergies would be a step toward making this world a better allergy friendly place. thank you",,,,,,,

She also has hay fever and eczema.  Her allergy is so severe that even being around the smell of peanut butter set off a severe reaction.  I know people like their peanuts mid flight, but the fact is they ""like"" peanuts,  well I LOVE MY CHILD and she can not be replaced and does not deserve to go through anything life threatening because someone can't wait until they are landed to get a bag of peanuts.  My guess is those people who want the peanuts on board would actually never buy peanuts once they landed anyway, it is a tradition that simply needs to change.  We need a food that is never life threatening to anyone on board.  I can't imagine if a pilot was allergic or a senator or a celebrity, that it would be an issue/case closed the peanuts would never board the plane with any of these ""special"" individuals.  Again MY CHILD IS A SPECIAL INDIVIDUAL and I want to keep her and everyone safe in flight.",,,,,,,

The FlyersRights Position
We sent Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood a long letter in support of the proposed rules.  In that letter, we made five initial points.  Those are:

1.    The first airline passenger protection regulation is working very well.  (Delays in the first months of implementation down from 563 to 7, compared to previous year's same three months).

2.    DOT's argument in the NPRM for extending those regulatory requirements to the U.S. international operations of foreign flag carriers is strong and persuasive.

3.    DOT must promptly require that all extra fees be disclosed up front, so that we can compare the true total costs of competing carriers' fares.

4.    DOT regulatory action to protect airline passengers is particularly important because Congress has prohibited by, statute state, and local governments from regulating in these areas.

5.    FlyersRights.org urges that DOT publish the final regulation based on this NPRM by year's end, with an effective date for full carrier compliance no more than 120 days later.",,,,,,,

I have comments on three of the proposed rules:
1.  The rules on tarmac delays should apply to all flights and be included in the contract of carriage.  From a paying passenger perspective, the inability to leave my seat and the hardships caused by sitting on the tarmac are no different based on the size or the national registration of the airplane.  It is known that planes push back from the gate in order to improve their ""on-time"" records, while passengers then suffer long delays.  It is gaming the system and I shouldn't have to pay for it with my time.
2.  I agree with all of the provisions on ticket oversales and bumping.  Airports are overcrowded and travel is unpleasant to stressful. The passenger is very vulnerable and disadvantaged at the time they are bumped. People are trying to catch flights so don't have the time to research regulations that might apply to them so defacto have to take what is offered to them. The passenger should have all of the information that the airline has, therefore there should be full disclosure of all options.
3.  Foreignt air carriers should have to comply with these rules.  With codeshares, passengers may not always know they are not flying on a US carrier.  Also, why would we hold U.S. carriers accountable and not the competitor airlines.  As a passenger, why should I be allowed to be treated differently just because I'm not on a U.S. carrier, but in a U.S. airport.

Thank you for your attention.",,,,,,,

The FlyersRights Position
We sent Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood a long letter in support of the proposed rules.  In that letter, we made five initial points.  Those are:

1.    The first airline passenger protection regulation is working very well.  (Delays in the first months of implementation down from 563 to 7, compared to previous year's same three months).

2.    DOT's argument in the NPRM for extending those regulatory requirements to the U.S. international operations of foreign flag carriers is strong and persuasive.

3.    DOT must promptly require that all extra fees be disclosed up front, so that we can compare the true total costs of competing carriers' fares.

4.    DOT regulatory action to protect airline passengers is particularly important because Congress has prohibited by, statute state, and local governments from regulating in these areas.

5.    FlyersRights.org urges that DOT publish the final regulation based on this NPRM by year's end, with an effective date for full carrier compliance no more than 120 days later.",,,,,,,

I understand that running an airline is tough business. However, the government has long recognized that it can’t let the airlines compete on things like aircraft maintenance, crew duty time, aircraft build standards, etc. It is an easy argument to make that flying does in fact cost more because of the aforementioned regulations. But the government rightly steps in and basically sets the lower limit to prevent individual airlines from driving the entire industry down to the lowest common denominator.

So in terms of airline operations, higher costs, because of necessary government regulation, has long been accepted.

Those of us that are insisting on a “passenger bill of rights” are simply asking for the same thing. Namely, that there are some standards that all airlines must adhere to. This shouldn’t be controversial. It isn’t any different than what has long been accepted for the operation of an airline. Yes there might be some incremental cost to doing this but I seriously doubt that it will be significant. 

You can already see how the airlines will end up without some passenger “dignity” standards. They have taken away our pillows, our blankets, and contemplated charges for bathroom use. All because some bean counter somewhere has computed the cost of carrying that “stuff” adds up to $1,000,000/year in fuel expense or some such. Well you know what, charge more for the ticket but don’t nickel and dime us to death. If I recall, that is the same formula used by Detroit before the Japanese taught them a hard lesson about passenger convenience.

And finally, there is no option to avoid airlines these days. If you need to travel from the east coast to the west coast and back in a week, then flying is about the only real choice you have.

Without strong regulations, airlines will continue to abuse passengers and deny them their rights.  We do not relinquish our rights when we purchase an airline ticket.

All advertisements, websites and any other ""outlets"" should be required to show ONLY this ""Typical Airfare"" bundled rate for each airline's fare so as to level the playing field and provide a straightforward means of comparison for the consumer.  The consumer should still be given the opportunity to choose which service beyond the base fare they wish to pay for and take advantage of.

So, as a result, the flying public is subjected to intrusive searches and frequent fear-inciting announcements about the ""color"" of the alert and to fear packages and unattended luggage.  

Put more emphasis into FBI and police investigation of terrorists and terror cells - INCLUDING those such as the White Ayrian Nation and similar organizations as well as those of Moslem terrorists, for they are equally dangerous and are, seemingly, being ignored.  

We have, as a Nation, given in to fear by a bunch of criminals, abrogated many freedoms and proceeded to create a closed society.  The terrorists have seemingly won.  It should not be this way.  We should have been able to rise above this insult and treat 9/11 as the criminal act it was and maintained our National composure and original freedoms.  These have been a sad nine years.",,,,,,,

Most airlines don't charge the fee in this age category, and given that i had, during booking, selected this age category and bought the ticket, it was certainly reasonable to believe that was the end of it. Instead, upon my ex's arrival at the airport, they informed her she would need to come up with $100 more before my son could board the flight. I read about this happening to someone else, but the person didn't have the money on them so their child missed the flight. In my case, this caused friction with my ex and how we have agreed to divide the cost of air travel for my son. Furthermore, because of the forced unaccompanied minor service, my son was not able to buy food during his entire 12 hr trip. Ultimately, this is a clear case of extortion. 
I paid $995 for a RT flight from Ottawa to Seattle, which went via Atlanta, when I could have flown him direct to Vancouver for $450. I have written to Delta, signed the online petition & am going to persist. THIS IS CRIMINAL EXTORTION. YOU NEED TO DO YOUR JOB TOO!",,,,,,,

Even if one does not ascribe to global warming, it is important not waste fuel in gross amounts.  Pilots have estimated that the cost of an incremental passenger mile (the cost per file for flying an additional passenger on a typically loaded plane) for a typical passenger is 0.05 gallons of jet fuel.  This means that if an airline routes someone across the country to take 2500 miles instead of 2000, an extra 25 gallons of fuel is being used.  If one multiplies this by millions of passengers, the results are significant.

Comment/Proposal: Since charging a change fee will discourage passengers from making routing changes, airlines should not be allowed to charge ANY change fees of any type to ticketed passengers who find a shorter route to their destination in the same class of service, even if any prior segments have been flown.

Such inconvenience fees are not driven by any sense of trying to create better service.  When this conflicts with national goals such as energy conservation on a gross scale, it should be prohibited.  This will also provide incentive to provide proper automated systems to handle such changes.",,,,,,,

He is sensitive to contact, ingestion, and airborne exposure to peanuts and nuts.

His airborne reaction occurred while passing a nut vendor in a stroller. He woke up gasping for breath and dry heaving.  Subsequent skin and blood tests confirmed that he is allergic to nuts and peanuts. 

It is important to consider that people  do not know that they are sensitive to airborne exposure until it happens. An enclosed space with a lot of nuts is a high risk environment for all types of exposures, especially airborne, if a lot of nut packets are opened.

The following has worked for us. My son has safely traveled on airlines that do the following:
1) never serve peanuts
2) and refrain from serving tree nuts during his flight
3) and announce that passengers refrain from eating nuts during the flight in consideration of a passenger on board who is severely allergic to nuts.

The safest thing to do is to ban peanuts and nuts,  as well as inform the passengers that there is someone on the flight who is allergic to peanuts/nuts. And develop a medically sanctioned statement that briefly explains airborne exposure to nuts to discourage other passengers from eating any they brought with them. 

The only other reasonable alternative for an airborne sensitive passenger is for the airlines to refrain from serving nuts on flights when requested to by a passenger with nut allergies. This should be supported with the announcement noted above about airborne exposure.

Minimizing quantity of nuts, if not eliminating nuts, is essential to provide reasonably safe travel for nut allergic passengers. Airlines can minimize risk this way and inform allergic person of efforts so there is no expectation for absolutely nut free environment.

The airlines are responsible for providing a safe trip, not for providing someone's preference for a package of nuts.",,,,,,,

Dear DOT,
First, let me say that it is not your business to limit my comment length and I think you all need to fix this problem.  Second, I've attached the rest of my comments.  DOT works for us, the people.  It's not your business to censor comments so please change your submittal forms.

All I can say is “about time!”  Things in the airline industry have been out of control since the 1970’s, with de-regulation and its aftermaths.  If we continue to look on the industry as a private industry rather than as a strategic asset to our nation, then things will continue on this path to disintegration.
The airline industry uses public airspaces to conduct its private, profit-making business.  They don’t pay, as far as I know, for that privileged use of public airspace.  They should start to be held accountable for this use.  A use, I may add, that environmentally degrades our airspaces.  I believe that it is also time to do a National Environmental Policy Act review of how the airline industry is cumulatively affecting our airspace, and therefore could also be affecting our climates.
It is time to re-regulate the airline industry—and, re-regulation does not mean non-profit.  It means that the airline industry will earn money, but not excessively, to run and maintain its planes, pay its salaries, and maybe have something left over for their stockholders. Not the other way around where the stockholders come first and the paying public comes last.  There are major issues in the airline industry and they must be addressed at the national level.  The time has come to consider whether we cannot afford to have thousands of fuel-guzzling fuselages circling our planet and come up with a better, cleaner mode of transportation.  Bullet trains anyone???  It is time to re-allocate transportation funding toward clean train travel",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2010-0140-1696/attachment_1.doc",

Sometimes it is the case that one cannot reasonably book an entire trip on one ticket stock.  For example, my brother in SLC purchased a round trip ticket for himself, his son, and our father to Europe on Delta and one of its partners.  However, since my father was in PDX, my brother had to buy a separate round trip ticket from PDX to arrive a few hours prior to the SLC departure.  I confirmed with Delta that if my father did not make the flight in SLC, whatever the reason - including through fault of Delta - that my brother would be out the money for my father's Europe flight (along with needing to buy a new ticket).  Does that seem proper?

Proposed rule:  When all segments on two or more tickets are with a given airlines or partner airlines to the airlines on the ticket, then if a passenger cannot make a connecting flight because of prior flight delays, the airlines will undertake to transport that person and their luggage to their destination as soon as practicable (including providing overnight lodging if a next day flight is necessary).


Discussion: The common objection cited to such type of 'linked' tickets is that one transportation company really can't be responsible for another one.  However, when they are partners, and even more so if it is the same airline, this argument does not hold.  Is it really reasonable for an airline to not transport someone (without repaying for the ticket at a hefty price) on the second half of their trip if it was missed due to a problem with same airline on the first half?",,,,,,,

• Nearly two-thirds (65%) said such fees placed some or a great deal of unexpected financial strain on their budget for the trip, while more than a quarter (26%) said that those fees placed a great deal of unexpected strain.

• A nearly unanimous 99% of respondents said that they think airlines should be required to disclose all of their fees in advance on every web site that sells airline tickets.

• When asked to rank the fees they found most annoying, respondents rated carry-on baggage fees the most annoying, with 91% calling those fees “very annoying,” followed by seat reservation fees (88% very annoying), checked baggage fees (74%), and telephone reservation fees (67%).",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2010-0140-1710/attachment_1.pdf",

1. General

From a legal point of view and speaking generally, we are fundamentally concerned about the NPRM.  It does not seem to be technically fully mature.  It appears that the international dimension of the originally intended purpose to enhance passenger rights within the US was not sufficiently assessed beforehand and therefore not sufficiently addressed in the proposal.  In particular, the proposal does not always adequately describe the envisaged geographical scope of application.  However, this leads to uncertainty in an international business such as aviation – this is in particular a lesson learnt from the EU Commission’s consumer protection endeavours in Europe concerning Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004.

It should be clear from the outset that exterritorial application of the NPRM would conflict and interfere with international and EU law as well as the national laws of any EU Member State which we deem not acceptable.  The NPRM therefore should only be interpreted in a way that it does not have exterritorial effects. 

Furthermore, it should be noted that EU carriers, such as Air Berlin, are already subject to stringent EU passenger rights regulations and therefore the proposal does not only create new (additional) burdens to operate routes to/ from the US, but it also contains conflicts with EU law and thereby creates a risk for confusion and legal uncertainty.

The NPRM is subject to international law.  The three most important and fundamental legal texts in the area of aviation in this context are the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage (Montreal Convention) and the EU-US Air Transport Agreement.  The NPRM may take effect only within the scope and limitations set out in these regulations.

This makes sense because it reduces cost.  However, some airlines have realized that they can make money by charging customers to do what they could not accomplish on the internet.  Therefore, in the interest of the flying populace and the long term interest of the airlines moving to a completely automated system, I propose:

Suggested rule:  In order to encourage airlines to be more efficient and complete the internet automation that they have begun, airlines should not charge any fees on flights that can not be booked via the internet, or that require customer interaction.  Some examples are international award flights or problems with the flight.

Discussion: This is a great win for everyone.  Airlines are thus encouraged to have a highly professional system which customers will be pleased to use, and glitches will be ironed out quickly.  The test is simple: if the booking or issue can be resolved through the internet, then there was no need for the customer interaction and hence a fee may be charged at the airline's discretion.  On the other hand, if the customer has no other recourse but to call the airline company about a given issue (whether it be to book a ticket, arrange an alternate routing, etc), then it seems improper to require a separate payment for that, especially as it encourages the airline not to fix the problem.",,,,,,,

I wish to fully support the proposed rule, especially with regard to fair and conspicuous upfront disclosure of fees, both optional and mandatory, associated with air travel.  Advertisement of airfares without the add-ons of taxes, gate fees, luggage fees, and so forth is a deceptive practice, more so when there exists a fee for the change or cancellation of reservations.  Compounding this usury with the standard practice of overbooking flights creates an environment in which the consumer is not merely helpless, but also potentially stranded far from his/her destination.

It is my considered opinion that the rule should be adopted AS PROPOSED, and enacted with all due haste.

Yours truly,
Dr. Michael Reed",,,,,,,

1.    The first airline passenger protection regulation is working very well.  (Delays in the first months of implementation down from 563 to 7, compared to previous year's same three months).

2.    DOT's argument in the NPRM for extending those regulatory requirements to the U.S. international operations of foreign flag carriers is strong and persuasive.

3.    DOT must promptly require that all extra fees be disclosed up front, so that we can compare the true total costs of competing carriers' fares.

4.    DOT regulatory action to protect airline passengers is particularly important because Congress has prohibited by, statute state, and local governments from regulating in these areas.

5.    FlyersRights.org urges that DOT publish the final regulation based on this NPRM by year's end, with an effective date for full carrier compliance no more than 120 days later.",,,,,,,

My first choice would be that nut products were banned on airlines altogether since there are so many other easy to serve options that don't run the risk of death for others.  


If a total ban isn't possible, then at the very very least, I would love a regulation in place that requires airlines to make accommodations for people with this health disability.

I would like this law to state that airlines not serve nut products on flights as requested by a consumer at the time of ticket reservation and/or purchase.  This requirement needs to be in place regardless of where and how they purchase the ticket, e-ticket or make a reservation.  Written confirmatin should be given to the passenger at time of purchase via email or other venue so the airline has acknowledged their responsibility and the consumer can travel with peace of mind from place to place without fear or surprise.

   In addition, airline employees should be made to announce this to other passengers prior to boarding so they have a chance to purchase and bring on alternate snacks.   Flight attendants should have the authority to enforce this in-flight ban too.

People often think that  the epi-pens we carry are the answer but what they don’t know is from the beginning of a reaction, you have only seven minutes before an allergic person could die.   Also, even after an injection, many people require a second one and should be on their way to a hospital after the first.   

When one stops to consider this, is a 1 oz bag of nuts on a plane really that important?   Thanks for  stepping in this family's shoes for a few moments!",,,,,,,

The FlyersRights Position
We sent Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood a long letter in support of the proposed rules.  In that letter, we made five initial points.  Those are:

1.    The first airline passenger protection regulation is working very well.  (Delays in the first months of implementation down from 563 to 7, compared to previous year's same three months).
2.    DOT's argument in the NPRM for extending those regulatory requirements to the U.S. international operations of foreign flag carriers is strong and persuasive.
3.    DOT must promptly require that all extra fees be disclosed up front, so that we can compare the true total costs of competing carriers' fares.
4.    DOT regulatory action to protect airline passengers is particularly important because Congress has prohibited by, statute state, and local governments from regulating in these areas.
5.    FlyersRights.org urges that DOT publish the final regulation based on this NPRM by year's end, with an effective date for full carrier compliance no more than 120 days later.",,,,,,,

For short travel it's generally something small, for travel over 1000 miles, that often include a change of clothes and overnight accomodations.  

All airlines should allow one (1) checked bag for free for short flights.  This reduces the amount of overhead storage.  Reduces security lines.  It reduces loading and off-loading time and expedites turn-over time to re-loading a plane.  For flights that are international, two (2) checked bags NEED to be allowed.  Longer travel, more clothes and toiletries needed.

Gate attendants should check more on the size of carry-on luggage at front check-in before sercurity.  Enforcing the size at this point can reduce large bags from taking up space in the cabin.  Also doing this, the airline can make-up for it's reduced income by allowing checked bags.  

Airlines should allow exceptions to extra bags for some individuals moving ie: students moving to/from a college.  An official college acceptance letter with class start date.  (One extra free bag).  By encouraging checking bag, it allows for faster boarding.

For flights less than 2 hours, really only need minimal drink services.  For flights over 2 hours but less than 5 beverage service (that most offer now) and a small snack.  After five hours, the airlines need to provide a small meal.  You can't expect people to skip a meal.  Allow individuals to upgrade to better meal services or purchase snacks in addition.  Need to provide drink due to dry air.

For overnight flights, offer pillow and blanket, besides that most people don't ""need"" those services.  Have a few available for elderly, youth or those with medical issues.  

If American's are getting fatter, why remove legroom?  People need to be able to move around and they can't when you reduce the legroom and they are already barely fit.  

When someone travels, certain ""comforts"" need to be provided.  Freedom to move, ability to get refreshments, ability to relax.",,,,,,,

     I am a member of Flyersrights.org.  I do fully support the comprehensive and thoughtful remarks submitted by our nonprofit organization regarding DOT-OST-2010-0140-1080, Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections.  I strongly urge you to implement the proposed Rulemaking with all of the needed Flyersrights.org suggested improvements as soon as possible.  

     Thank you for your assistance to the millions of U.S. airline passengers that do not wish to be treated like a commodity.
As one who is a frequent flier and a potential victim of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), e.g., on SFO-Boston RT flights where I have competed in 16 consecutive Boston Marathons, I trust you will continue to work diligently on behalf of us consumers.

We asked our allergy support group when the best time to fly was that did not serve nuts and were advised to fly first thing in the AM.  We booked our flights accordingly and notified the airline of my son’s anaphylaxis to nuts ahead of time via recorded phone conversations.  The airline advised us upon check in to notify the attendants of my son’s allergies and ask nuts not be served.  Upon check in we did as advised and received attitude from the attendant and pilot who appeared uneducated on anaphylactic reactions.  The pilot felt the ‘barrier option’ was suitable and sent over a “grounds crew person” who parked planes to tell us.  Needless to say we were very distraught as when bags of nuts are opened they often fly everywhere.  We almost didn’t fly in fear of the safety of my son but we needed to work the next day.  Unfortunately my son had to listen to all the discussions and I had to reassure him as a parent that we took all the necessary precautions and had Epipens/Benadryl with us and if there was a problem the pilot would land the plane!  The scariest part was going to the bathroom beyond the barrier and having to pick him up so he did not step on the nuts dropped in the aisle.  The barrier option of a one row buffer around a peanut/tree nut individual is alienating and really not a safe solution as the nuts end up on their shoes and children pick up and touch their shoes while sitting and can have a reaction.  In a confined space thousands of miles up in the air serving nuts is unacceptable and cheats allergy individuals of being able to fly and travel.  The better solution would be to not serve any peanuts or tree nuts.  This experience was unsafe and I do not know if we will ever fly again which is extremely sad as a parent of a 5 year old who wants their child to have a normal life and be safe!",,,,,,,

The five main points are:

1.    The first airline passenger protection regulation is working very well.  (Delays in the first months of implementation down from 563 to 7, compared to previous year's same three months).
2.    DOT's argument in the NPRM for extending those regulatory requirements to the U.S. international operations of foreign flag carriers is strong and persuasive.
3.    DOT must promptly require that all extra fees be disclosed up front, so that we can compare the true total costs of competing carriers' fares.
4.    DOT regulatory action to protect airline passengers is particularly important because Congress has prohibited by, statute state, and local governments from regulating in these areas.
5.    FlyersRights.org urges that DOT publish the final regulation based on this NPRM by year's end, with an effective date for full carrier compliance no more than 120 days later.

Thank you for your consideration,

Respectfully submitted,

The airline industry often indicates that enacting rules to protect passengers will in the end be deleterious to an important global industry.  In fact, the facts are quite different. It is very important to maintain a modicum of decency in the way passengers are treated, or we will not fly.  In our recent international flight, my 22 year old son indicated: ""Who needs to put up with this, from now on, I am staying home"".  Although I fly for business often, more and more of my meetings are over the computer, as I also am exhausted of being treated in a way in which I would not treat my dog.
You, as the government agent, have the power and the duty to support and protect the public. I truly hope that you live up to this ideal, and protect the longevity and well-being of our airline industry in the process.  Yes, two rights do make a larger right!

This, however, costs the government money, because persons away from home tend to spend more money.  By permitting these fees, the US government is (and local governments are) denying itself (themselves) revenue!  What could be the possible incentive for the government to allow this?


Proposed rule:  A ticketed passenger may always lengthen the duration of their stay on a round trip or open jaw ticket at no cost (ie. no change/handling/rebooking/etc fee), provided the same or a shorter routing is used, in the same class of service.  Standby may also be used provided the trip is an extension and in the same class of service and the routing is no longer than the original.


Discussion: This rule would encourage longer trips and increased spending, hence increased tax revenue, especially since a stay extension is generally indicative of a positive spirit.  Companies should not undertake practices where there is no operational benefit, but which at the same time discourage business or commerce.",,,,,,,

There are 5 points I would like to stress.

1.    The first airline passenger protection regulation is working very well.  (Delays in the first months of implementation down from 563 to 7, compared to previous year's same three months).

2.    DOT's argument in the NPRM for extending those regulatory requirements to the U.S. international operations of foreign flag carriers is strong and persuasive.

3.    DOT must promptly require that all extra fees be disclosed up front, so that we can compare the true total costs of competing carriers' fares.

4.    DOT regulatory action to protect airline passengers is particularly important because Congress has prohibited by, statute state, and local governments from regulating in these areas.

5.    FlyersRights.org urges that DOT publish the final regulation based on this NPRM by year's end, with an effective date for full carrier compliance no more than 120 days later.",,,,,,,

On July 26, 2010, I was booked on Spirit Airlines flight NK 403, MYR-ATL-FLL; I was to board at ATL. The 6:50 PM departure time was postponed to 7:59, thern to 8:42, 9:42, 10:42 and then shortly before 9 PM the flight was cancelled. Passengers were offered rebooking TWO DAYS LATER, and then sent e mail rebooking notices for NK 403 for July 28. No amenities of any kind were offered. The excuse given was weather because there had been a severe storm at and around MYR which - as I later determined- reached its height between 6:30 and 7:00, had abated by 8:00 and was gone by 9:00. The aircraft could have safely departed MYR, albeit several hours late. Many passengersmissed their connections to international destinations. One young woman who lives in South Florida was stranded with her small child. Not a shred of empathy or helpfulness was shown. I flew home (I  live in Miami Beach) on July 27 on Delta. I am currently suing Spirit for damages and violation of contract, and have ordered production of internal communications regarding this incident. DOT needs to maintain weather records, correlate them with weather-excused cancellations to expose false ones, and require at least minimal help to stranded passengers if a weather excuse is in fact bonafide. I stress that storms are finite. They have a beginning and an end. Even if that storm had raged for six hours and the flight had been eight hours late, that would have been far preferable to the stranded passengers than a two-day delay.",,,,,,,

I spent over 6 hours on a Newark NJ tarmac 15 years ago and nothing has changed in all these years.  My flight was 5.5 hours.  Screaming kids, dogs in the hold who's meds had warn off. Crying dog owners and Nazi like flight attendances who wouldn't let us use the bathroom, stand up or move.  In 15 years nothing has changed we need intense regulations for this industry to put customers first and for common concerns to be addressed.

I've sat on the tarmac for hours, wasted my time, suffered with no explanations or apologies....I finally came to my senses and said THAT'S IT.  I'M DONE.  No more travelling for me - EVER.  If I need to go to another city, I'll take a car, bus, or train.  I will not set one foot on another airplane until the entire industry gets its head out of its collective behind and shapes up.  No other industry could get away with treating customers SO poorly and being SO mismanaged and incompitent....how come Americans let the airlines get away with such embarassing disorganization? Well not me, that's for sure.  If the airlines ever want me to spend my hard-earned money on their product, they'd darn well better make some drastic changes!  There, that's my two cents.

The FlyersRights Position

We sent Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood a long letter in support of the proposed rules.  In that letter, we made five initial points.  Those are:

1.    The first airline passenger protection regulation is working very well.  (Delays in the first months of implementation down from 563 to 7, compared to previous year's same three months).

2.    DOT's argument in the NPRM for extending those regulatory requirements to the U.S. international operations of foreign flag carriers is strong and persuasive.

3.    DOT must promptly require that all extra fees be disclosed up front, so that we can compare the true total costs of competing carriers' fares.

4.    DOT regulatory action to protect airline passengers is particularly important because Congress has prohibited by, statute state, and local governments from regulating in these areas.

5.    FlyersRights.org urges that DOT publish the final regulation based on this NPRM by year's end, with an effective date for full carrier compliance no more than 120 days later.",,,,,,,

My last passage was on an air carrier that charged $8 each way to pre-assign a seat! That was an extra $90 for our family of five! Yes, I could have not pre-assigned our seats but is that asking too much to want to sit with your own family? You know for a fact thay could not have assigned our seats together on the day of the flight. So we were stuck.

 The thought of a foreign carriier legally keeping us captive on the tarmac is frightening. I have experienced a 10 hour tarmac delay with a 1 yr old toddler and a newborn baby. We ran out of diapers and baby formula. It was a nightmare! We are people with needs and rights...not animals! I urge you to pass this document!

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Airlines should either:

(2) can serve peanuts if they actively ask all passengers about peanut allergy at time of booking, post info signs at airport counters/gates, and for flights with peanut allergies, must fully vacuum seats/floor and check seat pockets.

To reduce chance of passengers bringing peanuts onboard, ban the sale or use of peanut-containing products in airports; however, allow airport restaurants to use peanut oil.  Add unsealed peanuts to the liquids list for the 1 quart bag at security.

Airlines should carry epinephrine injectors just like defibrillators since this can be life-threatening and the passenger might not I have it or unaware of peanut allergy.

Give flight attendants specific authority to ask passengers to put peanuts away.  If a passenger refuses and results in an emergency landing, the non-cooperative passenger must be cited or detained for disobeying instructions.",,,,,,,

    Pricing:  Airlines should be required to advertise the total price a passenger will have to pay for carriage--including all fees, taxes, luggage charges, fees for seat selection, and other charges.  The small print can be used, if an airline wishes, to break out taxes, etc.  This is opposite to the way many airlines now advertise on their webpages and elsewhere.  ""One way"" fares must apply to fares that can be purchased for one-way travel.  If it's half of a round trip fare, airlines should be required to say it's the fare ""each way.""
     Tarmac waits:  Airlines should be permitted, once an aircraft door has been closed, to keep the passengers on board for a maximum of two hours before permitting them to disembark.  But no airline should be permitted to require passengers to stay on board even for a lesser time if (1) no water is available; or (2) if insufficient restroom facilities are available; or (3) if temperatures exceed 80 degrees or drop below 60 degrees.",,,,,,,

Routes are advertised at certain award levels, but when one goes to find them they are not available, usually because only a few were made available.  But it is worse at the partner level, because the releases of frequent flyer tickets are not coordinated.  Thus, if one wants to set up an international ticket on certain routes, it can be exceptionally difficult because only one portion of the route is released, and perhaps only an awkward routing is available on the other portion.  So if one wants to be assured of a ticket at all, one is obliged to take the awkward routing.  And this might be OK if it was possible to switch to a better routing on its release, but it won't happen with fees being charged to change anything.

Proposal:  Airlines together with their frequent flyer partners should be required to release tickets in a uniform way to enable their customers an equal opportunity to avail themselves of tickets.  Or not impose a change fee for frequent flier tickets changes.  Or both.


Discussion: The biggest argument against this, that these are private programs between the airlines and their customers, might have some validity if the programs had healthy differences.  But the programs are almost all copycats of one another, which in the best case means that there is minimal competition, and that there is a need for consumer protection.  Inconvenience fees are akin to parking tickets - when they are there not to deter people from parking incorrectly, but rather in the hopes that people do park incorrectly, one should revisit the underlying justifications and assumptions.",,,,,,,

Market forces have not had the effect of maintaining airline passengers safety during unscheduled waits on the tarmac at airports. People who are forced to sit for more than three hours at a time in the same place are at much greater risk for developing a painful medical condition called deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot that occurs in the lower legs. This condition requires expensive treatment with a blood thinner for which there is no generic form for six months and wearing expensive support stockings for the rest of the effected person's life. Parking a plane for more than three hours and then adding flight time puts the whole contingent of passengers at risk for these expensive medical treatments. It may save the airline money to treat it's passengers badly, but in the end it costs the passengers more money.

Therefore, I request that the Department extend the passenger protections that require the airlines to allow them to deplane if a wait on the tarmac will last for more than three hours. Airline passengers need the protection of the government, the market will not solve this problem.",,,,,,,

If someone tells me that an item is $300, I expect to pay around $300, and not $500.  And yet, this can easily happen with airline tickets these days.

Suggestion / Proposed rule: Quotes for tickets, whether published in print media, online, or over the phone should reflect the cost that the typical customer will pay for the trip, including fees (processing, baggage, convenience, or otherwise), taxes, surcharges, and anything else that the passenger would expect to pay that is directly related to the air portion of the trip.

Discussion: It is a reasonable expectation on the part of consumers to be told prices up front, and that the prices quoted should be the amount a typical passenger expects to pay.  In the past, I would have said will pay, but since airlines are imposing after the fact inconvenience charges, they are actually not collecting the money for the entire trip at the time you purchase the ticket.  Nevertheless, baggage and other fees are part of the ticket.  Therefore, the price quoted should be the greater of what the ""average person"" pays (for a given class of service) and what the average of the largest minority (eg. coach class with one bag) of people pays for their trip.  In any case, if most people pay for a single bag, or most people are paying to change their ticket, then that should be included in the quoted price.

Without something similar, it becomes increasingly difficult to compare airlines.  The point is that there should be some uniformity of information contained in price quotes.  Deceptive advertisement is not in the consumer's best interest.  It also does not reflect well on any agency that allows it.",,,,,,,

An airline recently did this to me while I was declining their extras, entering my credit card and Secure Flight info (which took less than 5 minutes).  If there is a time limit, they need to inform you of it, and they need to honor the quoted fare during that interval, which should be at least 15-20 minutes.
There should be legal standards for carry-on luggage - for example, rollaboards up to 22"" should be accepted as carry on.  If the airlines overhead bins can only accommodate 20"" rollaboards, they should the 22"" bags for free  If your carry on gets bumped, they should be required to GATE CHECK it - not send it to the baggage carousel.  I usually travel with carry-on only to save time and to reduce risk of theft.  I should not have to have my bag bumped to the carousel because other people bring too much stuff or won't put their backpacks under the seat in front of them.
Can the airlines be required to allow a checked bag OR a carry on (but not both) for free?  This might help free up overhead bin space.
Is there any talk of the rights of passengers who are forced to sit next to obese passengers who encroach on their seat space?  I once found myself in this situation and was offered only ""a free drink to fall asleep."" It was a 5.5 hour flight.  Also, rules should be more firmly established that allow airlines to deny boarding to such people if they can't/won't buy a second seat.  Obesity of that extreme is a result of lifestyle choices, and can be a severe discomfort, if not an outright safety hazard, to other people.",,,,,,,

Of note, 234 respondents reported allergic reactions on airplanes, ranging from mild to serious.

The potential seriousness of allergic reactions and the increased number of people affected by food allergies (the CDC reported that food allergies increased 18% among children in a 10-year time span), are compelling reasons to create policies that accommodate food allergic passengers.  Our hope is that policymakers and the airline industry will address this serious health issue in a comparable manner in which they addressed health issues aggravated by second-hand smoke on airplanes.

We are willing to offer our services to assist agency officials and the airline industry in further study regarding the risks of flying with food allergies, and hope that the survey AFAA conducted will serve as stepping stone to additional research.

Comment on:

Docket No. DOT-OST-2010-0140
RIN No. 2105-AD92
Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections

     Andrew Kalick respectfully contends that DOT's proposed rulemaking addresses long overdue issues. Mr.Kalick feels that tarmac delays and all other matters proposed by DOT and their associated provisions should be included in the contract of carriage. He also approves of the Business Traveler's Coalition comments in their entirety. His comments under this docket number and RIN more urgently address the Choice of Forum and Denied Boarding Rules. Related to these two subject areas, Kalick, first and foremost, believes that DOT lacks authority to regulate (propose rules/enforce current ones) that meddle in individual contractual affairs, the ambit of which denied boarding falls (already in the contract of carriage.) Further, increasing denied boarding compensation rates is hardly an action that will significantly, if at all, address the burden increasing involuntary denied boardings impose on passengers. The denied boarding compensation is based on the percentage of remaining flight coupons, a fact often ommitted from pundit comments. The airlines simply do not bump lower fare tickets. These lower fare tickets that passengers purchase are often if not exclusively the targets of denied boarding. Not only are they the overwhelming targets, airlines bump these passengers with complete disregard for the passengers and with relative impunity. Current and proposed amendments to the regulations at hand are in place and enforced without sole/preemptive authority.

Group fares are often not purchased immediately, but held with a deposit of $40-$100 per seat. Within 60, sometimes 90 days of travel, deposits are non-refundable.

Most airlines guarantee a base fare and do not guarantee taxes and ""fees."" So, on the purchase date, the tickets would be purchased at the guaranteed base fare plus current taxes and fees. Sounds fair enough. Taxes are understandable, they are well advertised, easy enough to calculate and if they are going to increase, are openly discussed and implemented on a set date. 

Airline fees, however, while apparently allowed, are not regulated by the government. They are not openly discussed, disclosed, advertised, or explained. They are often imposed without warning and in what truly could be an arbitrary fashion.  

Even when they disclosed it is next to impossible to find them. They are not printed on the contract. There is no place on the website to look up what particular fees are for a group quote.

The truly unfair part is that they can be increased at any time, again without warning, discussion or justification. Without openness and/or regulation the airlines can easily take advantage of consumers. One of the most insidious fees is the fuel surcharge. Airlines love to play ""bait and switch"" with that sneaky fee.

Of course, when the price goes up a consumer could choose not to buy the ticket and probably have to cancel their travel plans. And if the increase goes into effect within the non-refundable period, they also lose their deposit. That stinks for the consumers, but it's nice little profit for the airline for doing nothing.

Just one example of this happened to two of my groups in June. The airline's YQ fee (fuel surcharge) was increased $90 per seat about 45 days prior to departure. Too late to get the deposit back. That's $3420 lost.",,,,,,,

We sent Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood a long letter in support of the proposed rules.  In that letter, we made five initial points.  Those are:

1.    The first airline passenger protection regulation is working very well.  (Delays in the first months of implementation down from 563 to 7, compared to previous year's same three months).

2.    DOT's argument in the NPRM for extending those regulatory requirements to the U.S. international operations of foreign flag carriers is strong and persuasive.

3.    DOT must promptly require that all extra fees be disclosed up front, so that we can compare the true total costs of competing carriers' fares.

4.    DOT regulatory action to protect airline passengers is particularly important because Congress has prohibited by, statute state, and local governments from regulating in these areas.

5.    FlyersRights.org urges that DOT publish the final regulation based on this NPRM by year's end, with an effective date for full carrier compliance no more than 120 days later.",,,,,,,

Nuts may seem harmless but for certain passengers, they can be life-threatening.  My preference would be for DOT to ban nuts completely from airplanes but the next best position would be to prohibit them on flights if a passenger requests it.  The two-row ""buffer"" zone is useless if a passenger has an airborne allergy to nuts -- this decision would be tatamount to no change in the rules at all.

Before we knew of his allergy he did have a violent vomiting episode on a plane. In hindsight, that may have been due to the airborne nuts. Thankfully nothing more happened at that time since we were yet to be diagnosed and carry an epi pen. The next exposure required a race to the hospital!!

If I knew the planes were thoroughly cleaned between flights I would be comfortable with a peanut free flight, which I believe is option two. I would just ask that you not serve them and ask passengers to refrain from opening anything that might ""go"" airborne.

Thank you. My family is planning a Boston to LA flight next year and we will not travel an airline that won't help us keep our son safe.

I strongly urge you to consider revising regulations for airline transportation, specifically regarding the serving of peanuts and other allergy-related snacks.  I suggest that, if somebody on a flight is allergic and has notified the airlines, then it should be mandatory for the airline personnel to refrain from serving such snacks.  
As a person who has the most severe form of food allergies, anaphylaxis, I understand the frustration and uncertainty that individuals with food allergies face when using air transportation.  According to the Food Allergy and anaphylaxis website, a food allergy may be considered a disability under federal laws, such as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  
I strongly urge you to consider these changes.  
Thank you.

Travelers on both domestic and foreign airlines have a right not to be injured aboard a commercial aircraft.  Long tarmac delays during which food, water, and air conditioning are not provided not only cause tremendous stress to passengers but the potential for serious health consequences.  Older fliers and infants are particularly vulnerable.  The attitude of the airlines is nothing short of criminal.  But backed by the DOT, they know they can put passengers through any amount of suffering without consequence.  I totally support the Flyers Rights Organization and their efforts to provide the treatment to passengers which should be a given.

Please read this letter and understand it is a matter of life and death.
Kate,

  I just received your email regarding the danger of seat pitch, which caused me
to have MAJOR problems with LEG CRAMPS on DELTA flight #234 from Detroit to
Amsterdam on September 4, 2010.


  The seat was positioned too high, with less leg room in front of me, which
caused my left thigh to cramp. The pain was terrible, so clearly I started to
get up on the plane several times and to drink more water. I went to my bag and
took two aspirin to hopefully alleviate Deep Vein Thrombosis. One stewardess was
wonderful, offered help, offered water, and told me to get up if I needed to
alleviate the problem. Another stewardess told me I had to go back to my seat
even though there had been no obvious turbulence for more than 30 minutes. The
airplane was either an A330 or 340. When I flew from Amsterdam to Kiev on a KLM
737, there was enough leg room to stretch out and to be more comfortable. What a
difference. I feel like a sardine on long flights.


  Respectfully yours, Joe Travis, Binghamton, NY

DOT-OST-2010-0140-1787.1

     Andrew Kalick contends that Delta's comment in its entirety is fatally flawed. Delta's overall tone is entirely contemptuous of valid and sound proposed regulations designed to enhance passenger protections. In its introduction, Delta purports to already engage in exhaustive efforts of nearly all regulations proposed. If this were the case, Delta would not oppose nearly all proposals.
     Delta is among almost every other airline that have entered into consent orders dealing with their denied boarding practices, most within the past two years. These orders show that the current(denied boarding) regulations have not been followed, even after prior enforcement action has been levied.
     These consent orders show consistently that airlines, including Delta, simply hide any reference to denied boarding, fail to solicit volunteers, etc. The end result, at the behest of airlines concerned, is failing to provide transportation to confirmed paying passengers, without any payment at all, total disregard to their customers, and at great ancillary cost to such passengers.
     Contrary to Delta's claim, DOT never suggested such denied boarding a ""windfall"" or to provide the maximum payout to a customer. In fact, DOT, in a recent consent order explained that denied boarding is merely a payout for the inconvenience of a passenger, and it is a separate right.
     Delta shows no evidence that it adorns a policy that carries out current DOT regulations regarding denied boarding, nor does it show any evidence of how DOT's proposed regulations regarding ""denied boarding"" should not be enacted.
     Passengers properly presenting themselves for travel on a confirmed flight expect to travel on that particular flight, absent any lawful nuances. Airlines know who they will bump. Delta assumes implies (certain) passengers do, when in fact no one knows. Ban Overbooking",,,,,,,

3) Pre-boarding to give the seat a personal cleaning.
4) Message to other passengers, stating that an allergic person is on board, and to be mindful of that.

Thank you for writing on behalf of Ms. XXXXX Brown and yourself 
regarding the service provided while traveling with us on Delta Flight 
1864 from Minneapolis to District of Columbia Airport on 04 August 2010.
On behalf of everyone at Delta Air Lines, I sincerely apologize for the 
inconvenience, frustration, and concern of our failure to properly 
implement our onboard peanut service policy for your daughter who has a 
severe allergy to peanuts.

I am truly sorry that our flight attendants failed to make an 
announcement indicating that a passenger in Row 20 had a peanut allergy 
and that peanuts would not be served to Rows 17 to 23.  It is equally 
daunting to learn that our flight attendants failed to refrain from 
serving peanuts to the rows in front of your and offered you peanuts….

I have taken a moment to carefully review your communication and your 
daughter's Electronic Ticket Record (ETR).  Allow me to explain my 
findings.  According to her ETR, we received an advance notice 
indicating she is allergic to peanuts.  This advance request alerted our
teams at the airport and onboard your flights to the type of assistance 
you daughter required.  En plus, you verbally informed our gate agent 
and our flight attendant onboard Flight 1864.  Despite all this, our 
flight attendants failed to adhere to Delta's internal policies 
regarding the service of peanut three rows forward and three rows aft of
a passenger with a peanut allergy.

Accordingly, our records show a violation of 14CFR, Part 382 has 
occurred.  As such, I want you to be assured that I have shared a copy 
of your communication with our Minneapolis Inflight and Airport Customer
Service leadership teams so they can review our procedures and initiate 
appropriate internal processes to prevent a recurrence of this event.  
We want to ensure we are providing the very best service possible when 
special assistance is required.  While I hope that I have addressed your
concerns in a satisfactory manner, you also have the right to contact 
the United States Department of Transportation Aviation Consumer 
Protection Division if you wish to pursue this matter further…..”

Again on September 8th, Jeremiah Edward, Delta’s Coordinator of Customer Care wrote to my father in-law who was traveling with my daughter and son:

Dear Mr. XXX, 

RE: Case Number 1120738

Thank you for writing on behalf of Ms. XXX XXX, Ms. XXX 
Brown, and Mr. XXXX Brown regarding the service provided while they
traveled with us on Delta Flight 1864 from Minneapolis to District of 
Columbia Airport on 03 September 2010.  On behalf of everyone at Delta 
Air Lines, I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience, frustration, and
concern caused as a result of our flight attendant's failure to assist 
Ms. XXX Brown with respect to her peanut allergy.

We appreciate the time you took to share Ms. Brown's experience not 
receiving appropriate assistance to accommodate her disability.  After 
reading your remarks, I certainly understand why you wanted to bring 
this matter to our attention.  Please know we want to make travel with 
us a convenient and trouble-free experience for all our passengers with 
special needs.  If a customer requires assistance in any form, we want 
to provide them this help in a timely and caring manner….

I have taken a moment to carefully review your communication and Ms. 
Brown's Electronic Ticket Record (ETR).  Allow me to explain my 
findings.  According to her ETR, we received an advance notice 
indicating she has an allergy to peanuts.  This advance request alerted 
our teams at the airport and onboard her flight to the type of 
assistance she required.  Moreover, the gate agents and flight 
attendants servicing Flight 1864 were informed of Ms. Brown's allergy 
prior to departure.  However, as you indicated, our flight attendant 
failed to uphold Delta's system for accommodating passengers with peanut
allergies and offered peanuts to Ms. Brown and the other passengers 
seated in her row.

Accordingly, my research shows a violation of United States Code of 
Federal Regulations 14, Part 382 has occurred.  I will, again, be 
sharing your communication with our Inflight and Airport Customer 
Service leadership teams so they can review our procedures in an effort 
to prevent a recurrence of this event.”

I am happy to share the full record of our correspondence with Delta Airlines should it be of interest to you.  Nevertheless, despite following all the procedures recommended by Delta Airlines, Delta’s in-flight personnel were unable to adhere to the airlines’ own internal guidance…not once but twice in little over a month.

We do not view a peanut allergy as a disability.  Millions of adults and children have food allergies and thanks to improved food labeling are able to avoid exposure to allergens.  Unfortunately, it is not always easy or possible to avoid flying on airlines that serve peanuts.  We have tried our best to avoid unhealthy situations, but clearly harried flight attendants are not always the best at enforcing an airlines’ policy on peanuts.   Accidents happen, but I believe that the Department of Transportation should issue a rule that protects vulnerable adults and children by requiring airlines to discontinue serving peanuts and peanut products on all flights.

Sincerely,
	-Geoffrey Brown",,,,,,,

We have to try and help these passengers as much as possilbe and sometimes we just can't get them out until the next day. I think it would be a good idea to up the fees. I know the airlines count on the passengers not using these vouchers but still. Why should someone who is going to a wedding or whatever have to be bumped off a flight? I really do get they want to make money but by overselling flights? Being bumped off a flight due to the aircraft being to heavy is bad enough for the passengers. The airlines should be giving them a break and not overselling the flights or go back to adding fees to go standby on a flight and only being charged if the passenger gets on the flight.",,,,,,,

Greetings, 

I support the proposed ban of peanuts from airlines and ask that the Air Transport Authority (ATA) position itself in favor of the proposed ban. Airline representatives are stating to the press that they’ll defer to the Air Transport Association on the matter, and the food allergic community worldwide is eagerly anticipating your support. 

We appreciate that the ATA is the trade organization for 90% of all U.S. airline passenger traffic, and that in response to the prosed rules, the ATA President and CEO Mr. James C. May stated that “The ATA member airlines’ shared goal is to provide a safe, efficient, reliable and economically viable air transportation system consistent with the expectations of their customers, employees and shareholders. Today’s DOT notice of proposed rule making will be evaluated against that standard, with a focus on minimizing potential passenger inconvenience.” We also appreciate that in the ATA agenda, it states that safety is the airlines’ top priority. 

The Department of Transportation says that passengers with severe peanut allergies qualify as disabled since the condition limits flying, a major life activity. The Air Carrier Access Act prohibits discrimination by airlines against passengers with disabilities. As a result, DOT is considering a ban on peanuts during flights. We agree that the issues allergic passengers and their families face in flight are an emerging safety issue and human rights/disability issue. 

Food allergy as a disability is difficult for people without it to understand since the disability is hidden. It’s hard to comprehend that a completely healthy person can be dead within minutes from a severe allergic reaction. Of food allergens, peanuts and tree nuts cause more than 90% of fatalities and have a high rate of symptoms from minimal contact, such as traces of peanut on flight attendants’ hands or on other surfaces. This too is hard to comprehend: A few invisible molecules of nut protein can cause death. 

In contrast, it’s easy to see why people in wheelchairs need special accommodation on flights. The website www.disabilitytravel.com suggests that passengers in wheelchairs give advance notice to the airline that they’re traveling by wheelchair, request maximum assistance at all airport terminals, obtain permission to gate check the wheelchair (board the flight in it), and have an attendant move them to their seat in an aisle wheelchair. There likely was some grumbling when every airline had to become wheelchair accessible, but it’s now an accepted part of plane travel. 

Passengers that are vegetarian have also been fully accommodated on flights, and they can expect a meal that meets their dietary preferences. Approximately 3% of Americans are vegetarians. Airlines voluntarily took on the cost involved in modifying menus and paying special care to passenger meals, despite the fact that a vegetarian’s life is not at risk if he or she eats something that contains meat. 

It makes business sense to ban peanuts from airplanes. Peanut and nut allergies in children more than tripled between 1997 and 2008. People allergic to peanuts are told by their allergists to avoid tree nuts too, in an effort to avoid sensitization and to increase the odds of outgrowing the allergy. In 2008, the combined rate of these two allergies was 2.1 percent of US children under 18 and 1.3% of adults, a total of 4,587,905 individuals. 

Airline ticket sales are lost not only to these allergic passengers, but to their travel companions. If the allergic passenger takes a trip with three family members, that brings the impact of nut allergy up to 18,351,620 potential lost sales representing almost 6% of the US population. This is the “ripple effect” of food allergy. 

If it makes business sense to accommodate the 3% of passengers who are vegetarian, it should make business sense to accommodate the 6% affected by peanut or tree nut allergy. 

The peanut industry cites that $20 million in sales may be lost. It’s not that travelers will stop eating peanuts, they will just stop being provided them on planes. If travel isn’t the same without eating peanuts along the way, then perhaps more peanuts will be sold at kiosks before and after flights. 

Should an air traveler have a severe allergic reaction during a flight, an emergency landing would be needed. The estimated cost to divert an A330 international flight would be at least $250,000.00, a substantial cost to the airline and a substantial inconvenience to other travelers. On the topic of cost to the airlines of continuing to serve nuts, peanut allergy doesn’t just cause discomfort, it can cause death. 

Now that these issues are on the table, the potential liability to airlines far exceeds the $20 million peanut farmers may lose. Failure to ban peanuts costs airlines lost ticket sales, the cost of diverted flights, and increased liability. It simply makes business sense to ban peanuts from airplanes. 

While DOT is restricted by legislation which provides that it cannot put any final rules in place until 90 days after submission to the Congress of a peer-reviewed scientific study, DOT continues to solicit public comments until August 9, 2010 about peanuts on airplanes, and the Department will consider them and decide whether or not to propose a further review. The ATA does not fall under that restriction, and it is hoped that in the interim, your agency will formulate a position that encourages DOT to proceed with this initiative, and encourage airlines that voluntarily wish to ban peanuts to do so.

It has created a great hardship for the full and part time residents since their flights have ceased.  There is minimal healthcare- just a clinic, no hospital, no dialyisis which is needed for several of our residents, no pharmacy, retail stores or other services required by residents on the island.  The ferry service has been inconsistent and extremely time consuming to get from Culebra to Fajardo, a 1 1/2 ferry ride. and then to San Juan which is an hour away. Tourism on the island has been negatively affected which in response has damaged businesses, employment etc.
The current charter services available are unaffordable for most of the residents of Culebra.
It is extremely important that Air Flamenco fly scheduled flights to maintain the economy of the island and the healthcare of the residents and hope that this will be approved.

Air Flamenco’s safety record is spotless and its crew and management are the best that service Culebra.

Culebra is a small community and Air Flamenco is a big part of that community.  The loss of Air Flamenco's ability to service its community has been a great blow to Culebra's economic wellbeing and the effects of this have extended to the social and psychological fiber of the island.  

We need to restore Air Flamenco's flights immediately and give this small island a chance to thrive before further irreparable damage is done.",,,,,,,
