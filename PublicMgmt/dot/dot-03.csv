 I am writing to express my opposition to the Department of Transportation's proposed adoption of a system of records under the Privacy Act of 1974. Exempting such an extremely broad and vaguely-defined system of records from the Privacy Act (as proposed) eviscerates the Privacy Act's protections. By storing massive amounts of information about every air traveler, this system would violate privacy and erode other civil liberties -- without increasing security or making the public safer.


The proposal uses open-ended terms like ""associated information"" and ""proprietary information,"" which essentially place no limits on the Category of Records being tracked. Given the volume of personal information being stored, the ""safeguards"" described in this proposal are woefully insufficient; this will inevitably lead to privacy violations on a massive scale -- making the recent theft of medical data and other sensitive personal information held by TriWest Corporation of ""only"" 500,000 military people look small by contrast.
 
 


The Routine Uses described for this information will needlessly harm civil liberties. For example, the subjectivity and inaccuracy of many of the sources of this information (including public source information, proprietary data, and law enforcement information) could result in law-abiding people being denied the right to travel.  Compounding the problem is that the proposed rule offers individuals inadequate Record Access Procedures, and no recourse for any type of infringement of their rights.


Rather than improving security, implementation of this rule would probably make us more vulnerable by miring security personnel in pointlessly scrutinizing innocent travelers.


Finally, at a time when other surveillance systems such as the Total Information Awareness Program are coming under heavy scrutiny by Congress, a rule such as this, governing the collection, storage, and disclosure of sensitive personal information about virtually every US citizen, should be exposed to a much wider discussion and debate. 
 
 For these reasons the proposed rule should be withdrawn.

Rather than improving security, implementation of this rule would probably make us more vulnerable by miring security personnel in pointlessly scrutinizing innocent travelers.

This proposal outlines a sever violation of my privacy which is difficult to regulate and seems to serve no real concrete purpose as it is presented. The blanket exemption from the Privacy Act completely undermines the laws that preserve our most sacred civil liberties.

Dear Director, 

I am writing to express my opposition to the Department of Transportation's proposed adoption of a system of records under the Privacy Act of 1974.

In that time, I spend tens of hours on the phone attempting to determine the purpose of the $20 charge, and made tens of attempts to pay it (just to get rid of it), but the utility in question refused to acknowledge the debt owed...even as they continued to negatively update my credit report every few months.

Even now, though I have been assured that it is taken care of (after officially challenging it with the credit companies and having them once again affirm it, I used this to get the utility to accept the $20), it continues to impact my life negatively. I cannot qualify for top-tier auto loans, my first mortgage was thrown into jeopardy at the last minute, and the sheer volume of stress has been at times overwhelming.

Please consider that this occurred because of a single error on a public utility's part, and I have only been able to (supposedly) correct it by (a) having access to the information in my file, (b) paying $20 that I didn't really owe, and (c) having laws that allowed me to contest the incorrect data and demand contact information for the person who claimed it was correct.

With this action, you will be creating a database that contains information about me that could have an equally (if not moreso) negative impact on my life. An erroneous piece of information accidentally placed on my file could (at the very least) prevent me from flying and expose me to prejudice from flight and security personnel, and (theoretically) expose me to surveillance, detainment or arrest. Unlike my credit report situation, I will have no recourse to (a) have access to the information in my file, (b) take steps to correct that data, or (c) have the right to contest the incorrect data and demand to know who placed it there.

I sincerely hope you will reconsider this ill-conceived plan, or at least make it possible to access your own record, contest incorrect information and file a comment if the information cannot be corrected, as we are allowed to do with credit reports. This will not solve the problem, but will at least allow individuals some power without diluting the stated purpose of this measure.

Additionally, please consider limiting either the type of information stored or the individuals who have access to it. Again, as with the credit report, information of this nature in the wrong hands will make identity theft and other crimes easy for those with access...and the more people with access, the more likely they are to believe that they'd get away with such activity.


A single credit report error has had a significant negative effect on my life; at least I could review the data and take steps to correct it. Your proposal has the potential to cause equal or greater harm, yet has no provision for oversight or correction of incorrect data. This is an extremely bad thing, and I hope you will reconsider.",,,,,,,"postmarkDate, Answer Date, Date the document was postmarked"

This system, which would store information on every air traveler, is ill-defined.  The definitions of the information to be collected are broad enough to allow almost any personal data to be tracked.  Operating such a system without the protections of the Privacy Act removes all public oversight.  The public has no way of knowing what data is collected by them or verifying its accuracy.

It is doubtful whether such a system would improve public safety.  This system, as proposed, will contain information on a vast number of innocent travelers.  It is unclear whether such a vast collection could be promptly and effectively searched to find criminal activity.  No matter what search criteria are used, the chance for false positives is high.

It is also doubtful whether the Department of Transportation can secure such a database.  The potential of abuse is obvious, should such a database be compromised.  Depending on the data collected--which, again, could include almost anything--any compromise of this database could release financial information, credit card numbers, travel itineraries and destinations and confidential details from law enforcement investigations.  Nothing in this proposal indicates that adequate safeguards will be in place for this data.  The potential for compromise of such a database is quite real, as evidenced by the recent problems with Tricare.

When I look over this proposal, I see an ill-conceived system which would introduce several new privacy risks for the American air traveler.  I see the increased expense of a vast program to collect, store and secure data.  I see a process attempting to hide from public scrutiny and from the protections afforded us under the 1974 Privacy Act.

I do not see any tangible benefits, and I do not see anything that would outweigh the above concerns.


This system presents grave privacy risks and unnecessary added expense.  It does not present any obvious benefit.",,,,,,,"postmarkDate, Answer Date, Date the document was postmarked"

This information will supposedly be used to help protect the U.S. against terrorist activity.  However, it seems to me that this proposal would do little to increase our safety, but would result in a significant reduction in the civil liberties of American citizens.  It is during times such as this, when it is so tempting to institute efforts to increase the safety of Americans that we need to be careful that those efforts do not impinge on the very civil liberties that have made our country a beacon of hope to millions around the world.

As I understand the proposed action a database of information regarding the travel habits of everyday Americans would be gathered and held in secrecy.  Individuals would have no right to examine the information gathered about them.  Without such access persons would be unable to correct any misinformation in their file.  Furthermore, such a system, by targeting anyone who travels by air effectively treats all persons as potential criminals and allows dossiers to be assembled about them without their being convicted - or even suspected of - any particular crime.  Such surveillance activities are reminiscent of those undertaken by such notorious organs of state repression as the former Soviet KGB and the Nazi Gestapo.  Such screening and surveillance activities are a direct assault upon the freedoms that Americans have traditionally and by law enjoyed.  I urge you to reject this proposal as the ineffective crime fighting tool that it would be.  No such system deserves a place in American society and its adoption would mark yet another step along the path of increasing the police powers of the state.

Exempting such an extremely broad and vaguely-defined system of records from the Privacy Act (as proposed) eviscerates the Privacy Act's protections.  By storing massive amounts of information about every air traveler, this system would violate privacy and erode other civil liberties -- without increasing security or making the public safer.  

The proposal uses open-ended terms like ""associated information"" and ""proprietary information,"" which essentially place no limits on the Category of Records being tracked. Given the volume of personal information being stored, the ""safeguards"" described in this proposal are woefully insufficient; this will inevitably lead to privacy violations on a massive scale -- making the recent theft of medical data and other sensitive personal information held by TriWest Corporation of ""only"" 500,000 military people look small by contrast.

The Routine Uses described for this information will needlessly harm civil liberties. For example, the subjectivity and inaccuracy of many of the sources of this information (including public source information, proprietary data, and law enforcement information) could result in law-abiding people being denied the right to travel.  Compounding the problem is that the proposed rule offers individuals inadequate Record Access Procedures, and no recourse for any type of infringement of their rights.

Rather than improving security, implementation of this rule would probably make us more vulnerable by miring security personnel in pointlessly scrutinizing innocent travelers.

Finally, at a time when other surveillance systems such as the Total Information Awareness Program are coming under heavy scrutiny by Congress, a rule such as this, governing the collection, storage, and disclosure of sensitive personal information about virtually every US citizen, should be exposed to a much wider discussion and debate.

For these reasons the proposed rule should be withdrawn. If not I (and many many more like me) will no longer use air travel in the U.S.

Sincerely,
Brian Koenigsdorf.

Privacy Act of 1974, as currently written, is a bad idea.
The Department of Transportation's proposed exemptions makes the title into a parody of itself.
The proposal uses open-ended terms like ""associated information"" and ""proprietary information,"" which essentially place no limits on the Category of Records being tracked. Given the volume of personal information being stored, the ""safeguards"" described in this proposal are woefully insufficient; this will inevitably lead to privacy violations on a massive scale --  the recent theft of medical data and other sensitive personal information held by TriWest Corporation of ""only"" 500,000 military people is an example of the danger.

There is no method outlined to verify or challenge any data. Normal screwups and malicious actors would generate Kafka-esque torment for many innocent people. Secret snitches and untracable informants were a bad aspect of the old Soviet Union. They do not belong in our Country.
Abuses and thefts of databases are a daily headline in the newspapers. Setting up a database that is designed with no corrective procedure, with no accountability and no limits on intrusiveness is repugnant to common sense.
It will do less than nothing to help security. It would bleed money away from any other security efforts, and it would waste security personnel's time in pointlessly scrutinizing innocent travelers.
For these reasons the proposed rule should be withdrawn.

Also, the inability of individuals who would appear on this list to verify or correct their personal information in this database is a serious drawback, and more resembles the actions of a police state intent on monitoring its citizenry than a democracy.  We should not trade our freedoms and our right to privacy for a dubiously devised solution without far-ranging and serious study as to its limitations.

For these reasons the proposed rule should be withdrawn.

Exempting such an extremely broad and vaguely-defined system of records from the Privacy Act (as proposed) eviscerates the Privacy Acts protections.  By storing massive amounts of information about every air traveler, this system would violate privacy and erode other civil liberties  without increasing security or making the public safer.  
The proposal uses open-ended terms like associated information and proprietary information, which essentially place no limits on the Category of Records being tracked. Given the volume of personal information being stored, the safeguards described in this proposal are woefully insufficient; this will inevitably lead to privacy violations on a massive scale  making the recent theft of medical data and other sensitive personal information held by TriWest Corporation of ""only"" 500,000 military people look small by contrast.
The Routine Uses described for this information will needlessly harm civil liberties.  For example, the subjectivity and inaccuracy of many of the sources of this information (including public source information, proprietary data, and law enforcement information) could result in law-abiding people being denied the right to travel.  Compounding the problem is that the proposed rule offers individuals inadequate Record Access Procedures, and no recourse for any type of infringement of their rights.
Rather than improving security, implementation of this rule would probably make us more vulnerable by miring security personnel in pointlessly scrutinizing innocent travelers.  
Finally, at a time when other surveillance systems such as the Total Information Awareness Program are coming under heavy scrutiny by Congress, a rule such as this, governing the collection, storage, and disclosure of sensitive personal information about virtually every US citizen, should be exposed to a much wider discussion and debate. 
For these reasons the proposed rule should be withdrawn.

1. The proposed system is overbroad. The stated purpose is to
improve aviation security; however the ""Routine Uses"" of the
information are much broader. The proposal uses open-ended terms
like ""associated information"" and ""proprietary information,""
which essentially place no limits on the Category of Records

2. The safeguards proposed by the system are far too weak
considering the broad scope of the information to be saved. This
will inevitably lead to privacy violations on a massive scale --
making the recent theft of medical data and other sensitive
personal information held by TriWest Corporation of ""only""

3. The subjectivity and inaccuracy of many of the sources of
this information (including public source information,
proprietary data, and law enforcement information) could result
in law-abiding people being denied the right to
travel. Furthermore, the proposed rule offers individuals
inadequate Record Access Procedures, and no recourse for any
type of infringement of their rights. There is no way for
incorrect information to be corrected by an individual.

4. An individual may only see information provided by the
individual.  Furthermore, since an individual must identify the
system from which the individual is seeking records, and include
a general description of the records sought, it is likely that
large parts of it will not be available. There is no way for an
individual to examine any records collected by governmental
agencies or corporations.

5. Implementation of this rule would probably make us more
vulnerable since it would mire security personnel in pointlessly
scrutinizing the large volumes of data collected on innocent
travelers.

6. At a time when other surveillance systems such as the Total

I oppose the proposed action strongly. The proposed system is overbroad both in the information to be collected and its intended uses. The safeguards proposed are too weak. It offers no way for incorrect information to be corrected by an individual. An individual may only see information provided by the individual -- not any information collected by the government or corporations. It will also swamp security personnel in vast volumes of data. Information collection of this scale on U.S. Citizens should be subjected to much greater Congressional and public scrutiny.",,,,,,,"postmarkDate, Answer Date, Date the document was postmarked"

Dear Director, 

I am writing to express my opposition to the Department of Transportation's proposed adoption of a system of records under the Privacy Act of 1974.  Exempting such an extremely broad and vaguely-defined system of records from the Privacy Act (as proposed) eviscerates the Privacy Acts protections.  By storing massive amounts of information about every air traveler, this system would violate privacy and erode other civil liberties  without increasing security or making the public safer.  

The proposal uses open-ended terms like associated information and proprietary information, which essentially place no limits on the Category of Records being tracked. Given the volume of personal information being stored, the safeguards described in this proposal are woefully insufficient; this will inevitably lead to privacy violations on a massive scale  making the recent theft of medical data and other sensitive personal information held by TriWest Corporation of ""only"" 500,000 military people look small by contrast.

The Routine Uses described for this information will needlessly harm civil liberties.  For example, the subjectivity and inaccuracy of many of the sources of this information (including public source information, proprietary data, and law enforcement information) could result in law-abiding people being denied the right to travel.  Compounding the problem is that the proposed rule offers individuals inadequate Record Access Procedures, and no recourse for any type of infringement of their rights.

Rather than improving security, implementation of this rule would probably make us more vulnerable by miring security personnel in pointlessly scrutinizing innocent travelers.  

Finally, at a time when other surveillance systems such as the Total Information Awareness Program are coming under heavy scrutiny by Congress, a rule such as this, governing the collection, storage, and disclosure of sensitive personal information about virtually every US citizen, should be exposed to a much wider discussion and debate. 

For these reasons the proposed rule should be withdrawn. 

Thank you for your time and the opportunity to voice my concerns. 

Sincerely,

Dear Director, 

I am writing to express my opposition to the Department of Transportation's proposed adoption of a system of records under the Privacy Act of 1974.  

I am only too familiar with incorrect information being associated with my record by a government agency.  For the past year and a half the California DMV has associated my record with an incorrect texas driving record indicating that the owner of this record had several infractions and accidents.  My personal record is clean but after my insurance company reviewed the incorrect driving record my rate went up more than 1000 dollars extra a month.  Moreover, my record became associate with an AKA which  I had never admited and for which my name has no relation at all.  I had to coordinate with the DMV in Texas and California and handle the problems with my insurance agency.  Thankfully a year and a half after the existence of this incorrect record came to my attention the matter was resolved and I now enjoy a spotless driving record.  This is nothing compared to the types of errors that may occur in a system such as that proposed.

Exempting such an extremely broad and vaguely-defined system of records from the Privacy Act (as proposed) eviscerates the Privacy Acts protections.  By storing massive amounts of information about every air traveler, this system would violate privacy and erode other civil liberties  without increasing security or making the public safer.

I believe this system would violate privacy and erode other civil liberties -- without increasing security or making the public safer.

Dear Director, 

I am writing to express my opposition to the Department of Transportation's proposed adoption of a system of records under the Privacy Act of 1974.  I am deeply concerned about the potential for privacy violations under this proposal.

I am also concerned about the harm to civil liberties that would result from the subjectivity and inaccuracy of many of the sources of this information (including public source information, proprietary data) that could result in law-abiding people being denied the right to travel.  Compounding the problem is that the proposed rule offers individuals inadequate Record Access Procedures, and no recourse for any type of infringement of their rights.

Rather than improving security, implementation of this rule would probably make us more vulnerable by miring security personnel in pointlessly scrutinizing innocent travelers and exposing citizens to greater risk of identity theft without commesurate benefits.

Finally, at a time when other surveillance systems such as the Total Information Awareness Program are coming under heavy scrutiny by Congress, a rule such as this, governing the collection, storage, and disclosure of sensitive personal information about virtually every US citizen, should be exposed to a much wider discussion and debate. 

For these reasons the proposed rule should be withdrawn.

Sir -
 
I must strenuously object to the DoT's proposed 'system of record under
the Privacy Act of 1974', Aviation Security Screening Records. Adopting
such a far-reaching system with so little in the way of safeguard for
privacy or other civil liberties seems like it's ripe for abuse - whether
internally by the government, or externally by some malicious outsider.
 
In addition, the existence of such a system would call for increased
workload of airport security personnel, an already overworked and
understaffed group.
 
Finally, it troubles me that such a comprehensive system would be 
adopted without public input; these sorts of privacy concerns are
becoming increasingly important to the citizenry at large, and
should be subjected to intense scrutiny.
 
With these concerns, the proposed rule should be withdrawn.
 
Yours,
Tom Spindler

I wish to express my strong opposition to the Department of Transportation's proposed adoption of a system of records under the Privacy Act of 1974.  

I believe that exempting such an extremely broad and vaguely-defined system of records from the Privacy Act (as proposed) completely guts the protections the of the Privacy Act.  

By storing massive amounts of information about every air traveler, this system would violate privacy and erode other civil liberties. Worse, it would do so without increasing security or making the public safer.  

The proposals use of open-ended terms (e.g., associated information and proprietary information"") place no limits on the Category of Records being tracked. 

Given both the breadth and the volume of personal information being stored, the safeguards described in this proposal are completely and woefully insufficient. It is virtually certain that this proposal will lead to privacy violations on a massive scale. 

For example, this would make the recent theft of medical data and other sensitive personal information held by TriWest Corporation of ""only"" 500,000 military people look small by contrast.

The Routine Uses described for this information will needlessly harm civil liberties.  For example, the subjectivity and inaccuracy of many of the sources of this information (including public source information, proprietary data, and law enforcement information) could result in law-abiding people being denied the right to travel.  

Further compounding the problem is that the proposed rule offers individuals completely inadequate Record Access Procedures, and no recourse for any type of infringement of their rights.

This rule would not improve security. Rather, it would probably make us more vulnerable by causing security personnel to pointlessly scrutinize and victimize totally innocent travelers.  

At a time when other surveillance systems such as the Total Information Awareness Program are coming under heavy scrutiny by Congress, a rule such as this, governing the collection, storage, and disclosure of sensitive personal information about virtually every US citizen, absolutely MUST be exposed to a much wider discussion and debate. 

For these reasons the proposed rule should be withdrawn. 

Thank you for your time and the opportunity to voice my concerns.

 Dear Director, 
 
 I am writing to express my opposition to the Department of Transportation's proposed adoption of a system of records under the Privacy Act of 1974.  Exempting such an extremely broad and vaguely-defined system of records from the Privacy Act (as proposed) eviscerates the Privacy Act's protections.  By storing massive amounts of information about every air traveler, this system would violate privacy and erode other civil liberties -- without increasing security or making the public safer.




The proposal uses open-ended terms like ""associated information"" and ""proprietary information,"" which essentially place no limits on the Category of Records being tracked. Given the volume of personal information being stored, the ""safeguards"" described in this proposal are woefully insufficient; this will inevitably lead to privacy violations on a massive scale -- making the recent theft of medical data and other sensitive personal information held by TriWest Corporation of ""only"" 500,000 military people look small by contrast.
 
 




The Routine Uses described for this information will needlessly harm civil liberties.  For example, the subjectivity and inaccuracy of many of the sources of this information (including public source information, proprietary data, and law enforcement information) could result in law-abiding people being denied the right to travel.  Compounding the problem is that the proposed rule offers individuals inadequate Record Access Procedures, and no recourse for any type of infringement of their rights.




Rather than improving security, implementation of this rule would probably make us more vulnerable by miring security personnel in pointlessly scrutinizing innocent travelers.




Finally, at a time when other surveillance systems such as the Total Information Awareness Program are coming under heavy scrutiny by Congress, a rule such as this, governing the collection, storage, and disclosure of sensitive personal information about virtually every US citizen, should be exposed to a much wider discussion and debate.

Documentary Services Division 
Attention: Docket Section, Room PL-101 
Docket No. OST-1996-1437 
Department of Transportation, SVC-124 
Washington, DC 20590 

Dear Director, 

I am writing to express my opposition to the Department of Transportation's proposed adoption of a system of records under the Privacy Act of 1974. Exempting such an extremely broad and vaguely-defined system of records from the Privacy Act (as proposed) eviscerates the Privacy Act's protections. By storing massive amounts of information about every air traveler, this system would violate privacy and erode other civil liberties -- without increasing security or making the public safer.

The proposal uses open-ended terms like ""associated information"" and ""proprietary information,"" which essentially place no limits on the Category of Records being tracked. Given the volume of personal information being stored, the ""safeguards"" described in this proposal are woefully insufficient; this will inevitably lead to privacy violations on a massive scale -- making the recent theft of medical data and other sensitive personal information held by TriWest Corporation of ""only"" 500,000 military people look small by contrast.



The Routine Uses described for this information will needlessly harm civil liberties. For example, the subjectivity and inaccuracy of many of the sources of this information (including public source information, proprietary data, and law enforcement information) could result in law-abiding people being denied the right to travel.  Compounding the problem is that the proposed rule offers individuals inadequate Record Access Procedures, and no recourse for any type of infringement of their rights.

Rather than improving security, implementation of this rule would probably make us more vulnerable by miring security personnel in pointlessly scrutinizing innocent travelers.

Finally, at a time when other surveillance systems such as the Total Information Awareness Program are coming under heavy scrutiny by Congress, a rule such as this, governing the collection, storage, and disclosure of sensitive personal information about virtually every US citizen, should be exposed to a much wider discussion and debate. 

For these reasons the proposed rule should be withdrawn. 

Thank you for your time and the opportunity to voice my concerns. 

Sincerely,

Trent Geerdes

today.  Unfortunately, I can not find any information on it.  The only
information I have so far is hearsay, but what I've heard sound very
irresponsible, if it is in fact true.

I have no objection to computer-assisted pre-screening to determine if
someone should get a higher level of screening at the airport.  However,
what I've heard is that this database will be open to anyone, including
the news media.  There is (or at least should be) a fairly obvious line
drawn between the agencies working for my security and the agencies trying
to gain my information in order to sell it to marketing firms and god
knows who else.

The information gathered and contained in this database should be
absolutely confidential, available only to those people who are working to
improve security, and the person who is the subject of the data collection.  Perhaps this is already the plan, but that is not what I have heard.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Brian Clark

Dear Director, 

I am writing to express my opposition to the Department of Transportation's proposed exemption of risk assessments and the
information contained in those assessments from the Privacy Act of 1974.  The proposal to exempt such a potentially broad
and vaguely-defined system of records from the Privacy Act eviscerates the Privacy Act's protections. By storing massive
amounts of information about every air traveler, this system would violate privacy and erode other civil liberties  without
increasing security or making the public safer.

By exempting all risk assessment reports and the information contained in those reports, this third notice suffers from the same
defects as the previous two notices published in the Federal Register.  Exempting risk assessment reports and the information
that populates them would remove accountability to the individual.  Individuals would not be allowed to access the information
contained about them, nor would they be notified if files were being kept on them or her. This is very serious in light of the fact
that investigatory material could be included in these reports  without providing any mechanism for the individual to see if the
information is correct; and that categories of sources of information would also be kept secret from the individual. 

Even though the Privacy Act does allow for exemptions to protect national security and to help law enforcement, the
exemptions that the DoT envisions are far too broad and allow the creation of large secret files on individuals  the very thing
the Privacy Act was passed to prevent. 

Finally, at a time when other surveillance systems such as the Total Information Awareness Program are coming under heavy
scrutiny by Congress, a rule such as this, governing the collection, storage, and disclosure of sensitive personal information
about virtually every US citizen, should be exposed to a much wider discussion and debate. 

For these reasons the proposed rule should be withdrawn. 

Thank you for your time and the opportunity to voice my concerns. 

Sincerely,

Mel Mann

CAPPS II is ill-conceived in that it allows too much control in the hands of the TSA.  The TSA must not be allowed this power.  
Airlines and by extension, the TSA, has no reason to snoop through my financial records when I try to buy a ticket on an airline.

A Lay Explanation of the MIT Research Paper ""Carnival Booth: An Algorithm for Defeating the Computer-Assisted Passenger Screening System""

By Russell L. Brand

Imagine a world where you knew who all the terrorists were in advance. It is a much simpler world than the one we have. There would be no waiting in airport security lines.

While we don't have that, some people think we are in a world where we know who the terrorists ARE NOT. And in that world, we can avoid searching the people we know are safe and devote all (or most of) our effort just to the people were aren't sure of. It sounds good. Some of us avoid being hassled and the system moves faster for everyone.

BUT ...

What if we are occasionally wrong? Just a few of these SEEMINGLY SAFE people are really terrorists. They'd slip by with us good upstanding citizens.

And what if the terrorist organizations sent all their folks on a few test trips? After a few trips, they would know which ones got searched each time and which ones never got searched. Then they would use the ones that had never gotten searched on their mission, knowing that these SEEMINGLY SAFE people (who were really terrorists) could more easily get onto the planes.

Unfortunately, the efforts to target our searching attention, rather than better protecting us and more efficiently using our resources, instead telegraphs what we know and allows the bad guys to have a better chance of out maneuvering us.

While the intuition of this is easy to understand, it took a team of leading mathematicians at MIT to prove that it is true and to show that their are no simple fixes to the targeted approach. And the implications of their findings cannot be ignored.

It is critically important to not let a terrorist know whether or not he is a suspect until the moment we capture him. And unfortunately, that means long lines for us all.

If the airlines implement CAPPS-II I will avoid flying as much as possible and hope that all the airlines end up like PanAm or other memories.

Dear Director, 

I am writing to express my opposition to the Department of Transportation's proposed exemption of risk assessments and the information contained in those assessments from the Privacy Act of 1974.  The proposal to exempt such a potentially broad and vaguely-defined system of records from the Privacy Act eviscerates the Privacy Act's protections. By storing massive amounts of information about every air traveler, this system would violate privacy and erode other civil liberties -- without increasing security or making the public safer.
By exempting all risk assessment reports and the information contained in those reports, this third notice suffers from the same defects as the previous two notices published in the Federal Register.  Exempting risk assessment reports and the information that populates them would remove accountability to the individual.  Individuals would not be allowed to access the information contained about them, nor would they be notified if files were being kept on them. This is very serious in light of the fact that investigatory material could be included in these reports -- without providing any mechanism for the individual to see if the information is correct; and that categories of sources of information would also be kept secret from the individual. 
Even though the Privacy Act does allow for exemptions to protect national security and to help law enforcement, the exemptions that the DoT envisions are far too broad and allow the creation of large secret files on individuals -- the very thing the Privacy Act was passed to prevent. 
Finally, at a time when other surveillance systems such as the Total Information Awareness Program are coming under heavy scrutiny by Congress, a rule such as this, governing the collection, storage, and disclosure of sensitive personal information about virtually every US citizen, should be exposed to a much wider discussion and debate. 

For these reasons the proposed rule should be withdrawn. 

Thank you for your time and the opportunity to voice my concerns. 

Sincerely,

Howard Fore

Those who would do us harm will find other ways to format their evil, while the far reaching implications of this legislation will place our citizenry more under a microscope than we currently are.  Inevitably, this information is bound to find its way, in some form, to other, non-governmental organizations.

The reinforcement of cockpit doors and the adoption of new cockpit security protocols is all that was needed to prevent the seizure of commercial airliners by terrorists for use as guided missiles.  Securing the passengers is already accomplished by metal detectors and x-rays which are anonymous searches and do not permit government to collect the personally identifying information that is called for by these regulations.  If government has done its job by sufficiently insuring that commercial airliners have reinforced cockpit doors and where it is conducting metal detection and x-ray examination of passengers to insure that they are not armed, the proposed regulations will not add any appreciable quantity of security while constituting an enormous invasion of personal privacy on the millions of air travellers who are committing no crime whatsoever.  Many of the new provisions wherein government has asked individuals to give up personal privacy and certain personal liberties for the sake of ¿security¿ are unneccesary and are going down the wrong path to find security.

Also, there is no system to ensure recompense to an individual unjustly denied boarding.

As computer systems (where the information would most likely be stored) are inherently insecure (especially the human element), then some people looking for information can easily break in and find almost every citizen's personally identifiable information, making it at great risk. 
This system also proposes pulling up the credit report of every person that flies, which lowers their credit rating. I do not want to have a low credit rating just because I need to go somewhere, this is truly un-American.
Finally, at a time when other surveillance systems such as the Total Information Awareness Program are coming under heavy scrutiny by Congress, a rule such as this, governing the collection, storage, and disclosure of sensitive personal information about virtually every US citizen, should be exposed to a much wider discussion and debate.

large step in the wrong direction for a country which is founded on, and claims still to believe in, personal freedoms.

In a perfect world, such a system might not have significant risks.   But that is not our world, and there is a large body of experience and example where such systems have caused considerable harm, been the source of dis- and misinformation, and generally not fulfilled the claims of their advocates.

A system such as proposed has no clear, or even believable, basis for stopping terrorism.  A person whose intent is to commit a
terrorist act can easily behave in a way which is well within norms and thereby evade detection.   There is no evidence whatsoever
to the contrary.  Yet, a secret system, one which is invisible and not subject to audit and examination by the public and the individuals it describes is subject to abuse, inaccuracy, creep and broadening of its stated objectives.   In addition, it will likely have a
significant direct cost, significant related costs on law enforcement and transportation companies, for (at the very best) unclear benefit.   Further, it is a step along a slippery slope which will make the next step seem a little less silly; I'd rather we didn't take the first step.

It is not appropriate, desirable, or reasonable to eliminate all scrutiny, risk assessment and notification, and Privacy Act (1974) controls from such a system, if it were to be built.   I would strongly prefer that it not be built, that CAPPS I be dismantled, and that
occasional random searches be the primary means of assuring air travel safety.


The proposed rules and system will not help security, are expensive and subject to abuse, error-prone, and lack sufficient public visibility and public scrutiny.   They should NOT be enacted.",,,,,,,"postmarkDate, Answer Date, Date the document was postmarked"

I want my government to be accountable.



Shrouding government actions in secrecy, by eliminating accountability, is abhorent to all thinking citizens.



The data in the underlying systems will be used by the government to make decisions affecting individuals.  The ability to review and correct alleged facts used by the government to make such decisions is important to all citizens, not just the affected individuals.



Recently published reports have shown that comercial databases of consumer information subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act have erroneous ""facts"" in 70% of the files.  These are errors.  The FCIR allows these to be discovered and corrected, to the benefit of both the customer and also the subject of such erroneous information.



If the DOT (or any government agency) creates a system without such elemental safeguards, then much of the data will be unreliable, and hence a waste of taxpayer dollars.  If such an agency relies upon commercial databases for input, then the presumption that that only true facts are in the government database is void.  This means that the government files will probably be even less reliable, since the facts gathered from non-commercial sources would not be discoverable nor correctable.



Also, if a citizen uses the FCIR to correct errors in his commercial credit files, there should be a guarantee that those corrections are reflected in the government databases in a timely manner.



Without the accountability provided by the Privacy Act, tax dollars would be wasted, government [agents] will make bad decisions, and innocent citizens will suffer the results of those bad decisions.

Dear Director, 

I am writing to express my opposition to the Department of Transportation's proposed exemption of risk assessments and the information contained in those assessments from the Privacy Act of 1974.  The proposal to exempt such a potentially broad and vaguely-defined system of records from the Privacy Act eviscerates the Privacy Act's protections. By storing massive amounts of information about every air traveler, this system would violate privacy and erode other civil liberties -- without increasing security or making the public safer.

My family has been directly affected by identity theft. This is a real and all too common problem. Unauthorized access to databases is a well-publicized occurrence. This is not only an invasion of privacy; there is also significant risk that the information cannot be guaranteed safe and accurate.

The data used to makes these assessments is broad and subject to error. There is little explanation as to how this data will be effective in providing greater security while it is clear that it is an invasion of privacy. In addition, there is no opportunity for those directly affected by these assessments to view the information, correct false information, or rectify the situation if categorized as unsafe. The data would be subject to exposure through hacking, and persons could be harmed by false information created by identity theft or intentional misinformation. 

For these reasons the proposed rule should be withdrawn. 

Thank you for your time and the opportunity to voice my concerns. 

Sincerely,
Donna Truax

I feel very strongly about protecting the country and it's citizens, but the recent news about the personal threat level database which has come to light today on CNN I find very disturbing.  I think this recent intrusion into peoples privacy is crossing the line.  Furthermore I find it and insult as a veteran that the very freedoms that I gave up part of my life and swore to protect are the very ones that the government seems hell bent on taking away from the citizens.  I feel that the whole reason that this country exists is to defend and protect those freedoms and show the world what democracy and freedom is.  I feel that the personal freedoms of the people of the United States need to be protected above all else, for that is the very heart of what makes this nation great. THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO PROTECT THOSE FREEDOMS!!!

The government is out of line checking the background of every citizen who flies on a plane.  This is only going to lead to people being marked and targeted needlessly and more of our personal freedoms being lost.  What is next, security checks for traveling on a train, or owning a car?   Is the government protecting us from those that would attack our freedoms and way of life, protecting us from ourselves, or becoming the very attacker of the freedoms for which it stands?

It is not the right of the government to target it's own when it has enough problems as it is keeping people out of our borders.  There is no reason that the government should be casting such a wide net amongst it's civilian population trying to catch just a few people that should never have gotten inside our borders to begin with.  To say that I am outraged with the current path that the government is undertaking domestically would be an understatement.  I do not always agree with the actions of the government, but I am very much a patriot, and I believe in exercising my personal rights and freedoms so as not to loose them.

I implore you to act against this gross threat to our freedoms and never forget that the government serves the people, not the other way around.  Serve the people and the people will always back you.  Go forward with this and the airlines will be bankrupted one at a time by the great citizens of this nation.

While I fully support the war on terrorism and understand that reasonable security measures must be implemented to keep terrorists off our airplanes, I cannot stomach the TSA proposed requirement that airlines with which I may fly must run a credit check on me, investigate my banking history (complete with checking and savings account number disclosures), and run a criminal background check on me.  According to written news accounts, all of the information gathered will be stored for fifty (50!) years on computers that may or may not be safe from malicious hackers out to steal my identity.  Furthermore, every time an airline runs a credit report on me under the program, my credit rating will suffer.  In short, my private financial and personal information is none of the airline's business nor that of the TSA.  I understand that Delta is currently the only airline involved in the pilot CAPPS program.  Consequently, I will most definitely not be flying Delta. Should the program expand to include other airlines, then I will be taking the train or bus or simply driving myself rather than submit to this kind of invasive questioning. Sincerely, James P.

I am writing as a citizen who as flown on Delta Airlines in the past year, to express my views on the CAPPS II (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System) program. I am appalled that the US Government is working with Delta to test this system, which I feel is in violation of US citizens' rights to personal privacy. Delta has no right to conduct background checks, obtain personal banking records and run credit checks on passengers in the name of ""security."" I also understand that those passengers given a threat asessment color of ""Red"" will not be allowed to fly.
 
How exactly are these threat assesments to be determined? How can you insure the safety of citizen's private banking, credit and other information Delta has gathered? How to you justify hurting people's credit rating by running additional credit reports on them? 
 
Additionally, I would like to know exactly how it was determined that this information will show definitively that a person poses a security risk; and why a person should be penalized by not being allowed to fly on your airline based on that information. I was under the impression that in the United States of America all citizens are innocent until proven guilty. 
 
Until Delta has officially stops using the the CAPPS II (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System) program I will no longer fly on this airline. I will be asking all my friends and relatives to join me in boycotting your airline. I am also sending letters to my congressmen regarding my views on this policy.
 
Please let me know what your intentions are in continuing this policy.
 
Sincerely,
Heather Dimon

Dear Director, 

I am writing to express my opposition to the Department of Transportation's proposed exemption of risk assessments and the information contained in those assessments from the Privacy Act of 1974.  The proposal to exempt such a potentially broad and vaguely-defined system of records from the Privacy Act eviscerates the Privacy Act's protections. By storing massive amounts of information about every air traveler, this system would violate privacy and erode other civil liberties -- without increasing security or making the public safer.
By exempting all risk assessment reports and the information contained in those reports, this third notice suffers from the same defects as the previous two notices published in the Federal Register.  Exempting risk assessment reports and the information that populates them would remove accountability to the individual.  Individuals would not be allowed to access the information contained about them, nor would they be notified if files were being kept on them. This is very serious in light of the fact that investigatory material could be included in these reports -- without providing any mechanism for the individual to see if the information is correct; and that categories of sources of information would also be kept secret from the individual. 
Even though the Privacy Act does allow for exemptions to protect national security and to help law enforcement, the exemptions that the DoT envisions are far too broad and allow the creation of large secret files on individuals -- the very thing the Privacy Act was passed to prevent. 
Finally, at a time when other surveillance systems such as the Total Information Awareness Program are coming under heavy scrutiny by Congress, a rule such as this, governing the collection, storage, and disclosure of sensitive personal information about virtually every US citizen, should be exposed to a much wider discussion and debate.

I am deeply concerned that this program will create a permanent blacklist of Americans who cannot travel freely, and hinder the security at our nation's airports.

I have read that people have already been stopped and banned from flying under initial government ""no fly"" lists and have been unable to clear their names, getting caught up in the federal bureaucracy.  This national system would only increase the delays and blacklist even more innocent Americans. Innocent people could be blocked or delayed in their travel for work and vacations based on mistakes, errors and false leads.

Given the chaos American airports will experience, actual terrorist threats will be harder to detect.  Terrorists will learn how to game the system by using false background information.  And the constant false alarms might divert the attention of airport security officers who - through training and experience - could detect actual threats.

If adopted, this system will use government and private companies' databases to build a profile of each passenger.  The compiled information could include credit history, travel history, housing information, membership in different organizations, employment records, and other personal information. Not only will this system be a tempting targets for hackers, but will also be prone to abuse by government and airline employees. 

Once again, I urge you to oppose this invasive and untrustworthy system.  

I look forward to hearing from you on this important matter.

First and foremost, this program poses grave danger to our system of privacy in this country.  It has been almost cliche to trounce on civil liberties since 9/11/01.  However, this is ridiculous.  I see no reason why this program has to exist, including national security.  Setting up a definitive system for determining risk is simply not effective.  Random searches are the most effective and the least predictable.  The CAPPS II system could easily be beaten and will simply hurt innocent people's lives in the doing.  Credit reporting is far from perfect and it would take nearly 100% accuracy for this system to be remotely legitimate.  Your administration (TSA) is simply taking this ""security"" system a little too far and is making the United States look like 1940s Germany when it comes to not trusting its own citizens.  Let's be realistic and stop painting rosy pictures about the life we could have with this.  Sacrifice freedom for security and you get neither.  We are not, and will not be, any safer today than we will with this system.  You have set yourself up for political ruin.

All this does is told the terrorists who you are looking for and what criteria is used to fly - they can then make sure that their operatives have the correct ""profile"" and can then get onto our planes.

Please think carefully about your choices.  In testing and implementing the CAPPS II program, you are undermining the freedom of our nation and threatening the financial security of the airline industry.  I fly frequently for work and enjoy travel for personal vacation.  I refuse to fly on any airline that uses the CAPPS II system.  If this means I must drive out of the country to use an airline based in Canada to avoid the system, I'll do it.  I am fortunate to live close enough to the border to make that a reasonable choice.

Some airlines may be financially secure enough to weather a fire-storm of customer discontent, but many others are not.  Until they discontinue use of CAPPSII, I won't travel on Delta, and I will not fly on any airline that uses the system.  This system undermines our way of life.

This shreds the 4th amendment and the right to privacy and treats all Americans as suspects.  Indeed, one can get on this list inadvertently and has incorrectly --- and they have no way to correct the situation -- there is no due process --- only the wall that it's top priority or secret.

The motive to create a system like this I believe to be inspired by fear and laziness.  Fear that we are under constant attack, and laziness in trying to find a real solution.  Concentrate your efforts on the holes that were exposed in the security system during the 9/11 attacks instead of trying to use the Big Brother approach to scare us all to death and control us all to death.  Things like this make me glad that I'm not a black american, or a foreigner of any kind.  You are creating a country where everyone is guilty until proven innocent.

Anti-discrimination rules are being taken to mean that the same flat charge has to be applied to all tickets. This is OK for air tickets, but when a rail ticket is issued as part of an air journey, this causes problems. The rail sector has a much lower fare than the air sector, and cannot stand the typical GDS charge. Consider Chicago - Newark - New York Penn, where the Newark - New York sector costs under $12. A standard GDS charge, plus commission, BSP charge and credit card charge leaves very little for New Jersey Transit!
Clarification that equal charges must be made for equal services would help - typically, on airport railways, no reservation is required (or possible), so less work is required by the GDS. Therefore the charge could legitimately be lower than an air journey - or even an Acela journey - where a reservation IS required.


A problem in Europe is that anti-discrimination requirements are read to mean that the same flat charge has to be made for each ticket issued. This is fine for high-fare air journeys, but not for low-fare rail journeys as part of an air journey (Chicago - Newark - New York). Typically reservations are not required on rail journeys, so the same charge ought not to be required. This needs to be made explicit and clarified.",,,,,,,"postmarkDate, Answer Date, Date the document was postmarked"

We employ 10 people, were established in 1986,  and sell travel to both corporate and leisure travelers.   

With respect to proposed CRS rules , these regulations, if finalized as written, will harm competition in general, and consumers in particular.  In addition, they will likely harm my business directly, since these misguided rules will let airlines control all public access to airfares, eliminating my ability to give my customers access to the best airfares and services.  The rules also prevent CRSs from providing me with financial incentives  the federal government should not interfere with my right to negotiate such assistance.

The bottom line is that, so long as airlines own or maintain control over ticket distributors like Amadeus, Worldspan and Orbitz, federal oversight is vital to preserving fair competition.  With this in mind, I strongly urge the U.S. Department of Transportation to ensure that any new CRS rules adopted include the following provisions:

§	Retain flexibility in CRS commercial agreements with travel agencies
§	Continue Mandatory Participation and extend to cover airlines maintaining marketing agreements with CRSs to ensure consumer safeguards equally apply to all airline-controlled distributors, including Orbitz; and, 
§	Apply existing and proposed CRS rules to Orbitz, which operates as a CRS today. 

In addition, I strongly support the U.S. DOTs recent proposal to extend the current CRS rules through January 2004, to allow thorough review and enable new industry programs to succeed in the marketplace.

Alitalia - Linee Aeree Italiane SPA (Alitalia) hereby respectfully submits its comments on the New Proposed Rule Making (NPRM), published in the Federal Register on November 15, 2002 on the issue concerning changes to MIDT data. 

As indicated proposed changes imply:
1. removing the travel agency identification from marketing data in the US market, unless the carrier buying the data participates in the segment
2. the carrier can request that Global Distribution Systems (GDSs) exclude their data from an MIDT product.

Alitalia is against modifying the MIDT product as presently released and strongly opposes the Departments proposal.

MIDT is a valuable source of marketing and booking information supporting the overall strategic business processes of  the Company. 
Alliances and Strategies, Strategic Marketing, Network Management and Sales departments rely on the data provided by MIDT for  analysis, forecasts and decisions. 
In order to provide top quality support to business requirements analysis and decisions,  Alitalia has invested millions of dollars for the implementation of our commercial systems which enable us to process this data and produce relevant reports.

The proposed changes will
1. massively impact on the Company commercial systems currently in use with immediate effect
2. undermine the whole business process of Strategic Marketing and Network Management  in the short and medium  term. 

Therefore Alitalia will face the loss of potential future revenue, the loss of relevant economic investments, as well as the loss of high quality information for commercial and planning activities.

Alitalia expresses its  serious concern on the negative impacts that restrictions on MIDT information has on its business and cannot perceive any benefit for the balance of competitive environment that such change is expected to establish.

In summary, Alitalia believes there is no evidence of carriers misusing MIDT data, on the contrary, this data enables carriers to improve commercial strategies and planning in order to customise services, offer better prices, increase profitability and efficiency by meeting demands of marketplace for both customers and travel agents. 
Transparency on information promotes competition and marketplace functions more efficiently when interested parties can access information about supply and demand chain. 

Alitalia strongly urges the Department to consider the heavy impacts that the proposal has on our Companys business processes with associate consequent difficulty in finding alternative solutions at an acceptable cost, giving the economic state of the airline industry.

Not only will they frustrate current attempts to reach a long-term solution to the airlines' problems, they will further encourage corporations to seek alternatives to flying.

1) The airlines maintain the proposed changes will lower distribution costs, and (by inference) airfares. Considering the financial status of the nation's carriers, this commitment to discounting travel seems unrealistic at this time.

2) Removing the regulation that that airlines must provide equal access to all fares offered on the CRS will drive up cost in three ways:
By opening the door to CRS/airfare bias
By deliberately complicating the airfare search process (driving up process time)
By virtually requiring corporations or travel agencies to subscribe to multiple CRS systems

3) The proposed changes will require the introduction of entirely new process for corporate travel departments and their agencies. The expense of retrofitting and retraining will ultimately come out of existing travel budgets.

4) The proposed changes introduce an additional annual negotiation between carriers and CRS subscribers.

5) The benefits associated with the dangled carrot of greater Web fare accessibility (long sought after by business travel managers) are offset by competitive safeguards that would now be lost under the proposed changes. 

I regret that there is no silver-lining in the CRS rule changes as proposed: not for business travelers, not for their corporations, nor for the airlines. I respectfully suggest that the Department of Transportation abandon these changes in pursuit of realistic long-term changes, with mutual benefits, that encourages business travel and a healthier economic environment for the transportation industry.

Sincerely,

Mark A. Williams
President

Our analysis, on the other hand, suggests that the intense competition in the travel agency business coupled with the emergence of system alternatives is likely to have a counter-balancing effect on any alleged market power. Given thin profit margins, large numbers of incumbents, and low barriers to entry, travel agencies remain extremely alert to any innovation that would benefit their customers.  This alertness  gives the agencies a degree of bargaining power against the systems and airlines since both need travel agencies for bookings. 

 

DOT, in revisiting these regulations, seems disposed to lifting previous encumbrances on the air travel industry, though in only a piecemeal fashion.  The ability to effectively regulate prices and contract terms¿as DOT has concluded in several places and as we have endeavored to point out above¿is at best ineffective (as industry participants innovate along non-regulated margins), and at worst counterproductive (as costs are raised and air travel is thereby made less attractive).  It may prove easier, and far less socially costly, therefore, simply to allow the CRS rules to sunset.

What these rules will also accomplish is that competition and unbiased information WILL BE ELIMINATED for the travelling public by way of their local travel agency.  DEALERSHIPS will be created with agencies supporting those airline companies that offer the best deal, while virtually eliminating the small travel agency that will not have the ability to negotiate with any airline supplier, due to their small sales.

There are changes that need to be made with the current distribution system, however, the majority of the rules that are being proposed will have a long-term, negative effect on small businesses and the ability of the travelling public to receive fair, unbiased information with respect to airline travel.

The only logical answer to the rules that are being proposed, must be NO.

I am against the proposed CRS rules change, as it will dilute the opportunity for the managed travel program to leverage policies and commitments for corporate airline discounts. In essence by not requiring the airlines to publish ALL of their pricing in one or more central databases we will have every airline hustleling their prices through their own individual applications, and there will be no way to centralize the information for fair market comparisons. Eliminating the GDS's will not help the airlines (it will even make them more reflexive on price) and will only hurt consumers and major businesses that are already gauged by airline pricing.

Please feel free to contact me directly for further comments on this issue

Our analysis, on the other hand, suggests that the intense competition in the travel agency business coupled with the emergence of system alternatives is likely to have a counter-balancing effect on any alleged market power. Given thin profit margins, large numbers of incumbents, and low barriers to entry, travel agencies remain extremely alert to any innovation that would benefit their customers.  This alertness  gives the agencies a degree of bargaining power against the systems and airlines since both need travel agencies for bookings. 

 

DOT, in revisiting these regulations, seems disposed to lifting previous encumbrances on the air travel industry, though in only a piecemeal fashion.  The ability to effectively regulate prices and contract terms¿as DOT has concluded in several places and as we have endeavored to point out above¿is at best ineffective (as industry participants innovate along non-regulated margins), and at worst counterproductive (as costs are raised and air travel is thereby made less attractive).  It may prove easier, and far less socially costly, therefore, simply to allow the CRS rules to sunset.

Alitalia - Linee Aeree Italiane SPA (Alitalia) hereby respectfully submits its comments on the New Proposed Rule Making (NPRM), published in the Federal Register on November 15, 2002 on the issue concerning changes to MIDT data. 

As indicated proposed changes imply:
1. removing the travel agency identification from marketing data in the US market, unless the carrier buying the data participates in the segment
2. the carrier can request that Global Distribution Systems (GDSs) exclude their data from an MIDT product.

Alitalia is against modifying the MIDT product as presently released and strongly opposes the Departments proposal.

MIDT is a valuable source of marketing and booking information supporting the overall strategic business processes of  the Company. 
Alliances and Strategies, Strategic Marketing, Network Management and Sales departments rely on the data provided by MIDT for  analysis, forecasts and decisions. 
In order to provide top quality support to business requirements analysis and decisions,  Alitalia has invested millions of dollars for the implementation of our commercial systems which enable us to process this data and produce relevant reports.

The proposed changes will
1. massively impact on the Company commercial systems currently in use with immediate effect
2. undermine the whole business process of Strategic Marketing and Network Management  in the short and medium  term. 

Therefore Alitalia will face the loss of potential future revenue, the loss of relevant economic investments, as well as the loss of high quality information for commercial and planning activities.

Alitalia expresses its  serious concern on the negative impacts that restrictions on MIDT information has on its business and cannot perceive any benefit for the balance of competitive environment that such change is expected to establish.

In summary, Alitalia believes there is no evidence of carriers misusing MIDT data, on the contrary, this data enables carriers to improve commercial strategies and planning in order to customise services, offer better prices, increase profitability and efficiency by meeting demands of marketplace for both customers and travel agents. 
Transparency on information promotes competition and marketplace functions more efficiently when interested parties can access information about supply and demand chain. 

Alitalia strongly urges the Department to consider the heavy impacts that the proposal has on our Companys business processes with associate consequent difficulty in finding alternative solutions at an acceptable cost, giving the economic state of the airline industry.

Our analysis, on the other hand, suggests that the intense competition in the travel agency business coupled with the emergence of system alternatives is likely to have a counter-balancing effect on any alleged market power. Given thin profit margins, large numbers of incumbents, and low barriers to entry, travel agencies remain extremely alert to any innovation that would benefit their customers.  This alertness  gives the agencies a degree of bargaining power against the systems and airlines since both need travel agencies for bookings. 

 

DOT, in revisiting these regulations, seems disposed to lifting previous encumbrances on the air travel industry, though in only a piecemeal fashion.  The ability to effectively regulate prices and contract terms¿as DOT has concluded in several places and as we have endeavored to point out above¿is at best ineffective (as industry participants innovate along non-regulated margins), and at worst counterproductive (as costs are raised and air travel is thereby made less attractive).  It may prove easier, and far less socially costly, therefore, simply to allow the CRS rules to sunset.

Alot has changed in Mercer County on this topic .... no support for Mountain Time based on last County Commissioner election.

More schools closing and consolidating with Cetral time zone schools.

It is like changing times in the spring or fall, then you move on till the next time you need to change the time. I""ve heard comments about how it will mess up dairy farmers and thier milking times. I didn't know that cows could tell time! I hope that the DOT will reconcider there decision on this matter

On a number of flights, the pilot will announce a reason for delay, only to change the story 30 minutes later.  When waiting at the gate, the gate agents announce the outbound flight was delayed only to later announce there was a mechanical issue.

While cars and trucks provide important mobility, they also pollute the air and impair public health, the environment, and our communities. Efforts to build our way out of congestion by expanding highways only leaves more of us stuck in traffic without good alternatives. 

I urge you to support transportation reforms that protect the environment, enhance public health and safety, boost transportation choice, reduce sprawl and assure better public involvement and accountability for the effects of transportation decisions. As you consider reauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), please work to: 

- Expand Protection of Air and Water Quality The federal Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Program should be increased proportionate to the growing population in areas not meeting air quality standards. Boost funding and incentives for use of best storm-water management practices and environmental impact mitigation on roads. 
- Bolster Accountability for Public Health and the Environment Assure timely attainment of new air quality standards that protect public health. Strengthen oversight of transportation and air quality planning with better accounting for the indirect impacts of road expansion on traffic, land use, and pollution. Boost incentives and funds for state and local consideration of alternative strategies to reduce traffic and pollution. 
- Support Smart Incentives such expanding incentives for employers to pay for public transit benefits, 
- Level the Playing Field between Road Building and Transit Alternatives New road projects should meet the same criteria and funding requirements as new transit projects. 
- Oppose Environmental Streamlining.  Preserve the public's role in helping to plan highway projects. Oppose bills like ""Expedite"" that would weaken environmental laws to build roads faster. Instead support better integration of transportation, land use, and natural resource planning and environmental reviews so bad projects are screened out early and good alternatives advance faster. 
These policies ensure that transportation agencies will become better stewards of our environment and communities. Thank you for your support.

We (Americans) are tired of being denied the transportation choices so readily available elsewhere in the world.  
 
I am writing to ask your support to keep Amtrak running. Amtrak needs $1.2 billion this year (should get 2.0B). And, most of all, it needs a long-term reauthorization so it can stop sliding from crisis to crisis. America deserves a first class rail passenger service. No passenger rail service in the world is profitable. It was wrong for Congress to demand that Amtrak become the only passenger railroad in the world to be self-sufficient. Amtrak already recovers more money from revenue than most other passenger railroads in the world. 
Living in an area that is serviced by the Acela Express, I can testify first hand of its benefits:  Convenient, no airport hassles, fast, provides an alternative (competition) to airlines and cars, and is environmentally efficient.  Therefore, positive externality to society greatly outweighs its cost.  However, due to the lack of funding, Amtrak has reduced the frequency of this great service to society and hasnt been able to upgrade the infrastructure in order to run this train at its maximum potential of 150 MPH; this speed was attained in Japan 35 years ago.    Ultimately, US rail travel is 30 to 40 years behind our European and Japanese economic rivals.
In addition, this kind of investment causes a unique phenomenon in the local economies it affects.  It promotes more clustered development, investment from the private sector around the high-speed infrastructure, migration and increased entrepreneurial spirit, and creates jobs for all levels of the social stratums.   In a time of economic and foreign crisis, what better way to provide redundancy to highways and airports and economic development to create jobs than to invest in rail.
Please increase your 2004 budget for Amtrak, and work with congress in a bi-partisan fashion in developing a national high-speed network of trains.  Highways and airports receive 33 billion and 17 billion respectively in subsidies {2002}, yet Amtrak is given a hard time receiving 2 billion.   Such an imbalance in subsidies provides an in-efficient market and a comparative advantage towards automobiles and airplanes.  I am a strong supporter of laissez faire economics, but I also believe in a fair and  efficient market place.  Therefore, funding for rail should be increased.  
I am very pleased with the job the US Congress has done, but leadership for an integrated multi-mode (Road, Rail, Air, & Sea) national infrastructure policy has been absent in this country for over 50 years.  The roads and airways have become increasingly congested, but our rails have been neglected.  They use a fraction of the land area roads use, pollute much less than other modes, and are much more energy efficient (Trains are energy-efficient -- Intercity (Amtrak) trains are far more efficient than airlines (2441 Btu's per passenger-mile vs. 3999 for airlines in 1998, according to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory). 
Ultimately, with so much talk about the environment, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, air quality, urban sprawl, airport and highway congestion, September 11th, sagging economy, and desperately needed redundancy in our transportation system, we cannot afford to continue neglecting such a valuable resource. The time to invest in High Speed passenger rail is now.
Thank you for all your hard work!

The purpose of this message is to outline my concerns on the imbalanaced policy in transportation. (33B Highways, 18B Airports/airliners, 6.8B Transit, Rail..NONE?  1.2B?amtrak?) There is no formal agency to invest, plan and research for rail.  In addition With such a subsidy impbalance towards cars and airliners, there isn't fair competition among all three major transportation options (GROUND).  Funding for rail MUST be increased!  WE must plan, invest, and research to a national (TGV/ICE/Shinkasen)High Speed rail network for passengers and freight.  Rail uses a fraction of the land use, energy use, pollution output, and can handle far greater frieght and passenger capacity than roads.  Please increase amtrak funding, but most of all investment into high speed rail infrastructure!

There is no lift-equipped van service in Anne Arundel County, other than in the Annapolis area, which is limited in operation to only the Annapolis area.  I live in Glen Burnie, Maryland, and at the present time, I have to use the Mobility Van Service that is operated through the MTA in Baltimore.  Although it is affordable, it is not very reliable, as I am often late getting home, and sometimes I am too early to arrive at my destiantions! I have contacted the Anne Arundel County Director of Transportation in Anne Arundal County, Diane Matland, and while she sympathized, I was informed that there wasn't enough money in the County budget to accomodate the disabled people here in Anne Arundel County with a lift-equipped van service!  I feel that this is a great disservice to the disabled community here in A.A. County, (of which, there are thousands), but I am at a loss as to what I can do.  Disabled people are always encouraged to get off the SSI payroll, and be productive citizens, but that is extremely difficult if there is no adequate and reliable transportation to allow us to accomplish this simple goal.  Thank you.  Sincerely, dmburck1959@hotmail.com

Francesconi",,,,,,"If you hold DHL to the rule that 75% of its shareholders must be US citizens, the the DOT must be prepared to hold UPS and FEDX to the same ruling.  If all three conditions must be present for a carrier to be considered a US citizen, the all three should be checked to insure their compliance to the stated 75% ownership rule.  How can a Mutli National Corporation like UPS or FEDX argue shareholder citizenship. Are they prepared to relinquish their priviledges as an airline should they fail the test of US citizenship?  I am a Transportation professional.  Believe me when I say that US companies pay to much for parcel services because of the lack of competition.  UPS and FEDX know their margins will shrink if competition is allowed to prevail, which is why they've pull out all the stops.  Pls be fair in the test of citizenship by applying it to DHL, UPS, and FEDX before you pass judgement on DHL  


For a carrier to qualify as a U.S. citizen, it must be incorporated in the United States, its president and two-thirds of its board of directors must be U.S. citizens, and at least 75 percent of its voting stock must be owned by U.S. citizens.  In addition, the department must find that the carrier is effectively controlled by U.S. citizens. ",,,,,,,"postmarkDate, Answer Date, Date the document was postmarked"

Raising the $30 or $40 million level to include the fees is the appropriate step.


In evaluating the firms participating in the DBE program, it can be seen that many are small, growing businesses. Setting the consession fee to an average (in this case 21.9%) will effectively  raise the fees that are paid by firms in 4 of the 5 catagories listed in the MPRM. It would be beneficial to all of the DBE firms to raise the size standards to accomodate the consession fee.",,,,,,,"postmarkDate, Answer Date, Date the document was postmarked"

Goetz",,,false,DOT-OST-2002-13977-0001,,,2003-01-28T05:00Z,2003-01-28T05:00Z,,,,,,,,"Comment(s)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kimberly","Goetz",,,,,,,,,,,"While I thank the Department for providing an opportunity for comment, I strongly disagree with the Departments proposal to adjust the current size standards for airport concessionaires due to the concession fees paid to airports.

Petitioners are correct in that the current size standards hamper the firms ability to retain DBE status.  However, Petitioners are incorrect that the current size standards hamper the firms ability to grow; to the contrary, that the firms gross receipts exceed the applicable size standards fully demonstrates the firms financial success.  Not only has the firm been able to grow and prosper, it has done so to an amazing extent.  A firms ability to retain DBE status despite its phenomenal success cannot, in and of itself, be justification for changing the rules to the firms further benefit.

Petitioners have argued that the imposition of uniform size standards creates a disparity between firms in different industries.  However, this argument ignores the actual financial situation of restaurants, retail outlets, and car rental agencies.  

Commissions paid to airports are simply a cost of doing business for all airport concessionaires.  Unlike food and beverage, retail, and car rental concessionaires, advertising agencies do not have other relatively high costs of doing business.  Advertising agencies have fewer employees than other concessionaires.  Advertising agencies do not need to purchase and maintain large numbers of automobiles.  Advertising agencies do not have to pay for and retain large inventories of books, sundries, foodstuffs, or related items.  The differences in commissions paid to airports actually level the playing field between different types of concessionaires by leveling their respective costs of doing business.

Petitioners argument also fails to consider the already increased size standards for airport concessionaires.  If Petitioners were applying for DBE certification as an FHWA contractor, their average annual gross receipts would be limited to just $5 million.  By establishing the $30/$40 million size standards, the Department has already recognized and accounted for the increased costs and higher revenues associated with airport operations.

While the Department (with its comprehensive view of airport concessionaires nationwide) may determine that $68.65 million in gross receipts per year reasonably constitutes a small business, the Department cannot expect either the general public nor members of Congress to understand or agree with that determination.  As the Department has not yet adopted a Personal Net Worth limitation for owners of airport concessionaires, there does not appear to be a way the Department can guarantee that DBE concessionaire owners are, in fact, socially and economically disadvantaged.  

The dramatically increase of (at least some) concessionaire size standards, combined with the lack of Personal Net Worth limitations, gives credence to DBE opponents and their arguments.  In the Departments final rule publication, the Department noted at 64 FR 5098:  The basic thrust of their argument was that if the program does not exclude wealthy members of the designated groups  meaning those who are not, in fact, disadvantaged  then it is overinclusive and therefore not narrowly tailored.  Whether or not this argument is correct is not relevant to the current NPRM.  However, it will be relevant to current and future challenges to the DBE program.

Petitioners may no longer be eligible for DBE certification, but this fact does not directly alter the establishment of participation goals.  For every firm which enjoys sufficient success to graduate from the DBE program, new participation opportunities for smaller firms are created.  While the Department should not discourage firms (such as Petitioners) from attempting to make the most of every potential business opportunity, it should likewise not discourage small firms from attempting to expand into the concessionaire market.

I encourage the Department to remember that graduated firms are still counted towards participation goals for the duration of their current contract (which could be up to ten years).  If a firm ceases to meet the DBE certification requirements, it will not be removed from any contracts and will not incur undue financial losses or penalties.

Finally, the proposed increase in size standards will further encourage large (sometimes multinational) corporations to own locations in multiple jurisdictions.  Instead of creating an environment dedicated to free and fair competition among many small firms, the increased size standard will promote the increasingly common practice of multiple DBE firms being owned by a single group of affiliates.  The Department should continue to promote competition, not monopoly-type behavior.

The Departments current size standards do not create a disparate system, but instead eliminate potential disparity in concessionaire contracting.  I strongly encourage the Department to reject the Petitioners request and to maintain its current size standard limitations for all concessionaires.

I say that it is ""surreptitious"" because the increased changes do not have to be explictly shown in the tariffs (other than perhaps a footnote). Another potentially unfair consequence of the proposed rates increase is that the increase is unevenly distributed and instead penalizes shippers with low density cargoes. If the airlines and forwarders need to increase their rates, then they should do so in the clear light of day and not try to hide it behind some arbitrary change to their volumetric weight calculation.

I've attached a link to nmfta, an organization dealing with ""National Motor Freight Classification"" which is a US trucking rate classification standard.  
When you review just the linked page you can see that the type of classification adjustment for trucking is very similar to what IATA is trying to do with CR 502.  

http://www.nmfta.org/whatisclass2.htm
 
And as you read through this rate classification it is not considered an anti-trust issue for trucking. It's only fair that the same consideration is given to air carriers. When you combine the US trucking practice, with the way I outline air-cargo rating below, you'll see it's virtually the same thing.

Please see detail below





 

 

The Justice Department has offered an opinion that IATA's request for a change the volume conversion factor is construed as an anti-trust issue. The volume issue is an adjustment to a standard conversion factor that already exists, which is outside the rate a carrier charges for the transaction.

 

At the bottom of this e-mail is a sample of an air-waybill. The key air-waybill components in question are as follows:

 

actual weight -chargeable weight - rate/charge - total 

 

The conversion factor impacts the chargeable weight only.

 

Ex: A shipment of one thousand pillows weighs 500 lbs yet takes up the volume equivalent of 4000 lbs of space on an aircraft. The adjustment of the conversion factor proposed by IATA is actually saying that based on the volume of space, these pillows take up  4680 lbs of space on the aircraft.

 

Now this is how the air-waybill would be rated following the air-waybill example below.

 

                 pieces        actual weight    chargeable weight        rate/charge     total

Carrier A   1000            500 lbs            4680lbs                        .50/per lb       $2340

Carrier B   1000            500 lbs            4680lbs                        .40/per lb       $1872

Carrier C   1000            500 lbs            4680lbs                        .30/ per lb      $1404

 

In each of these examples the actual and chargeable weight remain the same yet the per lb rates are the rates the carrier provides the freight forwarder.

 

Things the DOJ must consider:

1) In 90% of the cases it's the freight forwarder that shops around for the rate from the carrier.   

2) More than 85% of all airfreight shipments in the non-integrated cargo environment is done through an industry practice called consolidation.  Basically the forwarder will consolidate a bunch of shipments to the same destination and in doing so will try and mix some volume freight with dense car",,,,,,,"postmarkDate, Answer Date, Date the document was postmarked"

Similar issues in the trucking industry also require the occasional adjustment of commodity classification based on density, packaging, and value.

See attached link http://www.nmfta.org/whatisclass2.htm



 Since deregulation airfreight net -rates are lower now than back in 1975. Between the carrier - forwarder there are ""Net-Net¿,¿ Contract"", ""Density"" and ""Spot"" rating schemes which vary from carrier to carrier. The proposed adjustment to the conversion factor is based on changes in packaging which when looking at the illustrations attached, is clearly taking up more space on the aircraft.  The pictures were taken from 4 different carriers and of 5 different shippers and commodities. If the volume calculation is not adjusted how does the carrier re-coop the lost revenue from these shipments? They can¿t.  



The competitiveness of air-transport rating is not going to change as a result of this rule. Carriers can select to apply volume or not apply it that will not change. 



I¿ve extracted an excerpt defining the basic premise of antitrust ¿The historic goal of the antitrust laws is to protect economic freedom and opportunity by promoting competition in the marketplace. Free competition benefits consumers through lower prices, better quality, and greater choice. Competition provides businesses the opportunity to compete on price and quality, in an open market and on a level playing field, unhampered by anticompetitive restraints.¿



The key is making the playing field level for all parties concerned and as a result, the integrity of antitrust remains 100% uncompromised with the adjustment to the volume standard.

The fare is the lowest which would attract customers-but the subsidy rate is middle of the road.Continental only wants $400 K subsidy which is less than all the other proposals so far.The Great Lakes proposal's fare is the highest of all 3 which makes it the least attractive.I wish if Continental would continue to fly out of Victoria thru June(as planned) they would change the flight times on the last returning flight to the 9:30pm flight so you would have plenty of time to make all your travel connections and still get back to Victoria.As it stands,if Continental is flying with the times they have given I will have to redo tickets for my vacation June 16th.This has all been very stressful.As a regular person who works full time and plans all year for one 2 wk vacation,it is really hard to not know what you will be doing a month from now when you are leaving.We bought our tickets early thinking that would be a good thing to have confirmed tickets/plans but now it seems that we spent $1000 and don't even know anything with any degree of certainty.We have even thought several times about just canceling the tickets all together.I know this is a very long comment but I just wanted to let someone know what a average person is thinking who has been paying very close attention to all the FAA decisions(and how it affects me in the long and short term).Thanks for listening.

I have been living in the New York area for over 30 years, and she and I have been making regular trips back and forth three or four times a year all that time. Air travel into Victoria, in terms of expense, scheduling and general uncertainty, has been a problem we have learned to live with, begrudgingly. Things were just starting to get a bit better recently, when Continental Express started using larger planes, and now here we are again... I am presently trying to make reservations for a mid-June flight from LGA to VCT and it seems impossible to plan. Guess I'll have to rent a car, again, from Houston, pay outrageous inter-city drop-off fees, and deal with whether or not the Victoria Airport is even open to return the vehicle! Since I've been through this so often, my vote for a new carrier would definitely be for one that services Houston, because at least those of us who end up having to drive to Victoria because of eratic air service can do so in three hours from IAH.

is really not possible. For flights to IAH the number of passengers and the revenue will likely be equal and set by market 
conditions. Thus, in reality the subsidy cost to DOT will be almost equal regardless of which carrier is selected to fly to IAH.

SkyWest has the best chance of financial success because they will provide continuity of the connection with Continental
 in Houston. Financial success will reduce the needed DOT subsidy.

I understand Skywest managers have visited with local reps and with current ExpressJet staff. SkyWest seems intered in us.

Skywest clearly has the financial and marketing strength to eventually be profitable in this market.  Skywest will codeshare with Continental Airlines, and pending final approval, Delta Airlines and Continental will have a codeshare agreement.  

While the subsidy of Skywest is higher up front than one of the competing bids, that must be tempered by the likelihood of future profitability, and frequency of service using familiar EMB 120 aircraft may cost more up front, but that will ensure better traffic into our airport.

It is vital to the success of this airport that the selected carrier be able to feed into IAH, where Continental Airlines dominates, and Skywest wants to make good use of a seamless relationship with that carrier.  The other two proposals do not compare favorably at all with that of Skywest.

Finally, I serve as managing partner of our firm, and serve as past president of the community's annual Bach Festival.  I can assure the DOT that this community will make good use of the fine facility we have and will work to ensure profitability for Skywest, as we know subisidies are not designed for perpetuity.  We look forward to the selection of Skywest.  Thank you.

I have been flying in and out of Victoria, Texas for the past 28 years.  Many of my flights involved flying to the Eastern part of the US, and a good number of the flights also involved international travel (both business and pleasure trips).  I used to fly frequently on business, and found the EMB-120 type aircraft flying between Victoria and Houston to be reasonably fast and efficient.  The new jet service instated by Continental Express recently did not improve the flight time by a significant amount and the jet aircraft were more cramped in the seating arrangement.  I have been on many flights on the EMB-120 when only 4 or 5 seats were not filled so I believe that the smaller capacity Beech 1900 (proposed by Great Lakes) would not provide adequate service to the Victoria area.

In the last two to three years I have found that Continentals fare structure has made it significantly more expensive to fly out of Victoria.  This is significant enough that for pleasure trips (4 to 5 times a year), I have found that it is more cost effective to drive to San Antonio, pay a parking fee for a week or two and fly out of San Antonio (and usually end up going through Houston).  Since there are two people flying on these trips, Continental has lost out on 8 to 10 passenger round trips out of Victoria per year from my personal travel.

One of the benefits of having an airline connect in Houston, instead of Dallas is that when you have weather or maintenance related problems affecting the flight service between Victoria and Houston you still have the option to drive to Houston to catch a connecting flight. (Which I have done on several occasions in the past).

It was disappointing to learn that only one of the air carriers showed enough interest in providing service to Victoria to actually visit the airport here and talk with the personnel concerning providing service.  It would seem that only SkyWest is genuinely interested in doing business to service this market area.

I have reviewed the proposals listed on your web site for the three airlines that submitted proposals and also the local newspaper reports of the various meeting of the Victoria County Airport commission.  As a result of my review I support SkyWest as the carrier to provide best overall service and customer support to the Victoria area. 

Sincerely,

William J. Price

The Victoria Barge Canal links the Victoria area to the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, making the Canal a leading force in the success of this region with over 11,000 jobs and $324.2 million in personal annual income as a direct result.  
However, in order to sustain Victorias success and its ability to experience continued growth and development, it is critical that Victoria have reliable, cost effective air service to Houston.  
With that in mind, as Chairman of the Victoria County Navigation District, I strongly support Sky Wests proposal to provide this essential service to Houston through the Victoria Regional Airport.

After reviewing the Show Cause Order 2003-10-10, the following comments are submitted:

Issue 3:  Submission of data as required on Appendix A is going to be a very difficult process. The data required are not clear, i.e., Non-Scheduled passenger and freight data Inbound. BTS has not had their system on the Internet since before this order was published and there is no guidance for the completion of this appendix. Also, the exclusion of carriers that do not expect to qualify for bypass mail will skew the data as incomplete for a given market.

Issue 5:   All other qualifications for a carrier to receive bypass mail has been and is still three flights a week. For the Department to arbitrarily reduce the requirement for a 19-seat passenger Part 121 aircraft to be flown into a market once a week to qualify as a Part 121 Bush rate is unreasonable and establishes a precedence that is unwarranted.

As stated in Issue 3, the completion of Appendix A in any meaningful manner, with the instructions provided, is impossible at this time to complete by November 1, 2003. BTS does not have their website on-line concerning Alaska Data, the requirement for inbound N-Skd Pass and Freight is unclear, and the communities are assumed to be only the hubs. 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on these issues.

382.107 Defines Actual knowledge, to include ... a traffic citation for driving a CMV while under the influence of alcohol   According to the DOT trial attorney, this is because citation has credible evidence based on its presumed validity.

On that consensus, the DOT Enforcement and Compliance Officer and the DOT Trial Attorney, have determined that the company is regulated to suspend the CDL driver from safety sensitive duty and refer them for SAP evaluation and treatment, as per 40.285. 

However, the rule-maker for the DOT states The Company has no authority to act on the citation. Even if it were a DUI, the Company has no authority to suspend the driver. 

Q:What chance does the CDL driver have if the judicial system, legal pools and companies arent any more knowledgeable of CFR law than the DOTs own Compliance Officer and Trial Attorney?

According to FMCSA Regulation 382.109 is explained as Preemption of State and local laws.

Q: How does this work, when there is no judicial/hearing process on the Federal level for the State issued citation or the Company issued violation?

Just as it is possible to have a positive marijuana urine drug test from passive inhalation in extreme cases, so it is possible to reach such a dilution of urine as to meet the substituted criteria.  But in neither situation is it likely or even probable.  Just as passive inhalation is not a valid explanation for a positive marijuana, so should the extreme situation required to reach the substituted criteria for urine concentration not be used to explain the substituted urine specimen.



The DOT makes accommodation for the rare individual who might unwittingly produce a urine specimen meeting the substituted criteria by allowing such an individual to demonstrate, under the supervision of a physician, that they can physiologically produce a ¿substituted¿ urine specimen.  This seems an adequate safeguard for the very rare individual who might inadvertently provide an extremely dilute urine specimen meeting the substituted criteria while preserving the standard for the multitude of drug users who are trying to beat a positive drug test by purposefully creating a highly diluted urine specimen.

I applaude the DOT in their diligence. 
I have long thought the solution to the whole dilution issue is to make the category all the same whether the creatinine is 19 or 1. Since the test is colorimetric and even mountain dew will show up with creatinine readings, it really is a poor test for validity. 
The problem is there have been very few prospective studies looking at the relationship of creatinine and specific gravity to make any kind of reasonable assertions. Until the DOT is willing to fund such a study with thousands of samples, any assertions are going to be fraught with inaccuracies and therefore open to challenge. 
Until that day, I recommend that all samples with any creatinine less than 20 but greater than 0 be treated as dilute and require that a direct observation sample must be collected immediately. Frankly, most if not all the employers I deal with re-collect all the dilute samples anyway, so this would not be any more of a financial burden as a practical matter.    
Any sample with no creatinine would still be reported as substituted. 
Again, I applaude the DOT for continuing to open this matter to discussion.
Sincerely,

The laboratory rejected the specimen for testing.  The MRO called the certifying scientist and discovered that the specimen had the color and consistency of urine but had no detectable creatinine.  The MRO discussed this with the donor and the donor had no legitimate medical explanation for no creatinine in the specimen.  My understanding is the way the reg's are written now the MRO would ""Cancel""  the test and  notify the DER that an immediate observed collection be done.  

 

I do not believe and neither do our Medical Review Officers that a person with no know medical condition that is walking around can produce a specimen with no creatinine.  This type of specimen appears to be a substituted specimen with the correct color and consistency but it is not a human urine.  Shouldn't this be as substituted.  This is our comment for the interim final rule on substitution and adulteration.

To all parties concerned,
As a previous employee (767 Captain) of (AAI) Air Atlanta Icelandic, I am aware of their intentions with their newly formed company (AAE) Air Atlanta Europe to conduct flights into the United States.

I have 3 main points of objection for granting any exemptions to Section 40109(c) of Title 49 of the United States Code and Part 302, Subpart C of the Deparatments Economic Regulations, requesting an exemption from 49 U.S.C. Section 41301.

1. Air Atlanta Icelandic's refusal to maintain a current database in their Boeing 767 aircraft's Flight Management Computers, or FMC. On numerous occasions I brought this to the attention of their aircraft maintenance technicians and yet they continued to operate the aircraft into major European destinations such as London Heathrow, and Paris Charles de Gaulle, France, as well as occasional flights into the United States, New York JFK's Int'l airport in particular.

2. Pilot Training, Air Atlanta Icelandic contracted with numerous vendors to conduct their training. This led to a lack of continuity in their operating procedures. AAI used companies as Britannia, British Airways, JMC, and others. 

3. Allowing Air Atlanta's new creation (AAE) to operate into the United States would add a new competitor to the already troubled airline industry here in the United States.

As a Captain with first hand knowledge of Air Atlanta's way of conducting their operations. I would be apprehensive of their new entrant to the industry to be operated in the same fashion as they operate AAI at the present time.

Thank you for allowing me to comment.

Ronald Greene
Former B767 Captain for AAI, Air Atlanta Icelandic.

Air carriers proposing a substantial change in operations, ownership or mgt that may affect their citizenship status should be subject to a formal , public review of their citizenship. The circumstances should be full public hearing.  The general public is a stakeholder and should be invited to comment. It is wrong to just notify aviation companies and other special interests.  American carrier SAFETY is an important consideration. A foreign controlled airline may not be as interested in spending money to maintain safety, so that is a factor in who owns the airline.

The Truckload Carriers Assocation's petition requesting an exemption on financial reporting would greatly affect Marine Underwriters' ability to properly assess a carrier.  The financial status of a motor carrier is an important measure of the potential for bankruptcy and/or fraudulent loss exposure.  If this exemption is granted, we underwriters would lose the most fundamental piece of information essential to our analysis.  
With respect to preserving confidential business information, I don't see how facilitating insurers' awareness on a motor carrier's financial standing would contribute to ""competitive harm"".  On the contrary, the periodic reporting of the carrier's status is a great way to evaluate and prevent financial problems, therefore mitigating losses to the carrier himself as well as his insurer. Overall, if carriers no longer report their financial, insurers will be greatly hindered in their ability to write Motor Truck Cargo business.

I believe DOT is looking for public comments about the new petition as
mentioned above.
 
After reading the latest article about the petition filed by the Truckload
Carriers Association (TCA) requesting that DOT grants a general exemption
to all motor carriers of property that are required to file financial
reports with DOT's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, I feel the need to
express my comments (being an Inland Marine underwriter):
 
CHUBB & SON writes a substantial amount of Motor Truck Legal Liablity Cargo
business and for us insurance carriers, the only way we have to carefully
select the ""good"" truckers  that we want to put on our books is by getting
a CAB rating after financial reports have been analyzed by CAB.
 
If the exemption for the motor carriers to file financial reports with
DOT's bureau of transportation gets passed, we will no longer be able to
identify the truckers we want to insure - as a result, we may no longer be
able to isnure ANY truckers at all.
 
Hope this petition will not be approved.
 
Sincerely,

Motor Carrier Financial Information Reporting RequirementsRequest for Public Comments

Comments by Stephen V. Burks, Ph.D. 
Assistant Professor of Economics and Management, 
University of Minnesota, Morris.

These comments are on my own behalf.

1.  	I currently make significant use of the data submitted by trucking firms on the Form M, and have done so also with its predecessors.  For example, my doctoral dissertation in economics used Form M data, and I am currently working on an academic paper using Form M data with a colleague and a student.  I anticipate continuing to do use these data as part of my professional academic duties in the future.  
	I have also been involved in the independent collection of new industry data by academic researchers, some of which is proprietary and held confidential, and some of which is able to be made publicly available, and I am of the strong opinion that the value of what is thus collected is leveraged and enhanced for many purposes by the existence and quality of the Form M data set.  
	The Form M data provide critical resources to researchers, including myself, who are evaluating public policy questions of vital concern to the government, the industry, and the general public.  Such studies include an analysis of the impact of the recent changes in the hours of service regulations imposed on commercial vehicle operators employed by the industry, and an analysis of the effect of method of pay and level of pay on driver safety performance.  Scholars also use these data to examine the annual earnings trends in the industry, in comparison with those in the economy as a whole, in studies of wage inequality in competitive economies; the data on work time and earnings provide critical variables for analysis.  Additionally, scholars use these data to look at features of the industry that assist in the development of theoretical work within their particular disciplines (e.g. the field of industrial organization within economics), and to advance scholarly understanding of the industry, and its contribution to and role in the larger U.S economy.  

2.	I do not believe that the criteria used to evaluate whether a carrier has demonstrated whether it will suffer competitive harm by release of its financial information should be changed.  
	Trucking is a very competitive industry with relatively easy entry requirements (especially in the truckload segment of the petitioners), and modest amounts of fixed capital investment compared to truly capital-intensive industries.  Competitive advantage is necessarily transitory in such an industry, and this is exactly the desired public policy result of the industry deregulation of 1980, because it ensures that each firm is always forced to meet the competition in terms of significant innovations.  The annual reports at the level of relatively coarse financial detail required by the Form M are good, albeit lagging, indicators of overall competitive success, but they do not generally give competitors access to useful strategic information, and certainly do not generally do so in a shorter time than the normal routes of diffusion of knowledge within the industry (such as turnover of managers, sales efforts by vendors, etc.) provide.  Therefore, the petitioners argument that the BTS is failing to exercise its delegated authority to grant reporting relief is likely accurate, but incomplete, because it leaves out the fact that the BTS decisions have been appropriate and proper, given the inability of petitioners for relief to show credible evidence of harm.  
	Few privately held firms like to have their financial information in the public domain, but establishing dislike is not the same as showing that their financial growth or operational success is measurably inhibited thereby.  It is worth remembering that corporations are chartered by states in the first place because doing so serves public purposes such as economic growth and job creation.  A corporate charter imposes a burdento meet the lawful requirements of the public, such as the historically and currently important Form M reporting requirementsand being privately held does not remove this legal and moral burden.  

3.	I believe that the current reporting thresholds should be retained, with two qualifications, one major, and one minor.  
	The major point: there should be an immediate lowering of the Class III threshold, in order to require limited basic information from all firms that operate with a separate carrier identification.  This information should include the (1) name of the firm, (2) its primary business location, (3) some measure of its size, such as the average number of drivers and/or independent contractor drivers employed, or the total annual revenue, (4) a categorization of the type of freight that generates the majority of the firms revenue, and (5) an estimate of the proportion of that revenue generated under the firms own carrier identification, as opposed to revenue generated while providing purchased transportation services to another carrier.  It would greatly enhance the ability of economists to analyze the structure of the motor carrier industry to have a current basic census of all the firms that are competing.  
	The minor point: if some basic reporting is required of small carriers, then since inflation slowly changes the value of the dollar thresholds, I would regard it as reasonable to adjust what are currently defined as the Class I and Class II thresholds upward (or downward, if required by deflation) once every three or every five years, using the Producer Price Index or a more targeted variant, and making the adjustments in increments of $500,000.  If some basic reporting is not required of small carriers, then I believe the thresholds should be left where they are currently.  

4. I do not currently make use of the QFR, but I believe that its continued collection is helpful for the laudable BTS aim to make more transportation data available on a more timely basis.  

5. The DOT should not, in my opinion, eliminate any current lines items in the Form M. The current version strikes a reasonable balance between a lowered reporting burden, current usability, and the very critical factor, for assessing long term trends, of historical comparability with older versions that had more detailed reporting requirements.  

6. Not Applicable. 


As a professional academic analyst of the trucking industry (who is employed at a major public university, and who is commenting on his own behalf) I believe it would be inappropriate to grant the petitioners' request, and I state my grounds for this professinal opinion in detail.

This data is the only useful data on motor carriers that is available.  I and others use it for research in areas of safety, productivity, model efficiency, and other areas.  It is critically important that this information stream continue, especially now that there is little oversight of our most important industry.  It is important to understand that this data is used for many purposes that do not involve motor carriers directly.  Projects for capacity improvements in truck, rail, and other modes depend on accurate cost information that this data stream provides.

Additionally, since the report was streamlined, the report is significantly less onerous than it used to be.  What is it that some carriers want to hide?  Without this data we wouldn't have a clue.

Motor Carrier Financial Information Reporting RequirementsRequest for Public Comments

Comments by Michael H. Belzer, Ph.D. Associate Professor of Industrial Relations
Wayne State University

These comments are on my own behalf.


Over the years I have used Financial and Operating Statistics (""Form M"") in my research many times.  I used Form M data in my doctoral dissertation on wage determination in the trucking industry after deregulation.  I used these data from the regulated period and from subsequent periods.  More recently, I led teams of researchers studying both truck driver hours of service and the relationship between truck driver pay and safety for the FMCSA.  We used these data at various during this research for both primary and secondary purposes.  That is, we used them both to test hypotheses and to verify other data sets we were using.  Most recently, I have been working with colleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on truck safety research which, in part, uses these data.

These data are unusual insofar as they provide detailed insight into firms using public highways.  Just as driving is a privilege and not a right, we confer this privilege to motor carriers to use our highways as their business location.  They must in turn disclose more information on many aspects of their business operations in return for using these highways, and the data provided in Form M is part of that exchange.

I retain the only existing set of paper Form M dating from the end of the Interstate Commerce Commission back to approximately 1970, which is the entire history of the modern trucking industry in data form.  The BTS should be encouraged and funded to make these data also available to other researchers, as I have had to bear the cost of maintaining these files privately for many years.  If they were available, researchers could expand the state of knowledge of historical trends in this industry and resolve many other questions of historical interest that require financial and operating data.

Frankly, I would argue that the current F & OS data should include a number of additional items that could help researchers better understand the connections between trucking company finances and operations and truck safety.  This is a growing area of interest as scholars and others search for alternative means of benchmarking motor carrier safety.

I do not believe that the criteria used to evaluate whether a carrier has demonstrated whether it will suffer competitive harm by 
release of its financial information should be changed.  We have debaded this issue repeatedly and at great length and no showing of competive harm has been demonstrated.

I believe that the current reporting thresholds should be extended, as data on Class III carrires should be required to a much lower threshold.  These data can be linked to MCMIS data and others, allowing a more robust analysis of the relationship between financial and operating characteristics and motor carrier safety.

Indeed, I served on the National Research Council/Transportation Research Board panel providing oversight to FMCSA's Large Truck Crash Causation Study.  I recommended that the FMCSA and its contractors make a stronger effort to capture F&OS type data in that study and surveyors found it very difficult or impossible to collect it on carriers that had suffered crashes.  If these data were available on a larger number of firms, this research might have been more feasible.

I do not currently make use of the QFR.  

The DOT should not eliminate any current lines items in Form M. Indeed, the public would be well served by more data reporting, not less.
