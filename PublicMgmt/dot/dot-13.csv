I will present this in two phases, first why the decision should be reversed and secondly what caused Miles City to be considered for termination.
1. Miles City has only one reliable commerical transportation into and out of the city. Our present commerical bus has been suspended by DOT.  If we were to lose EAS that would mean no reliable tranmsportation.
2. There are many Disabled Veterans who need hospital care in Denver or SLC.  If we lose EAS they have no transportation for these well deserving veterans, same goes for the elderly .
3. 7 months out of the year we have the possibility of winter conditions which makes it a saety hazard driving to Billings
4. Loss of EAS would dampen our econmic development in the future with coal and oil just starting to expand.
Wht caused the problem for Miles City
1. We have 3 outgoing flights two to Billings and one to Glendive.  The one to Glendive no one would ever ride. If this was not considered as outgoing we might make the requirement.
2. there are no compatible flights out of Miles City to connect with other carriers, resulting in less people to fly as they would have to stay overnight in one of the connecting hubs which increases the cost.
3. If the numbers were looked at in 2011 we had approximately 1094 outgoing passengers, The first year this other carrier took over we droped to slightly over 324 riders.  What casued this, we all are intelligent enough to look at the numbers, outgoing flight times and connecting flight times to determine why Miles City numbers have dropped.
4. The decision should not be based on one year by a different carrier, but based on years past performance with all carriers involved

I strongly request that Miles City be given a chance to show with compatible flights good connection times at the correct hub we would be successful
You must do whats right for Montana our area is to large to compare with any other areas.",,,,,,,

We are a new agriculture business that is very pleased to call Hobson, MT home. We specialize in feeding and finishing cattle that are shipped out of state for slaughter. Much of the immediate segment of our industry is located outside Montana. Myself and 3 other local individuals participate in business travel that requires reaching a major, and occasionally an international, travel hub in Denver or Minneapolis. 

A direct route to one of these hubs will greatly enhance our business interaction with the industry beyond Montana borders. It will also allow business associates and potential investors/customers a much more efficient, thus more frequent, connection with our local operation. 

Please consider that a direct route to Denver is most desirable and should increase annual traffic on the Lewistown, MT route by approximately 20%. 

Best Regards,

Jim Fryer",,,,,,,

Many ""travel agents,"" ""VIP concierge providers,"" hotel concierge services and similar third party planners, even ground transportation providers, ""broker"" charter flights regularly. What constitutes an “air charter broker”? How would regulations account for current air charter brokers to simply change their name to “travel agent.”  Some small charter brokerages broker only a single flight per week, or even per month, while large “travel agencies” may broker charter flights significantly more. Attempts to regulate “air charter brokers” would have unintended consequences as inevitably companies may find ways to creatively exclude themselves from regulations while still conducting the same services, putting regulated charter brokerages at disadvantage. Further, air charter brokers have, in the past, not complied with existing regulation - I don’t understand how increasing regulations will help solve the problem of air charter brokers that don’t comply. Let’s focus on getting everyone to comply with existing regulation first! In addition, foreign entities broker charter flights in the US everyday and go completely under the radar, putting US brokers at disadvantage. How would an operator know that the person they are selling the charter to was not associated with the passenger group and how will you regulate this?

If the government has approved a part 135 carrier to operate charter service, the burden of “vetting” or safety is on the government and the operator and no one else. While third party charter ratings are good indicators of charter operators’ commitment to safety, they should have nothing to do with regulation. These are completely optional programs that are designed to enhance safety and help spread use of best management practices and communicate to customers, including brokers, that they are committed to safety. If there is going to be any improvements in industry safety, they must be focused on enhancing regulations and programs for the Part 135 operator, not the person that hires the part 135 operator. To say otherwise is to discredit the part 135 certificate holder and government regulations surrounding the granting of a part 135. If regulating the air charter brokers screening process for subcontracted operators, what would be required beyond obtaining the part 135 certificate and perhaps an optional copy of the insurance policy?

Proposals that the air charter broker should be in a “binding contract” prior to presenting the proposed contract to their client is absurd. A binding contract for most oneway flights is non-refundable.

Market forces should regulate air charter brokers. While the Internet has, in the past, increased opportunity for unscrupulous air charter brokers to deceive clients -- similar to every other industry that was effected by a transition to internet marketing -- the Internet of the future will put checks and balances in place that will make clear to a consumer if the brokerage is reputable via online reviews and social reinforcement. Further, market forces should guide all pricing and nothing but taxes should be required to be disclosed to the end client. If the end client wants line item pricing, they can search around for a charter operator or broker willing to provide that. Attempts to regulate pricing are nonsensical in a free market as the broker’s ability to increase margin by negotiating or leveraging discounted pricing should be afforded to the broker and not required to demonstrate to their client of a higher than expected margin.

Air charter brokers should be strictly required to disclose they are a broker and not an air carrier. Deceptive marketing that gives the impression a brokerage is an air carrier should be strictly enforced. Even under current regulations no government official has ever contacted my to discuss this… efforts to better educate brokers would be more beneficial. If a client requests information about the operator they will be on or to be added as an additionally insured on the insurance policy, regulations could help promote disclosure after the contract has been signed and the client is in a cancellation policy window, because there are many clients that would regularly utilize a broker to source a carrier and deceptively cancel with the broker and go direct to the carrier-air charter brokers should not be required to put themselves in a losing scenario. Regulation should be focused on the part 135 certificate and certificated carrier.

Aeromexico has been unresponsive to my complaint. I contacted DOT and I just got an email that says that my complaint does not touch on any regulations enforced by this office and that they can't help me.

So what type of regulations are enforced by DOT?  And If DOT can't help me, could you please point me in the right direction as to which federal agency will enforce the following.  These should be requirements to improve the air travel environment for consumers.
- Providing passenger with the proper documentation for a flight
- Treating passengers with respect (not throwing them out of a terminal, escorted by security?)
- Not separating minors from parents, exposing them to abuse

I expect that protecting passengers is the right thing to do. It’s just that simple. And will expect that DOT will continue to create and enforce rules that protect my rights before, during and after flights.",,,,,,,

The majority of puppy farms in this country are run by British people and they are all disgusting. NEVER buy a puppy from a pet shop, from anyone who is not KC registered and even then insist on seeing the puppy with its mother. Check out how they interact as it may not really be the mother. Ask to see around the whole of the breeding place so you can see how the parents are kept. Many breeding stock suffer terrible diseases through the conditions they are kept in.

 I am writing to express my opposition to the proposed “accommodation” to the HHS mandate. I do so for the following reasons: 

The so-called “accommodation” does NOT expand the number of non-profits that can opt out of the mandate. Nor does it remove employers from the business of providing morally objectionable health coverage to their employees. What’s more, the revised mandate does not even pretend to offer any “compromise” to private businesses. The alternatives for business owners who do not wish to violate their consciences or religious beliefs are: Pay crushing fines ... or shut down your business. Finally, there are still no provisions to allow individual employees to opt out of the morally objectionable coverage that their employers are forced to provide.

 For all these reasons I believe the revised HHS mandate be scrapped entirely.",,,,,,,

E-cigs bother no one, harm no one and, in fact, help the smokers get through a flight and, in all likelihood, reduces the number of smokers immediately outside the doors of airports (who are FAR more likely to harm those standing around as well as themselves with their smoke).

Besides the very legitimate 'freedom' and 'rights' issues inherent in such a proposed ban, all common sense seems to be abandoned with a ban on e-cigs. E-cigs are HELPING both smokers and the public at large! Only reason I can see for banning these devices and/or restricting their use is to protect the pharma companies or tobacco companies...which doesn't seem like a good idea to me or anyone else I know for that matter).

Equating the vapor exhaled by an e-cigarette smoker to that of a regular cigarette is completely wrong. Regular cigarette smoke contain nicotine and many other chemicals and by-products, and has indeed proven harmful (althought the harm of second hand smoke has not been proven and has been called into question). e-cigarette ""smoke"" is water vapor, with very minimal amounts of nicotine if any at all.

e-cigarettes have in a recent study been shown to have no effect on cardiac microcirculation in the smoker, and therefore second-hand vapor is also very, very safe. All well-designed studies to date have proven the benefits and lack of harm from well made e-cigarettes. Those articles that express harm are either poorly designed studies or are pure nonsense (recent French ""60 Millions de consommateurs"").

As a Pediatrician I discourage cigarette smoking but, if asked about e-cigerettes, I tell people that they, as far as any legitimate studies are concerned, have been shown to be much safer.

E-cigarettes should NOT be banned on commercial flights, especially long distance flights. I have had fellow passengers tell me that they drink more BECAUSE they can not smoke.

If other passengers are paranoid about e-cigarettes then it should be explained to them that they are NOT inhaling second hand cigarette smoke and that the DOT has found the e-cigarettes to be safe and to allow their use.

They often have to go quite a long distance to find a relief area just to have to go back through security and checkpoints to get back to their gates in an airport. In addition, it puts stress on the owners, as they often worry excessively about missing their flight. This can be dangerous for people with Severe Anxiety disorders, and some other disabilities as well.

In this, I believe I can provide a viable suggestion.

Often, a big factor in relief areas for assistance dogs is time. the time it takes to get to the relief area and back is usually long, and forces the handler and his/her dog to go through security multiple times. In regard to this, would it not be a viable option to place assistance dog relief areas next to the restrooms in airports? Instead of having just a women's and Men's restroom, add a third room as the Assistance Dog Relief area. this would make relief areas easy to find, and close to any gate since a restroom usually is not too far from any gate. When it comes to security, it would be easy to install a few cameras in such a room, and then your security issues are solved. Since handlers will carry supplies to clean up after their animals, you can install a trashcan so that the room will stay relatively clean. The janitorial staff will most likely want to clean the foors well every 2-3 days, and trash will be taken out daily.By placing the relief areas with the common restrooms, it also solves the problem of how to determine the number of relief areas, as the number of relief areas would equal the number of bathrooms. I don't have much to say on materials, but the size of the relief area shouldn't have to be any larger than a 25' X 25' space. granted, this is just my opinion, but there in all likelyhood should not be more than one or two handlers using the room simultaneously at any given time. 

 On maps of the airport, you can mark the restrooms as usual, and in the key mention that the mark for restrooms also indicates the relief areas for the assistance animals. This makes them easy to locate and ensures that passengers should not miss their flights. 

This is the extent of my comment. I hope it helps with your decision, because some type of action needs to be taken.",,,,,,,

As an Audiologist and advocate for individuals with hearing loss, I believe The Department should require all U.S. airports to provide access to messages and pages broadcast from the PA system in a manner that is accessible to individuals with varying degrees of hearing loss.  It is imperative that all individuals with hearing loss have equal access to auditory information.  Due to the complicated nature of hearing loss, which affects the quantity of hearing (i.e. degree of hearing loss) and/or quality of hearing (i.e. clarity), one system is not suitable to meet the needs of all individuals considered under this proposal.  A dual system with visual display and an induction (hearing) loop is the most appropriate solution.  The induction (hearing) loop system would allow individuals who utilize hearing devices such as hearing instruments and cochlear implants to gain access to auditory information wirelessly via a T coil program and a visual system would provide access to individuals whose hearing loss results in poor speech recognition ability.  An example of a successful induction (hearing) loop can be seen in the Grand Rapids, Michigan International Airport.

Furthermore, it is imperative that access to all messages, essential (alerts, emergencies) and basic information (flight delays, gate assignments etc.) be made available in a manner that is suitable for varying degrees of hearing loss.  Not providing access to all auditory information is inappropriate and inconsistent with the definition of accessibility.  Additionally, it would be prudent to require these proposed changes of U.S. and foreign carriers for consistency for all travelers here and abroad.

Ford Airport Expands Hearing Loop System

Gerald R. Ford International Airport officials have announced the expansion of the hearing loop system installation at the airport. This system enables individuals with telecoil (T-coil)-equipped hearing devices to have public address system announcements transmitted directly to their hearing aids. This assistive listening service is available on both airport concourses, at all airline gates and holdroom areas, and now in the airport’s Grand Hall.

“We are delighted to offer this service to our customers who use assistive hearing devices,” said acting executive director Phil Johnson. “By the direct transmission of gate and flight announcements to T-coil-equipped hearing aids, this hearing loop system significantly enhances the airport experience for the thousands of our customers who have experienced hearing loss. And now, this service is available in more areas of the passenger terminal building.”

Additional information about hearing loop systems is available at www.hearingloop.org.

Encouraging access for those with hearing loss via hearing loops will have more impact than providing access for those with physical or visual challenges.  Also, keep in mind that babyboomers such as myself consitute the population segment that has the most disposable income and are most inclined to travel by air.  In addition, hearing loss is on an upswing because conditions that we are living with (cardiac disease, diabetes, and kidney problems) in conjunction with treatment plans that extend life expectancy (including chemotherapy, loop diuretics, and aminoglycoside antibiotics) CAUSE hearing loss.

Due to the aging baby boomers the total number of individuals living with hearing loss is expected to increase. In over 90% of the time the hearing loss that is experienced is sensorineural which affects not only audibility but intelligibility or understanding speech.  Due to this type of hearing loss, notoriously airport poor acoustics and fast speaking airline personnel, for these millions of people with hearing loss who use hearing aids and 250,000 cochlear implants, deciphering the announcements at our nation airports and airport gates is nearly impossible.  The provision of induction hearing loop technology would greatly enhance the ability of hearing device users to directly hear the announcements wirelessly in their hearing instruments which greatly enhances their understanding and speech discrimination. Hearing loop technology is a worldwide universal technology that, installed to the international installation IEC standard, will not only provide hearing access for the hard of hearing US citizenry but will also be used by millions of visitors – such as my Dutch mother – who have to navigate our increasingly busy airports while trying to understand announcements in a foreign language.",,,,,,,

Due to the complicated nature of hearing loss, which affects the quantity of hearing (i.e. degrees of hearing loss) and/or quality of hearing (i.e. clarity, one system is not suitable to meet the needs of all individuals considered under this proposal.  A dual system with visual display and an induction

The induction (hearing) loop system would allow individuals who utilize hearing devices such as hearing instruments and cochlear implants to gain access to auditory information wirelessly via a T coil program and a visual system would provide access to individuals whose hearing loss results in poor speech recognition ability.  An example of a successful induction (hearing) loop can bee seen in the Grand Rapids Michigan International Airport.  Furthermore, it is imperative that access to all messages, essential (alerts, emergencies) and basic information (flight delays, gate assignments, etc.) be made available in a manner that is suitable for varying degress of hearing loss.  Not providing access to all auditory information is inappropriate and inconsistent with the definition of accessibility.  Additionally, it would be prudent to require these proposed changes of U.S. and foreign carriers for consistency for all travelers here and abroad.  
Most of the U.K. and other European Countries are looped.

This situation could be addressed for the majority of hearing aid wearers like myself if airports and airlines were required to install hearing loops such as those in the Grand Rapids, MI airport to include very prominent and suitable signage that would display the international symbol for hearing access alerting us to the presence of such loops.  This would allow us to turn off the mics in our hearing aids that are amplifying all of the noise while turning on the telecoils to hear only the voice broadcasting the announcement..

This is a huge problem in Airports and all types of transportation facilities.  I am a person with relatively good hearing. I recently had a layover in major airport. While walking from one concourse to another to catch my connection, I focussed on the overhead paging system alerting me of all types of general messages and airline information.  The problem is that after almost a 1/2 an hour of walking, I never understood a single message!  I can only imagine how difficult this could be for one of the 36 million Americans (and rapidly growing) with hearing loss.  An even greater concern, these paging systems are the primary source for Emergeny Notification! 

As a communications contractor for over 35 years, I have been involved in the installation of paging systems in many airports and transportation facilities.  Not until we installed Hearing Loop technology in our local airport did I find a solution to Hearing Loss and communications in transportaion facilities (Airports).  Since then we have looped two additional Airports and are having conversations with several more.  This technology works, and it is growing throughout the US.  The A.D.A recognizes 3 forms of hearing assistance in public facilities (somehow airports get an exemption) Infrared systems, Radio frequency system, and Inductive loop system.  Of these 3, the Inductive loop is the only workable solution for Airports, as it is the only system that connects directly to a travelers personal hearing device (Hearing aid) nothing else is required.

  Based on my experiance in Airport communications systems and the installation of inductive loops, the combination of loop systems and visual messaging displays provides the best solution for communicating to ind\ivuals who suffer with loss of hearing and/or visual impairments.  Travelers with Hearing loss is growing as the general population ages.",,,,,,,

An induction loop is probably the best way for an HOH person to hear what is being said as the sound is fed directly into the hearing instrument w/o intereference from background noise.  The only other way to provide better communication for an HOH person would be by captioning.  A loop can accommodate a number of people as does captioning, but a loop is much less expensive to operate, can be in place all the time, and the induction loop itself is not a great expense.  Loops can be used in small areas as well as large areas.  While captioning is great, the field of vision to see the screen whatever type it might be is limited and is of no benefit to someone who is blind.  A loop can accommodate the blind who are HOH much better than captioning.  Please do not summarily dismiss the idea of using induction loops at airports as they can be a most valuable assistive system to provide access to people who are HOH.",,,,,,,

Since day one (almost 40 years ago) it was obvious that not all clients could understand speech from even the most expertly designed sound system in an extremely reverberant or excessively noisy environment. People with more advanced hearing loss needed a separate system.  I have installed every kind of assistive listening system on the market (IR, FM, inductive loop and visual displays).

This January I attended a three day work shop on speech intelligibility sponsored by Syn-Aud-Con and taught by preeminent experts in the field.  

Because I misread AM and PM on my plane ticket I had the dubious pleasure of listening to PA announcements in the Gate C area of the DFW airport for over twelve hours as well as on the AA flight home.

The vast majority of announcements (all routine) were barely intelligible  for a non-hearing impaired person in all areas and for a variety of different reasons.  A hearing impaired (anyone with a hearing aid) had no chance of understanding any announcement made anywhere or anytime in the course of that day.  Ironically DFW is one of the more involved airports and actually send representatives to the workshop.

I had many hours to contemplate both the problem and possible solutions.  There really are just two solutions and I believe they both must be employed.  Not doing so puts this and every airport in clear violation of the ADA and risks the safety of thousands of people.

Airlines and airports must deploy inductive loop systems and visual displays in all gate areas at a minimum.  Ideally they would cover much more.

My loss is not identical to anyone else’s hearing loss, and for that reason, there is no one system that will provide the needs of all people with hearing loss. There is a need to have both a visual display, and a listening system for those people who use hearing devices such as hearing aids and cochlear implants, who have a telecoil program. An appropriate listening system that would not require additional equipment would be an induction (hearing) loop. One airport that currently successfully uses an induction (hearing) loop is the Grand Rapids, Michigan International Airport.
Furthermore, it is imperative that access to all messages, essential (alerts, emergencies) and basic information (flight delays, gate assignments etc.) be made available in a manner that is suitable for varying degrees of hearing loss.  Not providing access to all auditory information is inappropriate and inconsistent with the definition of accessibility.  Additionally, it would be prudent to require these proposed changes of U.S. and foreign carriers for consistency for all travelers here and abroad.

Hearing aids have limitations with the microphones. Normal hearing people have trouble hearing the announcements in the airport. The hearing impaired find it impossible. With the loop installed, they would be able to hear the announcements right in their ears, taking out that distance from the speakers to the microphones of their hearing aids.

Airport induction loops would allow those with hearing loss to receive announcements directly in their hearing aids, bypassing the background noise that can render these critical announcements completely inaudible.Patrons of airports in Michigan as well as international airports, like Heathrow in London, have already experienced the incredible benefits of hearing loops, but airport looping should not stop there. The rising number of people with hearing loss means that more and more people who patronize airports will require ADA mandated accommodations to be able to hear and properly in the airport environments. Now is the ideal time to install induction hearing loops in airports across the country to serve the increasing population of those with hearing loss. 

In our Indianapolis audiology practice, we have installed a hearing loop in our waiting room, and have hosted several consumer education events to advocate for their installation, because we truly believe that they are the best way for those with hearing loss to receive the mandatory equal access they deserve. Many types of venues can benefit from installing hearing loops- from churches to taxicabs. Airports, however, have a special need for hearing loops. When a person has hearing aids, the amount of ambient noise created in airports leads to muddled sounds and missed information. A person should not have to accept sub-par access to information and sound because of a hearing loss in any environment, period. We urge all airports to recognize that those with hearing loss deserve equal access by installing induction hearing loop systems as soon as possible.

The risk for people who are hard of hearing like me or deaf is that you will fail to understand announcements though the standard sound systems (e.g. change of gate, delay of flight, emergency notification etc.) or through face-to-face speech (e.g.,  meal choices, check-in questions or instructions, TSA announcement or instructions).  
At least two factors are involved in this problem for everyone: poor quality sound systems and background noise in airports and airplanes, both of which make it difficult for people with “normal” hearing to understand speech.  These problems are magnified for me and others who are hard of hearing or deaf, not only because my hearing deficit is profound but because even with the current level of sophistication in hearing aids and cochlear implants that amplify filter and focus speech, along with amplification of speech, background noise is also amplified.  The result is that these noises still mask or fully drown-out the speech you need to hear.  
There are two ways that speech information in airports and airplanes can be made to accommodate us.  One is by a loop system, the other is by captions.  For example, loops at ticket counters and gates would increase our understanding of announcements and instructions and at gates providing captions along with loops would go further to increase understanding.  Similarly, having announcements and instructions by TSA personnel who are interacting with passengers fed into a loop system would allow much better understanding on our part and avoid misunderstandings on their part.  Airplane cabins should looped as well so that attendants’ and pilots’ announcements are understood by us.  
These recommendations are not just made to make airline transportation pleasant for us—they are directly related to our safety.

This fact is extremely stressful to me and causes my travel experience to become challenging. I do use the reader boards. I often travel with a 'normal hearing' person so that I know what is going on. But this limits my ability to be independent. 

I use induction loop technology everyday. I have it connected to my television set. One of the aspects of my business, Hard of Hearing and Deaf Services, is to hook up loop technology for people. I also teach them how to use their T or telecoils in our hearing aids that allows us to pick up the signal sent by the induction loop. For people that don't have T coil enabled hearing aids there are receivers and headsets a person can wear to hear the signal. This is wonderful technology and I would not be able to enjoy music or television without it. It also allows me to be able to hear on a cell phone.

Induction loop technology is 75 years old. More and more people are becoming Hard of Hearing as the Baby Boomers age and there will be greater demand for this technology. It is my understanding that many airports in Europe already have this technology set up. It would be wonderful to have it here in the United States. It would ease our ability to travel and hear important information. It would also help to have emergency information relayed over the loop system. Flashing lights to let us know there is an emergency and to tune into the loop system would allow us to be able to hear instructions that could save our lives. ",,,,,,,

All of the information that is available to ""normal"" people is inaccessible to me unless it is in visual form (warning lights), writing (captioned), or transmitted directly to my hearing aids (a loop system).

Another issue is training personnel to understand that hearing loss is not visible and many people do not want tell the world they have this disability. Hearing loss is usually not the first thing that comes to mind when a person appears confused. There are several ways to make interactions easier that could be included in ""sensitivity training"" programs.

The induction (hearing) loop system would allow individuals who utilize hearing devices such as hearing instruments and cochlear implants to gain access to auditory information wirelessly via a T coil program and a visual system would provide access to individuals whose hearing loss results in poor speech recognition ability.  An example of a successful induction (hearing) loop can be seen in the Grand Rapids, Michigan International Airport, the South Bend Airport and the Kalamazoo Airport.
  It is imperative that access to all messages, essential (alerts, emergencies) and basic information (flight delays, gate assignments etc.) be made available in a manner that is suitable for varying degrees of hearing loss.  Not providing access to all auditory information is inappropriate and inconsistent with the definition of accessibility.  Additionally, it would be prudent to require these proposed changes of U.S. and foreign carriers for consistency for all travelers here and abroad.
Airports are difficult for normal hearing people to hear and understand but it is nearly impossible for those with hearing loss.

I am not hearing-impaired but can only imagine what it must be like. These proposed accommodations seem to me to be a no-brainer. It amazes me that with the state of the art equipment we have in the US airports, we are failing to provide the most basic services to what is, unfortunately, a growing segment of our population.

We need these folks to be able to have access to the same information as any other traveler. Until these changes are made, we are discriminating against every hearing-impaired person who enters our airports.

Without exception, research shows that hearing aid users have a poor to useless experience with their hearing aids using their internal microphone(s) in such an environment. Hearing aids can work very well in intimate, acoustically dry - non reverberant spaces, or outdoors in one-to-one situations.  The moment one is immersed in a noisy or reverberant space, the onboard microphones can become worse than no hearing aid at all.  Unless of course, they have T-Coils equipped devices and there is an AFILS- audio frequency induction loop system properly installed and operating to accepted standards.  Suddenly announcements and appropriately mic'd counter staff can be heard and understood. Confusion and discomfort in an already stressful situation are thus considerably reduced and a person needing the assistance and involvement of special and additional personnel is obviated.   In the long term, by filling these needs with an installed loop system, personnel costs for an airport facility are reduced and the intended goal of providing a comfortable and pleasant user experience is achieved. Without good and effective AFILS  - Hearing Loops, we will not reach these goals in our airports!  Europe does a considerably better job than the USA in providing these valuable services.

Deaf passengers are unable to hear any boarding, gate change, or other announcements. Hard-of-hearing passengers have problems hearing and/or understanding the announcements due to the background noise, or gate agents who talk too fast on the P.A. system or have accents which make it difficult for HoH passengers to understand.

Therefore there needs to be a multi-faceted approach to helping both populations.

A real-time captioning system with a display at each gate position, and displays around the terminal could be considered. There could be system where all announcements are typed in and voiced by a high-quality text-to-voice system and at the same time displayed on sign-boards, or, there could be a real-time captioning system similar to TV or telephone captioning where captions are transcribed by an operator (to overcome the accent/speed problem) and displayed on sign boards. There should be some type of notification like a strobe light to announce attention to any new message.

In addition, audio-loops could be installed at gate positions to help HoH passengers who don't especially need the captioning, but need to be able to hear the announcements while being able to tune out the general noise in the terminal.

As a HoH individual, I find it extremely difficult to hear general terminal and gate announcements and have had to resort to asking strangers to repeat announcements for me. Deaf/HoH pasengers should be given the same opportunity to receive important information as hearing people.",,,,,,,

These loops help all of us with t-coils in our hearing devices (both hearing aids and cochleasr implants) to hear sound directly in our ears, with all of the external airport noises eliminated. Airports in Northern Europe, Scandinavia and even Russia have such loops.  Why not here? ",,,,,,,

I must depend on others around me to help 'listen' for the announcements.  The announcements are usually dIfficult to understand even to those WITH good hearing!  It would help immensely if the Department  requires all U.S. airports to provide access to messages and pages broadcast from the PA system in a manner that is accessible to individuals with varying degrees of hearing loss.  It is imperative that all individuals with hearing loss have equal access to auditory information.  
A dual system with visual display and an induction 'hearing' loop is the most appropriate solution.  The induction 'hearing' loop system would allow individuals who utilize hearing devices such as hearing instruments and cochlear implants to gain access to auditory information wirelessly via a T-coil program and a visual system would provide access to individuals whose hearing loss results in poor speech recognition ability.  An example of a successful induction (hearing) loop can be seen in the Grand Rapids, Michigan International Airport.  The New York City subway system was installing the 'hearing loop.'   Great decision!
Additionally, it would be prudent to require these proposed changes of U.S. and foreign carriers for consistency for all travelers here and abroad.

Installation of induction loop systems around ticket counters and passenger gate areas is a simple solution that would benefit innumerable hearing aid users passing through U.S. airport terminals.  
Although I have normal hearing, I have listened to speech over  a microphone in a reverberant environment with my ears alone and then through a telecoil-equipped hearing aid.  The improvement in clarity due to the signal-to-noise ratio increase is astounding.  For hearing-impaired persons who typically can tolerate less noise than normal-hearing individuals, the improvement is that much more critical.  
Approximately 70% of hearing aids distributed in the U.S. currently have telecoils within them that allow receipt of crystal-clear induction loop signals with a simple press of a button, while temporarily eliminating background noise, echo, and reverberation.  Once installed, induction loops require minimal to no maintenance, and would provide equal access and immeasurable benefit to hearing impaired travelers passing through U.S. airport terminals.

I am profoundly deaf, but am blessed with cochlear implants. In my view, without doubt the most efficient and effective service for the deaf is the hearing loop, which, once installed, needs no extra technology from the presenter or the listener. Just connect the loop to the loud speaker and we deaf can tune in by flicking our personal technology, whether hearing aid or implant, to its t-switch (telephone switch). 

Why is it that the Europeans are so very far ahead of us Americans in using this technology? For a deaf person, it is like having someone standing beside you....so easy to hear, and with no interference from airport noises.

As a person who has auditory acuity, I am always frustrated when I travel by flight because of lack of access to effective communication. Starting from booking,  transit within the airport, boarding, in flight announcements, arrival, to baggage claim, people without auditory hearing acuity have access to effective communication while the communication access needs of those with auditory acuity are ignored. It is estimated that more than 10 percent of population in the United States have some degree of auditory acuity, and their communication access needs are not addressed by the airport services.

I suggest that the FAA should strive to make all airports communication accessible by integrating auditory and visual communication technology with the current communication systems. Hard of hearing people who depend mostly on using their residual hearing by using cochlear implants and hearing aids equipped with telecoil switches will benefit from hearing induction loop system. More than 70 percent of hearing aids and 100 percent of cochlear implants manufactured in the United States are compatible with hearing induction loop system. In Europe such as United Kingdom, most of the major airports have induction loop systems.
For people who are deaf with several to profound hearing acuity will benefit from visual communication technology such as smartphone applications that utilize text format in real-time captioning, and LED Scrolling message boards. Smartphone applications will be more ideal because all people either with or without auditory acuity can login at various applications to obtain information in text format.
Therefore, FAA should require all airports in the United States to address the communication access needs of all people.
Thank you!

I am also a frequent flier with progressive severe-profound hearing loss and have worn hearing aids since I was 19. 

While raising a family, I traveled alone, cross country, several times a year with my two young daughters. I frequently missed gate change announcements, and had to rely on my daughters to do the listening for me. 

Recently, I traveled to Ireland/England and discovered hearing loops at the airports, the train stations, the tour bus, the pharmacy counters, the museums and the auditoriums!  Simply by pushing a button on my hearing aid, I was able to clearly understand. In my carry-on bag, I normally travel with an arsenal of assistive listening devices; after 3 days in Dublin, I realized they weren’t needed. I could leave them in the suitcase and lighten my load. 

Hearing loss is an invisible disability, that impacts daily communication for me and 1 in every 5 Americans—1 in 3 at age 65. Hearing Loss is a significant public health issue; the World Health Organization warns hearing loss will be the most prevalent disability in the future, yet little is being done to create a hearing accessible world. 

I am advocating for accessibly designed airports. These would have: 
-Universal Hearing Access Signage—apparent as soon as you walk through the doors.
-Barrier free hearing loops and signage at each check-in desk and other points where critical information is exchanged
-Gates & Airport Terminals would be designed with hearing loops so travelers who wear hearing aids or CI’s can understand announcements.
-Hearing loops would be installed to meet the IEC60118-4 standards,

Accessibility makes a trip easier and more enjoyable for people who experience limitations in vision, hearing mobility or memory.

In that time I have worked with hundreds of individuals whose hearing loss isolates them from many activities and services available to individuals with normal hearing.  As someone who travels frequently, I can attest that airport acoustics are dreadful.  Announcements are broadcast that are distorted, in echoing rooms, produced by less-than-clear speakers; and where even normal hearing travelers turn to each other to ask what was said. Hearing-impaired travelers simply cannot hear these - and they represent a significant portion of the US public.  Putting aside for a moment the necessity of hearing when one's flight is leaving, what about safety?  I have been in airports when announcements were made about severe storms or tornadoes and a need to move immediately away from windows; and where there has been a security issue and important and unexpected announcements are made. Travel should NOT be in the category of activities that are restricted because of hearing loss.  At least one simple solution exists: loops in airports.  I urge you to implement these as quickly as possible.  ",,,,,,,

Induction loops are cost-effective technology that transmit the sound from the loudspeaker directly to the hearing aid or cochlear implant user’s ear via magnetic signals. Most hearing aids and cochlear implant processors may access the loop with the ""flick of a switch"" at any time, and the system can accommodate an unlimited number of users simultaneously.  It is a timely, cost-effective means of providing improved communication to thousands of hearing impaired individuals passing through  airports and other public areas.

Hearing loops are powerful because they REALLY DO eliminate background noise and help the signal the person wants to hear (airport announcements) come through clearly via their hearing aids and/or cochlear implants.  

Hearing Loops are a proven technology that is relatively inexpensive that can make a profound difference in the lives of those with hearing loss.  A majority of hearing aids sold in the US are equipped with telecoils and can pick up sounds from a hearing loop.  Sadly, hearing loops are not universally available to the public, and many people do not even know about them or how powerful they are at improving hearing.   Our nation is far behind Europe and other developed countries in providing accessibility and public awareness for hearing loops.  If every airport was looped, people with hearing loss would have much less anxiety about traveling by air, because they wouldn't have to worry any more about missing a flight or a gate change because they couldn't hear the announcement.

Hearing aids alone are not enough in an airport because the acoustics in an airport are notoriously bad.  Airports are large, often with high ceilings, a lot of reverberation, and a lot of sound competing for our attention.  A person using the hearing loop can set their hearing aid so that it ONLY picks up the sound from the loop, thus ensuring that they can clearly hear all the announcements coming through the loop.  PLEASE provide this funding to install hearing loops.  It is a matter of important public health and creating accessibility for all in a public space.",,,,,,,

  At SFO, I was given pat down because of CI. I wear loose pants because of a pinched nerve in my hip.  Explained to the security guard.  He was not listening.  Told me to remove suspenders, then did rub down of legs.  Pants went to ankle, in front of 120 onlookers.  (It was San Francisco ..  my son says they are used to naked people so it was no big deal.)

That could be done with ""looping"" the airports, having captioning on the monitors, captioning boarding info so I know when my section is called (or even the person at the gate holding up a sign for the current section).

I have missed being paged by my parents to know where to meet them, missed boarding calls, have difficulty heariing at the ticket counters, transportation counters - anywhere there is anything spoken.  

I feel like a foreign traveler right in my own country's airports because I can't hear or understand what I'm hearing.  

It's time to address the needs of the deaf and hearing impaired.  There are all kinds of things for the blind and those in wheelchairs.  It's time to address this population that has been overlooked. Please help make airports accessible FOR ALL.

Hearing announcements in airports is often difficult for people with normal hearing, with hearing loss it frequently becomes impossible.  Installation of loop systems would greatly enhance the travel experience for individuals who wear hearing aids equipped with a t-coil.  Visual communication systems would aid deaf clients as well as those who are hard of hearing but do not have hearing aids with t-coils.  They would also be beneficial to normal hearing individuals who cannot always make out overhead announcement as well. 
The normal stress of traveling is compounded when you are fearful that you may miss an announcement about a gate change      or worse yet, an emergency announcement.  Appropriate accommodations could make a great difference to those of us who require them.  ",,,,,,,

I am now personally dealing with my own hearing loss.  During recent instances of travel, I have experienced difficulty understanding announcements at airports across the country. I believe The Department should require all U.S. airports to provide access to messages and pages broadcast from the PA system in a manner that is accessible to individuals with varying degrees of hearing loss.  It is imperative that all individuals with hearing loss have equal access to auditory information.  Due to the complicated nature of hearing loss, which affects the quantity of hearing (i.e. degree of hearing loss) and/or quality of hearing (i.e. clarity), one system is not suitable to meet the needs of all individuals considered under this proposal.  A dual system with visual display and an induction (hearing) loop is the most appropriate solution.  The induction (hearing) loop system would allow individuals who utilize hearing devices such as hearing instruments and cochlear implants to gain access to auditory information wirelessly via a T coil program and a visual system would provide access to individuals whose hearing loss results in poor speech recognition ability.  An example of a successful induction (hearing) loop can be seen in the Grand Rapids, Michigan International Airport.
 
Furthermore, it is imperative that access to all messages, essential (alerts, emergencies) and basic information (flight delays, gate assignments etc.) be made available in a manner that is suitable for varying degrees of hearing loss.  Not providing access to all auditory information is inappropriate and inconsistent with the definition of accessibility.  Additionally, it would be prudent to require these proposed changes of U.S. and foreign carriers for consistency for all travelers here and abroad.

This simple system allows an unlimited number of hearing aid wearers to act independently and hear overhead announcements with ease.

1.  Audioloops
2.  Visual information at the gates to indicate whether the plane is on time and when it is boarding, and any delays and reasons for delays.
3.  Allow deaf and hard-of-hearing people to highlight the lines for their flights by allowing the text to be larger and in a different color and yet easily readable.
4.  Larger signs for restrooms and for wi-fi tables and wi-fi areas.
5.  Encouraging deaf and hard-of-hearing people to board with  elderly people and people of various disabilities.
6.  Assigning escorts for hard-of-hearing and deaf people who need additional information about their flights and luggage to help them navigate around the airport.
7.  Training of airline personnel and airport personnel about people of various disabilities with simple handouts for different kinds of disabilities and have that training once a year - basic training then refresher courses.

Deaf and hard-of-hearing people fly just like blind people and people with mobility handicaps.  Please make the airports more accessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing people.",,,,,,,

As an audiologist, I see a number of patients who despite using hearing aids, struggle with hearing in noisy situations, such as airports, restaurants, ticket counters etc..   These individuals lead active lifestyles and feel isolated, frustrated, and fatigued when spending hours struggling to hear.   Induction loop technology, commonly  available in public locations across Europe, allows the hearing aid user to utilize his/her own hearing aids  to directly receive the audio signal via a magnetic field.  The use of induction loops at ticket booths, information counters, in transportation systems, on the concourse will transmit announcements from the agent or PA system directly to an individual's hearing aids, without all the background noise.   Informational or emergency messages can be easily heard enhancing communication and safety.  Induction loop technology is an inexpensive way to address the needs of those with hearing loss in public venues and should be avaialable in airports across the US.   ",,,,,,,

If the type of facility is consistent at all airports, it would be possible to train one's dog to use this before traveling.  Perfectly housetrained animals cannot be expected to suddenly eliminate inside, which is exactly what they may have been trained not to do.

This is SO important for service dogs and their humans.  Since we (the team) have to be at the airport as much as 2 hours before a domestic flight, it means we can't relieve our dogs for at least that time plus the length of the flight plus travel time to & from the airports(s).  That means our dogs are having to hold their business for many many hours.  Not only is that uncomfortable for the dogs, it is unhealthy.  As my service dog's human, if I can't let him relieve himself prior to boarding, I worry that he'll have an accident somewhere - embarrassing for both of us - and an inconvenience as well.  My dog has a larger bladder than I do & my first stop after deplaning is the bathroom!!  There is a limit to being able to ""hold it.""  Regarding the location of these relief areas.  Please make them convenient for the human to get to as well as the dog.  (I.e., not in some remote corner of a parking lot).  If we have to go back through security after using the relief area, that just adds much more time & inconvenience to the trip.

By withholding complete pricing information, airlines make it difficult if not impossible for me to comparison shop and make informed purchase decisions.

I recently clicked on a site that was advertising a really low fare and then after making all my selections but before I made my purchase, the fare had jumped to well beyond what I thought I would have to pay due to all the hidden fees!

In an open market, airlines have the right to charge whatever prices they want — but they also have a responsibility to give me complete price information before I purchase my ticket.

Please put an end to hidden fees and make sure consumers like me can compare and buy air travel based on the true total price wherever airlines choose to sell their services.

We consistently spend more on air travel because of hidden fees.  There are fees for baggage, fees to get a earphone to see the movie, fees for a snack, etc.  This type of fee charging makes it impossible to compare air fares at the time of purchase.

We have been charged hidden fees to check in our baggage many times.  Recently, with one airline the website said there would not be a charge but then when we arrived at the counter they told us we did not read the fine print and that we would be charged.  

In another instance, I missed my flight because an agent representing American Airlines at the security entrance would not let me enter the security area because I had two carry-on bags.  I had no choice but to check the bag at the ticket counter and then wait in the Airport an additional 8.5 hours and take the red eye flight.  The TSA supervisor told me they don't care how many bags I bring through security.  This was American's way of recovering an additional $25 from me.

i recently purchased a United Transatlantic flight.  I purchased coach ticket thru my corporate travel agency but wanted an extra leg room seat. I had to go to united's website to purchase the seat.  When i had a change in return date, i had to rework my ticket purchase on my own.  It was two separate workstreams for 1 trip.  The airline didn't give me a good sense that my extra room seat was credited back when i changed the return.  I went online, i called the airline.  But eventually just had to wait until my credit card bill came thru to be sure i was fairly treated.  It's just too complex for me to manage.  Make it simple please.

As someone who has worked in this industry
for over 35 years and witnessed many,many,many changes,
the new fees for every little thing are probably the most
deceiving of all for the traveling public.  While we live in a
world of hidden ""fees"" or ""costs"", thank you Wal-Mar....and
most likely those fees are here to stay....it should still be
possible for agents like myself to be able to handle the
entire transaction for each passenger at the time of sale.
And that is not the case anymore.  For most airlines once
I process their tickets, I must then go to each airline website
and access the reservation to be able to get seat assignments,
and then of course is when they find out if they must pay
more for a designated seat.  I handle mostly corporate travel,
so most of my travelers have high level status with their
carrier of choice, making it a little easier to get their seats.
However, even for them, even when a seat is free of charge,
I still  must do this on their website, not in my GDS system.
I now spend double the time per transaction that I did even just
a year ago.  That is a problem.  And then for the leisure traveler, to try to find the best rate, maybe purchase a ticket
several months in advance, and be given a seat assignment in
the last row of the aircraft...well, that just doesn't seem right.
So, there are many ways to look at this situation, but offereing
everything upfront to the seller...would at least eliminate some
of the problems tha occur after purchase.",,,,,,,

Flying on Spirit Airlines and other carriers is stressful beause when you arrive at the aiport you discover that the baggage fees, preferred seats, meals, headsets, etc.are additional costs not always clearly advised when purchasing online or over the phone. This means great monetary and time inconvenience and it is NOT fair to the customer who keeps ALL airlines in business!!!

In an open market, airlines have the right to charge whatever prices they want — but they also have a responsibility to give me complete price information before I purchase my ticket.

Please put an end to hidden fees and make sure consumers like me can compare and buy air travel based on the true total price wherever airlines choose to sell their services.

During my last vacations, we found a very good deal on the airline site, I was so happy, finally after 2 year I was going to meet my family. When I get to the airline counter, to my surprise I had to pay for my only baggage. I didn't expect it, and really made me very upset.  I end up paying, but after doing the math, I could flight in a different airline, for a better overall price, if only the baggage charges were available since the begining.

The airlines make it difficult if not impossible for my company to transparently show all of the purchasing options to our partner clients so they can make informed purchase decisions.

In my experience, I don't deal as much with hidden fees as I do inconsistent fees and inclusions in the rate. The domestic carriers are all over the board on cost of bags (carry-on, and checked), assigned seats, refreshments, priority boarding, preferred seats on the plane. This is getting out of hand and air travel is quickly becoming an industry that caters only to those with money who don't mind being nickel and dimed!

Every other day I run into a situation with a client where I have to explain in 3-4 steps the various fees they will be charged up to the point of travel. They are shocked that their fare didn't allow for an assigned seat, and in the cases it does- the free seats are in the middle and in the last 10 rows on the plane. They should be shocked! Or in the case of Allegiant Airlines; each step in the booking process reveals more fees, and you can't see them all until you have progressed through literally 7-8 pages of the booking process until you get to the final p[rice at the end. Then you input the credit card number for payment, and the next screen gives you a different total, sometimes $16 higher! (That depends on the type of payment entered). If all of that isn't painful enough, a passenger shows up on the day of travel and finds out they will be paying (cash only) for a drink of water or snack on the flights as well.

In an open market, airlines have the right to charge whatever prices they want — but they also have a responsibility to give complete price information before the purchase of a ticket. And if they have integrity and a genuine concern for their customers and the agents that guide them along (like Southwest Airlines!) then the process is simple and transparent.

Please put an end to this type of deceit and make traveling a little more enjoyable in every step of the process.

Thanks for listening : )

The small travel Agencies like ours have been destroyed when our TA Commissions (revenue stream) have been eliminated by Airlines and Airlines told us to charge service fee separate from the ticket.  This provided windfall to ARC, GDS’s, Credit Card companies as they have started a new income stream lines.  ARC created TASF if the customer charges to CC and ARC will charge membership fee + 3.5% fee and pay the TA after 2 Weeks.  GDS-SABRE started Separate account and started charging monthly and 3.5 % charge fee if we use their service.  If we do not use their service SABRE threatened us that they would not provide GDS service.  When we send the ticket to customers they did not understand why Ticket Price is lower than what we have quoted and quit using our service.   When National Commission to Ensure Consumer Information and Choice in the Airline Industry (NECICAI) recommended providing space on the ticket to show Travel Agent Service Fee, we had some hope we could survive.  But ARC in cooperation with GDS, AL’s and their lobbyists in Washington destroyed this hope as they want to collect fee on our meager service fee charges that no customer would pay if we disclose.  Anyone with common sense can see it is not survivable as a Travel Agent in this environment because no passenger will pay service fee when he can book the same flights on the AL web and get the same fare and sometimes even cheaper.  Airlines are paying hefty commission to mega websites; sometimes these websites are owned by the Airlines.  We hope some authority in Travel Business cares and listens to our misery and provides us an opportunity to survive.

I find it more stressful than ever to try and fly with my family!  We travel to the UK twice a year.. I don't even know my seats until the day before, when I may or may not sit next to my kids  (my youngest would FREAK OUT if she was not with a parent!) This creates worry from the moment I book the seats until we fly.  Unnecessary and truly disgusting way of clawing a few more dollars out passengers.  Please make this stop!!

At least with baggage fees you could argue that it is causing people to pack less.. and therefore achieve something..!?

The extra fee to book a seat is just a blatant shameful way of charging extra money for nothing.. while adding uncertainty and stress for no reason other than profit!

I travel to South East Asia frequently on business and travel by a particular airlines, because of their reasonable price, high quality of service, cleanliness and punctuality. This airline allowed me to change my travel plans (if I needed to which happens on most of my trips) at no cost. Being a self employed professional, I like to pay the most reasonable air fare. In the last 24 months I switched to a different upcoming airline for a change. When I had to change my travel plans because of my client's request, I had to pay almost the original cost of the airfare. This came as a big shock and surprise. This is when I became aware that not all airlines are open about the hidden secrets of their air fare strutures.

Consumers are already warned multiple times about any and all fees when they make a purchase decision with a travel provider.

These consumers VOLUNTARILY opt in to purchase decisions with full knowledge of the fee structure. They then claim ignorance of the very same fees they were required to agree to as part of their contract with the travel provider. 

You read about the fee structure and you agree to the fee structure as a condition of purchase, prior to purchase. If you VOLUNTARILY indulge in a service with a fee, you pay the fee. If you don't require the service, you don't pay the fee, allowing you, the consumer, to control your costs and tailor your travel experience to your needs and your budget.

Consumers do not need further government protection from their own choices, especially if this so called 'protection' forces a cost-concious consumer to subsidize the costs of services they do not desire so that other consumers may indulge in them.",,,,,,,

I feel that this Proposed Rule is extremely important and Beneficial to individuals with disabilities. This week, our legal issues course is actually studying the Americans with Disabilities Act and equal protection. I believe that as a country, our progress towards creating more fair treatment towards individuals with disabilities will strengthen our society. 

Also, as a frequent air traveler back and forth from Indianapolis to Los Angeles, I have been on many flights with disabled individuals and have seen what it takes for the airlines to accompany their needs. Even though these airlines must take extra steps to cater to the needs of these individuals, I feel that the steps that they must take are not extreme, but are humane and show compassion. I believe that restricting people in flying due to disabilities, shows that as a country we are not willing to work together and accompany the needs of someone who involuntarily is in a certain situation, ultimately showing that as a country we cannot work towards a greater good. 

Though my points are more based on compassion and care, rather than legal based, I feel that these arguments are valid and should be weighed equally to legal based arguments.     ",,,,,,,

- While the need to revise the PNW is needed, making it too complicated may have an adverse effect on our small DBE firms who do not have the resources to properly complete it. 

- Agree with when an owner’s AGI meets or exceeds $1 million over three years should lose their presumption of economical disadvantage. 

- A spouse of an eligible applicant should file a PNW and all assets and liabilities should count towards the assessment of the applicant’s PNW. It is common for married couples to share assets and liabilities and therefore should be considered. 

-Suggest consideration to exclude the spouse's PNW if a married couple filed personal tax returns as married filing separately.

-Consider removing the “ownership interest” adjustment of the PNW, or at the very least limit it to $250,000.00. A number of DBE firms are owned by individuals who exceed the $1.32 million in personal net worth, however, they continue to remain eligible after deducting the value of the business. In a number of instances, the value of ownership interests reduce the PNW to zero or a negative number. This does not accurately reflect an eligible owner’s economic disadvantage.

- Recommend not requiring the use of NAICS codes in the bid submission process. Regulations require recipients to certify firms on the specific type of work a DBE can control. NAICS codes are often too broad and lead bidders to believe a DBE is certified in more areas then they are. One example - under NAICS 237310 - Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction, guardrail installation is included.  DBE Firm A is certified to only install guardrail.  Using NAICS 237310 would lead one to believe DBE Firm A could build highways, streets, and bridges. 

- Recommend provisions that would allow recipients to impose similar remedies on DBE firms who continually or intentionally fail to perform and cause a Prime contractor to miss its commitment/DBE participation goal. While monetary sanctions may not be feasible, temporary suspension of certification, decertification, and/or debarment action depending on the severity of the issue should be considered.

This burden is exasperated exponentially when a DBE firm is certified in more than one state.  Even though the actual form is one single form (supposed to same for all states), each state has its own idiosyncrasies and additional requirements and submitting schedules.

Submitting personal information several places at several times in a year is not only cumbersome, expensive, but risky as the personal information is exposed more than it should be.  It is risky particularly in the context of today's rampant problem of identity theft.  DBE's should not be forced to go through this.

I would strongly recommend that any DBE related information that the applicant submits should be submitted into one national level repository which states would have access to.  This will help DBE firms those who are certified in more than their home state.  This will also save a lot of tax payers dollars at State and Federal level.  Similarly, this information can be submitted only within a fixed period of time, such as certification anniversary month or so to avoid repetition and redundancy in submitting it different times to each state which currently depends upon when a firm's renewal date comes up for each state.

Another suggestion is to have an ability to submit all application information electronically on Federal DOT site where one can incrementally save his/her work as sometimes it takes long time to fill out everything in one sitting.",,,,,,,

I understood this to mean that if the prime contractor fails to make good faith efforts to meet their committed DBE participation for a project, the recipient could recover the difference between the committed amount for DBEs and the actual payments made to DBEs, in aggregate. This provision should also apply to a contractor who terminates or unilaterally reduces the scope of work of a DBE firm without good cause and/or without prior written approval from the recipient. The prime contractor could then be held responsible to repay to the recipient any difference between the committed amount and the amount the DBE subcontractor was prohibited from performing through no fault of its own.

Re: Disadvantaged Business Enterprise: Program Implementation Modifications
       DOT Docket ID Number OST-2012-0147
Gentlemen:
      Blythe Construction, Inc. is one of the largest highway and bridge builders in the State of North Carolina and we support the DBE Programs established here in North Carolina. It has come to our attention that one proposed modification to the DBE NPRM involves the required submittal of a Good Faith Effort with the Bid.  From a Contractor’s view point and perspective, we would like to present some reasons and facts why we think this would be difficult to achieve. 
1.	Bid submittals for NCDOT Proposal’s are generally due by 2:00 PM the day of the Bid. We receive quotes and evaluate quotes up until bid time; however, we typically have made our selection of subs and suppliers by 12:00 noon. We enter our Bid pricing first and then our DBE commitments. Until those commitments are entered, we are not 100% sure if we have obtained the goal or not. We typically select DBE subs in selected categories based on type of work that historically generate DBE participation. Sometimes the DBE is not chosen based on price, past performance, or other relative criteria. If our initial analysis indicates we are not meeting the goal, we first look at the DBE quote categories not selected. We then determine if it was based on price, how much more will we add to our bid and what percent of impact that has. The DBE could be 40% higher than a non-DBE sub, but the monetary difference is only 0.10% to our total bid. We would probably use the DBE quote at this point to achieve the goal. We call this “buying DBE dollars”. We have to evaluate if paying more for the same work will impact the outcome of our Bid versus our competition. We then look at categories of work we typically self perform for which we received DBE quotes to assess if this is worthy of consideration. One has to be mindful that only the low bidder is required to submit a Good Faith Effort if they fail to achieve the DBE Goal. It takes time to make the proper evaluation.
2.	We have prepared Good Faith Efforts to be submitted with a Bid. It is generally in generic format and only provides a brief explanation as to why some DBE quotes were not utilized. There is just not enough time to adequately prepare certain Good Faith Effort responses in an hour or two. We typically expend 2 to 4 hours preparing a Good Faith Effort, not including the ten copies that have to be made. NCDOT requires a response to all 9 and sometimes 10 points of a Good Faith Effort. Additionally they require an itemized comparison of each class of work for which a 
Subcontractor was utilized. This comparison and a detailed explanation as to why a DBE quote was not utilized takes about 2 to 3 hours to prepare. We do not enter into the Bidding process with the mindset that we will not achieve the Project DBE Goal.
3.	North Carolina and many other States use the services of Bid Express and their software (Expedite) for electronic Bid submittals and DBE Committal Sheets. Any Good Faith Effort submittal data would have to be attached to the EBS. Bid File. I am not sure this can be done; however, if possible, it would require a great deal of effort. Copies of quotes for evaluation and comparison purposes probably cannot be attached. Any addition to this existing electronic bidding software would be cumbersome at best. 
   Blythe typically meets or exceeds the Contract DBE goal. Sometimes the goals set are too lofty and cannot be met. DOT is not inclined to defend the basis for the percentage goal set, but they do require us to defend why we did not achieve their goal. Sometimes the anticipated participation of DBE Firms does not happen or due to various reasons they do not quote the total scope of work available. To require a Contractor to submit a Good Faith Effort with their Bid will probably result in Contractors requiring all quotes to be received by 4:00 PM the day prior to the Bid date. Any quote received beyond that time and date will not be considered. Many DBE Firms do their quote preparation the night before or the morning of the Bid date. Requiring a Good Faith Effort with the Bid will place an undue burden on both the DBE Firms and the Prime Contractor. It may result in a Prime Contractor using all DBE quotes possible to achieve the Goal, regardless of price or past experience. Then default the sub at a later date after Contract award. Allowing 6 days for submittal of a Good Faith Effort has worked well for the past 20 years. There is no sound or valid reason to change the current procedure that is in place.

2. What are the specific, quantifiable costs and benefits associated with requiring certified DBEs to submit additional documents with the annual no change affidavit from the perspective of a certifying entity and a certified DBE? 


It costs the DBE's more in terms of time and effort to submit additional documents that are unnecessary. The goal should be 
to try to seek ways to streamline the process and decrease the amount of paperwork for DBE's. Our businesses are struggling 
as it is and to impose more regulations such as ""additional documents"" doesn't make sense. ",,,,,,,

We are a general contractor who has been in business for about 35 years, and perform about $35 million per year of DOT highway work for the Alaska DOT/PF.  We have been fully involved in all variations of the DBE program since inception.  The quantifiable costs we foresee to be associated with good faith effort documentation when bids are due are substantial as it is very likely that the chosen subcontractor on bid day may not truly be low.  We see no benefit associated with this change, and in fact, the potential for harm to be greater.

Things can be hectic during the final few hours of bid day.  Some subcontractors will withhold their bids until the last possible moment to minimize the effect of unscrupulous prime bidders shopping their number.  It can be difficult during this frenzy at times to determine who is truly low due to varying scopes of work, specific inclusions and exclusions, and we will then focus on getting the right amount of dollars in the prime bid, and worry about who is really low if we are successful.  We currently mitigate that by requiring bids to be submitted one hour prior to the scheduled opening.  Requiring that prime bidders and potentially  sub-tier bidders disclose this information at the time of bid will require that prime bidders will require a longer window, perhaps up to the day before, to permit enough time to adequately compile the information.  This will add several hundred dollars to each prime bidder's cost of bid preparation.  This could also add hundreds of thousands dollars to a prime contractors bid should the wrong subcontractor be chosen.  This could also add more time for unscrupulous bidders to shop bids as the opportunity to shop is wide open before the bid but narrows considerably after the bid period as everyone's numbers are then known and it is much more difficult for a prime bidder to shop bids without getting found out by the subcontracting community, who then will ""blackball"" the bid shopper.

We currently have tools in place to mitigate bid shopping for all subcontractors, both DBE as well as non-DBE.  We have five working days to submit our subcontractor list, which then gets cast in stone.  We have at times needed all of this time to adequately determine what combination provides the least cost.  In our organization, we provide transparent documentation at the conclusion to protect our good standing with our subcontractors.

If the objective of the DBE program is to correct past wrongs against disadvantaged individuals, whether perceived or real, wouldn't improved employment training and hiring goals be more effective to reach more of these individuals?  ""Sham"" DBE subcontractors are frequently in the news.  Even if the DBE subcontractor is for real, the only real benefactor is that individual and his or her offspring.  The employees collecting wages on the project are generally non-disadvantaged, and can at times be the same workers who would be working for the successful bidder on the project, regardless of whether it was a DBE or non-DBE subcontractor.  Get rid of the DBE program and put more effort into putting those to work that need it most.",,,,,,,

In fact, we were recently named a ""DBE Champion"" by our local state DOT. Many of the firms that assist us have provided high quality service, some have not.  While I sustain the idea of supporting small business, I find the DBE program to be deeply offensive to our nation's ideas of freedom and equality.  Locally, our DBE oriented government contracts are referred to as either ""race-neutral"" or ""race-conscious"".  These labels are simply fancy political speech for 'non-racist' and 'racist' contracts. Our nation of equality should not be supporting racist government contracts.  

We use DBE firms not because of the nature of their owners' birth but because of the nature of their professional character.  This ought be the underlying principle our nation should be supporting. It is in keeping with some of the highest ideals our nation offers.  The continued promotion of the DBE program presupposes that all firms that are not minority or women owned are inherently racist and bigoted.  This is deeply offensive. 

If we truly honor those who have sacrificed much, even all, to see freedom and equality become available to all Americans, then we should honor what Dr. Martin Luther King said when he hoped that we would not judge each other, ""by the color of their skin but by the content of their character"".   I encourage our federal government to do so by ending its DBE programs.  ",,,,,,,

We like the changes to the form because it was more detailed and gives more opportunity to ensure fairness is given with the DBE Certification process and to help exclude firms that truly do not qualify even though the PNW is in line that is not, in reality, socially or economically disadvantaged.

We agree that a spouse of an applicant owner should have to file a PNW statement. We feel it is worth the burden of reviewing the volume of material that would be required in order to protect the integrity of the program. The spouses financial situation should trigger further consideration of their net worth.

Concerning the Application Form -  we are not in favor of the ""one stop shop"" method for interstate certification. Therefore, we do not agree with the proposed changes to this form.

DBE Commitments/Awards and Payment Reporting Form - we solidly acknowledge the concerns relating to the Uniform Report of DBE Commitments/Awards and Payments Form. We also concurr with the proposed changes to the report. We feel it will better capture complete information. We would like to look at the 3 to 5 year grouping method to give us an average of the overall goal but we like the year to year to show actual payments made to the DBE. We feel that the report should capture information for federal projects that have both started and completed within that federal fiscal year.

Regarding what rules govern business size determinations -  we feel it should not increase because in the past several years, we have not had any firm exceed the existing SBA size standards. So we do not feel it needs to be increased.

Concerning determinations of ownership - we concurr with the proposed changes because it allows better safeguards and allows us to check the information with further research. It will provide another tool to identify socially or disadvantaged owner.

Concerning determinations concerning control - we support the proposed changes. We feel it will allow opportunity to tighten determinations based on control of the firm.

Regarding rules affecting certification - based on the current regulation, we do not require an applicant firm to be prequalified as a condition for certification. We only require a heavy highway construction contractor to be prequalified to bid as a prime contractor on primary contracts $1.5M or greater. This is not a basis for DBE certification. We do not feel there is an issue in deleting this part of the statement.

In regard to making certification decisions - we concurr with interviewing key personnel as part of making a certification decision. 

In regard to denials of initial request for certification - we strongly disagree with changing the length of time for re-applying. We strongly want to keep the 12 month period.",,,,,,,

26.87 - recipient use to remove a DBE's eligibility - we agree with the proposed revised paragraph  that would permit a recipient to decertify a firm on the basis that its certification was clearly erroneous and the two additional grounds for decertifiction. 

26.5 - Definitions - we are fine with the proposed changes.

26.21 - Who must have a DBE program - we are fine with the proposed changes.

26.45 - how do recipients setting overall goals - we disagree with this proposal, we feel that the prequal list and bidders list should be included because it also identifies potential ready, willing and able contractors. We feel by removing these lists as part of setting our overall goal would not benefit. Instead the proposed rule should continue to include these lists as part of setting the overall goal because of excluding just in the same way potential ready, willing and able contractors.. 

26.51 -  - we agree with this proposed change.

26.53 - we agree with the bidder providing the recipient with information showing that each DBE signed up by the bidder is certified in the NAICS code(s). 

We do NOT agree with allowing the apparent successful bidder to take several days or weeks to submit DBE information. However, in case of a design build project, this method would be beneficial to this type of project. 

We AGREE that copies of each DBE and non DBE subcontractor quote would be received in situations they had picked a non DBE to do work that a DBE had sought.

We do not agree with the proposed to have the prime contractor to have to supply a good faith effort to this extent when replacing a DBE

We do NOT agree with that good faith efforts should apply to DBE's on contracts that did not have a contract goal. A zero goal means zero. Any DBE utilized would be race neutral.

26.55 - We do NOT agree with a DBE using their own employees and lease trucks from a non-DBE truck leasing company. This opens up a door in which the DBE firm would only have to own one truck and could go through a temp agency to hire employees that have CDL licenses. This takes away opportunities for other DBE trucking companies to be involved.

26.109 - WE DEFINITELY agree that this conflict of interest proposal is very much needed. We agree with adding provisions concerning ethics and conflicts of interest.

Pleasant","PA","15666","United States","Gulisek Construction, LLC","Clayton J. Stahl, P.E., President",,,,,"I am writing to you on behalf of Gulisek Construction, LLC.   As a contractor involved in transportation construction projects funded by the US Department of Transportation (DOT), my company is gravely concerned about the proposed changes to the DOT`s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program (Docket No. OST-2012-0147).  We believe that the proposed regulations will create significant administrative burdens to both the contractors and the state DOT agencies which will result in higher compliance costs. 
Our major concern is that these proposed changes do not consider the challenges contractors face when competing in a low-bid procurement system.  Our specific concerns are outlined as follows. 
LISTING DBE’s AND SUMMARY OF SUBCONTRACT WITH BID
The proposed requirement that prime contractors provide with their bids a list of DBEs that will be utilized on the project, including details about price and scope of work, is unreasonable and we believe will actually result in less DBE participation. 
The nature of the low bid process allows the prime contractor sufficient leeway to maintain its flexibility in executing subcontracts and selecting subcontractors (both DBE and non-DBE) for a project. Typically, the subcontractors submit their bids only a few hours before the prime contractor's bid must be submitted to the DOT. These bids are faxed and possibly discussed briefly over the phone and the prime contractor must hurriedly compile its own bid. This period of time is hectic and the tasks to be completed are complex. Thus, the bidding process puts the subcontractor and the prime contractor in a very different position as to the content of the subcontract. The subcontractors have the ""luxury"" of preparing their bids on their own timetable, subject only to the deadline for submitting their bids to the prime contractors. The primes, on the other hand, are dealing with all of the various construction aspects of the project and with numerous potential subcontractors. They compile their bids within a few hours of the deadline for submission, and specifics are necessarily given less than thorough consideration and are often left for future negotiations.  
Currently, DBE and non-DBE subcontractors negotiate a fair and balanced formal contract in a good faith manner even after the bid. If your proposed standards are implemented, DBE contractors would be absolved of the ability to negotiate based on the low bidder’s confidential construction methods that may have won the job.  These methods may include a creative plan that the prime contractor will use to build the project at a lower cost. These methods are not disclosed with the subcontractors who are simultaneously communicating with all of the other prime contractors competing for the same project.  Keep in mind that these creative techniques most likely will impact many aspects of the subcontractor’s initial scope.  This ‘locking in’ of the DBE’s at the time of bid will eliminate the mutual acceptance, or “meeting of the minds” component, which is integral to establishing a legal contract.
Furthermore, denying the prime contractors the time to evaluate DBE subcontractors’ quotes post-bid will lead primes to reject all incomplete or potentially inaccurate quotes and to just focus on only meeting the minimum DBE contract goal.  Often times, the time spent on going back to mutually clarify quotes leads to increased DBE participation, which is an opportunity that will be lost if these proposed changes are implemented.  This will inevitably lead to the opposite intent of the DBE program, which is less DBE utilization.  It is for these many reasons that we strongly oppose the listing of DBE’s and the summary of the subcontracts with the bid.  
GOOD FAITH EFFORTS
Equally troubling is the proposed requirement that primes who are unable to meet DBE contract goals must submit their good faith efforts documentation with the bid.  Providing good faith effort documentation at the time of the bid, especially since there is no template or quantitative formula to determine whether a good faith effort has been made, is totally unreasonable. Even the proposed alternative 24 hour deadline for the apparent low bidder to submit its good faith efforts documentation should that contractor fail to reach the DBE contract goal is unreasonable.  We strongly recommend a longer time limit, such as seven (7) days, be allowed for a contractor to provide an accurate good faith effort determination, especially considering the intent to remove the opportunity for prime contractors and DBEs to sit down after the bid to reevaluate the scope, an issue addressed previously. 
It is for these reasons that we urge you to not adopt these rule changes.  Thank you for your consideration of our comments.   ",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2012-0147-0280/attachment_1.pdf",

The US DOT must consider removing purchase and re-sale of asphalt oil to meet goals from the DBE program. Asphalt oil is an expensive commodity used for road construction projects and prime contractors abuse this to meet most of their DBE goal requirements. This has a negative impact on the intended development of other small specialty trade firms that can be providing valuable service on these projects.

Frankly, none of the DBE firms have the financial ability to purchase this expensive commodity, especially when the terms of payment are within 10 days of purchase.  This means that more often than not, DBE firms engaged in sale of this product are merely extra participants used by prime contractors to meet DBE goal. Most purchases are via joint checks, and these run into tens of millions of dollars. Many times, these commitments at bid time never match the utilization. 

For example, a review of the CA DOT post award bid site (bids already awarded are posted online) indicates that a firm know as E.M. Oil has supplied approximately  $200m worth of asphalt oil on Caltrans construction projects in the past two years.  However it is believed this firm has never filed any tax with the IRS for the five years, or if it has, their gross receipt is nowhere near actual commitment else this firm should have graduated a long time ago.  It is believed that this firm’s file was recently taken over by Caltrans from the City of Los Angeles DBE program to pursue investigation since City of Los Angeles had not reviewed the firm in the past five years. The firm also “provides” asphalt oil for Local Agency projects and rumor has it that this firm is owned on paper by single women, but is actually a front for Paramount Refinery based out of Los Angeles.  

Allowing such abuse of the DBE Program is outrageous and frankly making a mockery of the DBE program and its intent.

RE: Oppose the Proposal to Substantially Alter DBE Requirements and Practices

Dear Ms. Jo Anne Robinson:

I am writing to you on behalf of Matcon Diamond, Inc.  As a contractor involved in transportation construction projects funded by the US Department of Transportation (DOT), my company is gravely concerned about the proposed changes to the DOT`s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program (Docket No. OST-2012-0147).  We believe that the proposed regulations will create significant administrative burdens to both the contractors and the state DOT agencies which will result in higher compliance costs. 

Our major concern is that these proposed changes do not consider the challenges contractors face when competing in a low-bid procurement system.  Our specific concerns are outlined as follows.  

LISTING DBE’s AND SUMMARY OF SUBCONTRACT WITH BID - The proposed requirement that prime contractors provide with their bids a list of DBEs that will be utilized on the project, including details about price and scope of work, is unreasonable and we believe will actually result in less DBE participation.  

The nature of the low bid process allows the prime contractor sufficient leeway to maintain its flexibility in executing subcontracts and selecting subcontractors (both DBE and non-DBE) for a project. Typically, the subcontractors submit their bids only a few hours before the prime contractor's bid must be submitted to the DOT. These bids are faxed and possibly discussed briefly over the phone and the prime contractor must hurriedly compile its own bid. This period of time is hectic and the tasks to be completed are complex. Thus, the bidding process puts the subcontractor and the prime contractor in a very different position as to the content of the subcontract. The subcontractors have the ""luxury"" of preparing their bids on their own timetable, subject only to the deadline for submitting their bids to the prime contractors. The primes, on the other hand, are dealing with all of the various construction aspects of the project and with numerous potential subcontractors. They compile their bids within a few hours of the deadline for submission, and specifics are necessarily given less than thorough consideration and are often left for future negotiations.  

Currently, DBE and non-DBE subcontractors negotiate a fair and balanced formal contract in a good faith manner even after the bid. If your proposed standards are implemented, DBE contractors would be absolved of the ability to negotiate based on the low bidder’s confidential construction methods that may have won the job.

Keep in mind that these creative techniques most likely will impact many aspects of the subcontractor’s initial scope.  This ‘locking in’ of the DBE’s at the time of bid will eliminate the mutual acceptance, or “meeting of the minds” component, which is integral to establishing a legal contract.

Furthermore, denying the prime contractors the time to evaluate DBE subcontractors’ quotes post-bid will lead primes to reject all incomplete or potentially inaccurate quotes and to just focus on only meeting the minimum DBE contract goal.  Often times, the time spent on going back to mutually clarify quotes leads to increased DBE participation, which is an opportunity that will be lost if these proposed changes are implemented.  This will inevitably lead to the opposite intent of the DBE program, which is less DBE utilization.  It is for these many reasons that we strongly oppose the listing of DBE’s and the summary of the subcontracts with the bid.  

GOOD FAITH EFFORTS - Equally troubling is the proposed requirement that primes who are unable to meet DBE contract goals must submit their good faith efforts documentation with the bid.  Providing good faith effort documentation at the time of the bid, especially since there is no template or quantitative formula to determine whether a good faith effort has been made, is totally unreasonable. Even the proposed alternative 24 hour deadline for the apparent low bidder to submit its good faith efforts documentation should that contractor fail to reach the DBE contract goal is unreasonable.  We strongly recommend a longer time limit, such as seven (7) days, be allowed for a contractor to provide an accurate good faith effort determination, especially considering the intent to remove the opportunity for prime contractors and DBEs to sit down after the bid to reevaluate the scope, an issue addressed previously. 

It is for these reasons that we urge you to not adopt these rule changes.  Thank you for your consideration of our comments.",,,,,,,

RE: Oppose the Proposal to Substantially Alter DBE Requirements and Practices

Dear Ms. Jo Anne Robinson:

I am writing to you on behalf of Quaker Sales Corporation.   As a contractor involved in transportation construction projects funded by the US Department of Transportation (DOT), my company is gravely concerned about the proposed changes to the DOT`s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program (Docket No. OST-2012-0147).  We believe that the proposed regulations will create significant administrative burdens to both the contractors and the state DOT agencies which will result in higher compliance costs. 

Our major concern is that these proposed changes do not consider the challenges contractors face when competing in a low-bid procurement system.  Our specific concerns are outlined as follows.  

LISTING DBE’s AND SUMMARY OF SUBCONTRACT WITH BID - The proposed requirement that prime contractors provide with their bids a list of DBEs that will be utilized on the project, including details about price and scope of work, is unreasonable and we believe will actually result in less DBE participation.  

The nature of the low bid process allows the prime contractor sufficient leeway to maintain its flexibility in executing subcontracts and selecting subcontractors (both DBE and non-DBE) for a project. Typically, the subcontractors submit their bids only a few hours before the prime contractor's bid must be submitted to the DOT. These bids are faxed and possibly discussed briefly over the phone and the prime contractor must hurriedly compile its own bid. This period of time is hectic and the tasks to be completed are complex. Thus, the bidding process puts the subcontractor and the prime contractor in a very different position as to the content of the subcontract. The subcontractors have the ""luxury"" of preparing their bids on their own timetable, subject only to the deadline for submitting their bids to the prime contractors. The primes, on the other hand, are dealing with all of the various construction aspects of the project and with numerous potential subcontractors. They compile their bids within a few hours of the deadline for submission, and specifics are necessarily given less than thorough consideration and are often left for future negotiations.  

Currently, DBE and non-DBE subcontractors negotiate a fair and balanced formal contract in a good faith manner even after the bid. If your proposed standards are implemented, DBE contractors would be absolved of the ability to negotiate based on the low bidder’s confidential construction methods that may have won the job.  These methods may include a creative plan that the prime contractor will use to build the project at a lower cost. These methods are not disclosed with the subcontractors who are simultaneously communicating with all of the other prime contractors competing for the same project.  Keep in mind that these creative techniques most likely will impact many aspects of the subcontractor’s initial scope.  This ‘locking in’ of the DBE’s at the time of bid will eliminate the mutual acceptance, or “meeting of the minds” component, which is integral to establishing a legal contract.

Furthermore, denying the prime contractors the time to evaluate DBE subcontractors’ quotes post-bid will lead primes to reject all incomplete or potentially inaccurate quotes and to just focus on only meeting the minimum DBE contract goal.  Often times, the time spent on going back to mutually clarify quotes leads to increased DBE participation, which is an opportunity that will be lost if these proposed changes are implemented.  This will inevitably lead to the opposite intent of the DBE program, which is less DBE utilization.  It is for these many reasons that we strongly oppose the listing of DBE’s and the summary of the subcontracts with the bid.  

GOOD FAITH EFFORTS - Equally troubling is the proposed requirement that primes who are unable to meet DBE contract goals must submit their good faith efforts documentation with the bid.  Providing good faith effort documentation at the time of the bid, especially since there is no template or quantitative formula to determine whether a good faith effort has been made, is totally unreasonable. Even the proposed alternative 24 hour deadline for the apparent low bidder to submit its good faith efforts documentation should that contractor fail to reach the DBE contract goal is unreasonable.  We strongly recommend a longer time limit, such as seven (7) days, be allowed for a contractor to provide an accurate good faith effort determination, especially considering the intent to remove the opportunity for prime contractors and DBEs to sit down after the bid to reevaluate the scope, an issue addressed previously. 

It is for these reasons that we urge you to not adopt these rule changes.  Thank you for your consideration of our comments.

All with the hopes of getting the contract with the general contractor that will be the apparent low bidder. This process stress the resources of the DBE. Under the current process the DBE can focus on meeting with a single general contractor - the low bidder.

Prepaid books of flight coupons are very popular and if the customers agrees to make a advance deposit to guarantee so many seats at a preferred seat price and agree to keep it in escrow until applied to a flight date or until the expiration of the coupon book-  it seems that would be logical.

With regard to ACMI-  Since all the ticket sales remain in escrow  (with the exception of Travel Agent commissions) and for all the years we have flown charters it was the carrier that was responsible to ensure compliance and  the return of round trip passengers that it would make sense that if a carrier wants to enter into an ACMI agreement-  they bear the burden of risk with the 10 day period which could be addressed simply by the carrier getting a security deposit or some other assurance for the projected costs of the variables that are not included in each contract.

This is most defiently something that should be Implimented on every bus. There are many disabaled people that take use of public transporatntion. So without something that gives them a comfortable way to load the bus then why would they want to use it? I most certainly support this, and would like for the DOT to act on it.",,,,,,,

We do not own or operate any wheelchair lift motorcoaches. 

We have many senior clients on fixed income that have worked with us for over 20 years. Our prices for many of these clients has remained well below market as we have found attempts to raise prices result in loss of business to cheaper and less safe competitors or a stop in travel altogether. If one of those clients starts requesting a lift bus and we are forced to farm out the job to a higher cost company (one company has recently quoted a lift bus at $1,000 for a trip we get $700 for). At over $500,000 for a new lift equipped bus which we would have to keep around for a 48 hour demand AND can't use on major sports teams due to decreased seating/luggage space, it puts a company like ours in a no win situation. While our current requests are less than 3 per year, if one of our clients decides they want a lift bus, we are not allowed to let them go to a supplier that can fit their needs.

Further, we have lost significant business during the holiday seasons as Peter Pan was forced to use Lift buses on every run. It seems a far more reasonable approach would be to require the first bus on a run to have a lift with priority seating for those requiring it, and allow the back up bus (the role we played in past years) to operate with out one. 

Thank you.

I am writing to provide input regarding the EAS proposals for the village of Tatitlek. The Chugach School District fully supports the proposal submitted by J&M Alaska Air Tours, dba Alaska Air Transit, marked Proposal A.

The Chugach School District (CSD) is a public school district that serves students across 22,000 square miles of the Prince William Sound region. With transportation options limited to air and water, routine, reliable, cost effective, and safe air travel service is required for CSD to meet Alaska’s constitutional obligation to provide effective public education to students in this area. 

For the past 18 years, CSD has successfully contracted with Alaska Air Transit (AAT) to provide transportation and cargo service to help facilitate our educational services in Tatitlek and across the Sound. Our students and staff travel with AAT for a wide variety of educational purposes, including routine itinerant specialist support for students. Parents and staff must have complete trust in an air service provider before they will agree to step onto a plane, or before they agree to put their children and grandchildren on a plane. The trust that AAT has developed with our students, families, and staff is founded upon the robust safety practices that have been implemented by new AAT ownership since 2004. The CSD School Board not only reviews these safety practices, but they see these practices first hand as they fly with AAT for various School Board activities which require air travel. When those safety practices are coupled with the world-class level of customer service, which AAT always provides, it is an easy annual decision to continue the CSD continue the CSD contracting relationship with AAT. 

I thank you for this opportunity to provide input.
Bob Crumley, Superintendent

Feel patient's urine could be first poured off for DOT and papers completed and then employee gives remaining urine for added test. This would not violate hi 4th or 5th amendment while not requiring second specimen that may take hours to give new sample and would assure it is same sample thus avoiding confusing if dot sample and separate second sample do not agree. Company would save time away from work and employee would not be forced to produce new sample after his original one was destroyed minutes before.",,,,,,,

FR Doc No: 2013-16789
Filed on behalf of:
Foley Carrier Services, LLC.
140 Huyshope Avenue,
Hartford, CT 06106

Foley Carrier Services provides third-party administrative services to more than 42,000 clients, most of which perform drug and alcohol testing to meet Federal Requirements of the Department of Transportation. Our organization sees tens of thousands of drug and alcohol tests performed every year and our clients come from every state in the union. We have been providing DOT-compliant testing services since 1992.
We strongly encourage the continued collection of information from the Alcohol Testing Form (ATF). It has been our experience that the information gathered on the DOT ATF (as well as the Custody and Control Form) is highly accurate. This data can be used to monitor the overall progress of the DOT drug and alcohol testing program as well as to highlight causes of concern. Studies have repeatedly shown that alcohol is the number one cause of workplace safety issues. We believe that the DOT should continue to administer its program in the successful manner it currently is. This includes the collection and publishing of this vital data.
However, we believe that there are steps that could be taken to improve the collection process. We encourage the DOT to consider moving away from a paper-based system and embrace electronic information collection. We believe shifting to an electronic system would significantly reduce the cost and time burden of the collection. It would also provide more timely access to actionable data. Given the large number of tests performed each year, this would have a positive effect environmentally as well.
Another area for improvement we see is to allow third-party administrators to be a part of the remediation process for alcohol tests as is the case with controlled substances tests. Many motor carriers, particularly small carriers rely on their administrators for guidance and compliance help. Given the DOT’s goal to improve safety on the roads, it is in the public’s best interest that carriers have a means to rapidly share alcohol testing information. Today’s three part form does not provide that capability. In many cases, this leads to a hole in recordkeeping, and, in worst-case scenarios, can result in carriers making the wrong choices regarding drivers with positive test results.
