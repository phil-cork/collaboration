The convenience factor was wonderful and the pricing, compared to Huntsville, was close enough that it was justifiable to fly from here.  When we had to fly through Memphis, prior to that, we could never get any good connections, so we wouldn't do it.

When SeaPort airlines was at the Muscle Shoals Airport, we went and took a look at what they had to offer and were quite impressed.  Yes, the plane was smaller, however, they were offering several flights daily at a very reasonable rate of $98/round trip to Atlanta.

If you award the contract to GulfStream, you will be losing a lot of business, as the bookings over the past couple of years show.  The connections through Atlanta are so much better than through Memphis.  I just checked on airfare to New York (LGA)..we have  a trip planned in April, and, to get there from Memphis....I will have to fly from Memphis...to Atlanta...to New York and it will cost me $266.  Then, add the $150 to get from Muscle Shoals to Memphis....the fare is $416.  I checked the fares from Huntsville and I can fly Huntsville to Atlanta to New York for less than $300 on the same dates.

I think it would be a huge mistake for you to award a contract to GulfStream, a company that has recently filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy (http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2010/11/05/gulfstream-airlines-files-chapter-11.html) and has recently been fined by the FAA for improper practices (http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2131185820090521), when you have the opportunity to work with a smaller company who offers much more personal service and is willing to work with the citizens of the area they will be serving.

It took us YEARS to get out of having to fly through Memphis....and have decent air service....and, now you're going to put us right back into the same mess we were in.  With this decision, you will be going backwards.

Michael P. Chisena, as sole inventor, has been awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office two (2) separate and distinct U.S. patents both entitled “Train-To-Platform Gap Mitigator.”

The first patent - Patent #7,784,406; Serial #12/116,078 was awarded on August 31, 2010.

The second patent - Patent #7,913,628; Serial #12/837,185 was awarded on March 29, 2011.

The device of said patented invention mitigates the gap width between the train car and its corresponding rail station platform edge. 

Said patented device simultaneously accomplishes the dual goal of permitting all rail line systems to achieve and/or maintain gap width clearance mandates set in law, by industry standards or recommendations and/or by the rail line system itself ensuring the safe passage of all trains through each of its stations within its system while providing gap mitigation as may be required by law or otherwise necessary to facilitate passenger safety in boarding and alighting trains regardless of size of any existing gap along its route resulting from any cause. 

By utilization of said patented device, all rail carriers can now achieve compliance with existing Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) gap width mandates and the U.S. Department of Transportation implementing regulations without the necessity of any modification to said regulations as presently proposed in February 27, 2006 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Docket # OST-2006-23985 / RIN 2105-AD54).

I'm writing because there has been two times on my flights in the last two months where a single passenger has brought on two ""emotional support"" animals on my flights. The animals (both small dogs) sat on the passengers lap during the entire flight, at times, moving to the neighboring passengers lap.

The emotional support animals are becoming very popular. It is the best way to have your pet outside of the carrier during flight as well as avoid any fee for transporting them. Plus, there is no limit, so you can bring all of your animals with you on the full flights. In fact, everyone can bring all their animals. There is no limit.

This needs to change. There is no reason why one passenger needs more than one animal to provide emotional support...and if there would be...in that extremely rare case, then that passenger could go through the proper channels at the particular airline to discuss their unique issue (or travel with a second person).

My airline says their hands are tied. The DOT should address this. While I understand the reason you passed this rule re: ESA, what was a well-intentioned idea has hurt more than it's helping...bc many people don't want to sit next to two animals on a full flight (and they are all full these days).

Please change this rule to limit ESA's to one per person. Not a ""service animal"" limitation in general, just an ""emotional support animal"" limitation, since those animals are basically just your pet, traveling outside of their cage, on your lap during the flight.",,,,,,,

More importantly, however, is holding the airline accountable for what they do not provide.  For example, I understand that there are minimum penalties to be paid to bumped passengers. Bumped passengers who arrive at their destination less than two hours later than planned should get the value of their one-way ticket back, up to about $400 in cash. However the airlines are masterful about avoiding this penalty as they fill a plane with standbys, even knowing that there are passengers arriving on their own planes with connecting tickets, then leave the gate early so that connecting passengers 'miss' their flight. As they are not 'bumped', they are not compensated. Any new laws should address this type of practice.

The compensation for airline passengers delayed due to maintenance issues does need to be enhanced.  It is ignored by the carriers in an attempt to keep costs down.  But the net impact is a major disruption for passengers.  For the first two weeks in January, Delta airlines managed to have serious maintenance delays for every single plane I attempted to take either booked or on standby because of missed connections due to maintenance issues.

Airlines cannot control the weather, just how they handle it.  But the airlines are in control of their maintenance and have been failing miserably.  The impact to the passengers is just as bad as when delayed due to weather but is unforgivable because it can be controlled by the airlines.  I propose any aircraft delay due to maintenance greater than 1 hour should require $100 refund per passenger.  Maintenance delays due to maintenance in excess of 2 hours is a refund of $200 per passenger.  Maintenance delays in excess of 4 hours is a full refund to the passengers.  Flight cancellations due to maintenance are full refund for passengers plus hotel expenses until the airline can get the impacted passengers to the target destination and an addition $60 per day for meals during the delay.",,,,,,,

As a mother of children with multiple food allergies (boy-shellfish; boy-peanut, treenut, egg) I am of the opinion that kids with allergies need to learn to manage them and live within the world as it exists.  I do not promote living in a bubble and our family does eat out.  However, I also teach my boys to use extreme caution when eating foods I have not prepared for them by reading labels EVERY TIME, or if we are out, telling the wait staff of their allergies.  I tell them that they should also ask to speak to the the chef or manager if they feel wait staff seems to lack specific understanding of food allergies or if they feel uncomfortable for any reason.  They carry Benadryl and epi-pens with them, in case of an emergency - and my older son, because he is not always with an adult, also carries a cell phone.  Finally, they know that in the event of a reaction, they can LEAVE immediately and someone will get them help immediately - at the nearest hospital if necessary.  
THE ABILITY TO LEAVE AND GET HELP DOES NOT EXIST ON A PLANE, which is the primary reason I am in support of banning peanuts on all airplanes.  Those allergic to peanuts tend to have the most severe and life threatening of all allergic responses and the fact that they are on every plane, (thus traces are on every seat, armrest, etc.)  is terribly dangerous for those who are allergic.  A peanut free zone or peanut free flight does NOT eliminate those traces and therefore is not protective.  PEANUTS SHOULD BE BANNED FROM FLIGHTS.",,,,,,,

I think you are forgetting two other causes of air problems. Weather and the customer. 

Having worked for Cat for 40 years, I flew over 2 million miles and had my bags lost once. 

I get to the airport normally 2 hours before the flight to ensure me and my bags make it. 

If all the
gates are full and there are planes sitting on the tarmac, are they supposed to let the passengers off on the tarmac when it reaches the designated time? Plus, it is not the pilots who decide when to move. 

Also, if the airlines could charge the passengers who make a reservation and then don't cancel, they wouldn't have to overbook. 

Please look at the whole picture before changing or making up rules.

I flew regularly before developing the allergy but have avoid flight since. I contacted the airline to find out what there policy was and they assured me they could accomodate quite easily.  So I purchased my tickets. Upon arrival at the airport, they explained they were not peanut/nut free friendly. Good thing I was prepared. They did create a three row barrier but those of us with allergies know that three rows is not sufficient for those that have airborne allergies.  When opening a bag of nuts the tiny particles fly far and can be deadly for those with allergies. Many airlines still sell peanut/tree nut items on their carts when there are so many other options out there.  It seems it would be in the airlines/passengers best interest not to have to divert an aircraft because a passenger became anaphylactic.  There are reasonable options out there. I'm baffled as to how accomodations can be made for other disablilities but this one is so blantenly disregarded.  I'm sure if the head of the organization had a peanut/nut allergic child, the rules would be different as one does nut understand the seriousness unless they have a personal experience with it.

We appreciate this opportunity to submit comments on this notice and strongly support setting up this on-line complaint form for the public to electronically submit aviation service-related complaints against air carriers. Deaf and hard of hearing people struggle every day accessing information in airports and on air carriers as critical information is often relayed auditorily and is not available in visual formats. This includes but is not limited to information about: flight delays and cancellations, baggage claim numbers, gate changes, and emergency information.  To enhance the quality, utility and clarity of the information collected, we suggest the following:

1. We urge the DOT to make this complaint webpage fully accessible to all deaf and hard of hearing individuals by providing all written instructions for filling out this complaint form in American Sign Language (an online video of someone signing the written information.) Agencies like the FCC and IRS have led the way in providing online information online in ASL as many deaf and hard of hearing individuals are not fluent in English and need information translated into ASL.

2. We urge the DOT to accept complaints in ASL as many deaf and hard of hearing individuals are not fluent in English and are best able to communicate through ASL. This would mean allowing deaf and hard of hearing individuals to submit video complaints in ASL. The FCC accepts certain comments in alternative formats (see 47 CFR § 1.1803.)

By allowing deaf and hard of hearing members of the public the ability to comprehend complaint information and file complaints in ASL, this complaint form will allow one of the most marginalized groups the ability to effectively file complaints. Section 504 requires that federal agencies provide information made available to the public accessible and ensure equal access for people with disabilities.

Since climate change threatens our planets survival, environmental protection and energy conservation are critical.
A few Americans may already have died due to climate change; I refer to the fact that West Nile Virus did not occur here until 1999 and could be a result of global warming.

Mass transportation tends to require less fossil fuel and hence produces less carbon dioxide than private automobiles. Therefore rail roads are preferable to highways and to air transport. For trips over 2,000 miles, air transport may be the most efficient mode.

If there are areas that are not the same, add a page indicating blank page or no requirement for this number. 
192.163 Compressor stations 195.163 Blank page.

This would not change the rules, just make it more understandable, and  benefit the inspectors and operators. Plus if the inspectors are training from liquids to gas the rule numbers decimal are identical. I have spoken with many inspectors in different states and they ALL agree.",,,,,,,

Programs of this nature are typically small and have very minimal environmental consequences, but even attaining appropriate right of way, utility clearances, and other clearances are very cumbersome. 

Also, the consultant selection procedure is very time consuming and expensive relative to the project. A small, locally sponsored sidewalk project worth $200,000 may take 2-3 years to implement due to all these burdensome requirements. 

These time-consuming and inefficient regulations are a poor use of federal funding. States need some flexibility in how they implement projects, especially for these smaller, community-based projects. ",,,,,,,

The current revenue cap is based on a company's gross receipts, which can be significantly dependent on material costs. West Fuels is a DBE fuel distributor and is greatly affected by the dramatic increase in fuel prices.  At today’s prices, annual revenues for current contracted business will be approximately 30% higher than expected, and will likely exceed the cap. 

I propose that the DOT follow the SBA size standards which are determined by revenues and number of employees per industry classification.

It is not logical for us to lose our DBE certification status due to increased costs, rather than a true increase in business.

PROJ. CRITERIA REVISION
WORK TYPE WITH NO ACCIDENTS Work Type proposals with no accidents is against the guidelines of FHWA.
SAFETY INDEX The Safety Index Calc. undervalues the cost of accidents, & has fatalities & injuries as a single category. The Accident Reduction needs definition.
MIN, QUALIFICATIONS With no minimum requirement, much is wasted on unrealistic applications. Proposals have values of 0.05 when the cutoff was 300. As many as 90% of the projects do not qualify.
LOW $ LIMITS It is a political decision to limit project funds to a pointlessly low amount.
REVISING ESTIMATES Low-Ball estimates are selected, only to return requesting additional funding or a reduction in project scope.
PROJECT DELIVERY Awarding a project to an Agency behind schedule on an existing project is poor stewardship.
Improvements to Selection Criteria
Select proposals based on a revised SI ranking, the cost of the project & the history of accidents with the potential for safety improvements.
An Agency with an existing project behind schedule is disqualified from submitting new requests.
Revise the Safety Index Calculation to reflect real accident costs.
Revise the cost of accidents to segregate minor injuries from major ones & set fatalities as a separate cost.
Revise the SI with the Expected Accident Rates for the types of work.
Define the Accident Reduction to the Expected Accident Rate.
Rank all proposals in one continuous SI priority list.
A minimum qualifying SI rank will allow no proposal to be accepted with a score of less than one half of that SI score.
Raise the grant maximum to (10% - 15%) of the total funds available to the State for that year.
Fix grant cost in the application and no adjustments can be made until the project is completed as scoped at the Agency’s expense.
On completion, the Agency may request extra funds with a revised SI calculation.  If the Project qualifies for funding in the year it was selected, extra funds will be OK'd.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2011-0025-0022/attachment_1.doc",

We are a coalition of bicycle, pedestrian, and trails groups in Missouri with an affiliated membership of over 30,000 across the state.  Most of those organizations are involved in grants involving bicycle, pedestrian, and Safe Routes to School projects either as advocates, citizens supporting these projects, or as direct grant recipients.

In addition, we organize and operate the Missouri Safe Routes to School Network, with over 100 agencies, individuals, and organizations working to support Safe Routes to School programs.  Many of these agencies and organizations have applied for and/or received Safe Routes to School grants and one of the primary purposes of the Network is to work to improve the implementation of the federal Safe Routes to School program and grants.

We heartily endorse the comments about this program and solutions offered by the Safe Routes to School National Partnership, particularly these sentences:

""Unfortunately, there is a key challenge hindering construction of these projects—delaying the installation of safety improvements, increasing costs, and reducing efficiency. The challenge is that Safe Routes to School projects are governed by Title 23 regulations, which are primarily targeted to large-scale, complex, federally-funded highway projects. Both local award recipients and state coordinators have indicated that the time and effort needed to comply with these regulations is high given the small size and scope of the typical SRTS award (the average size is approximately $150,000).

""As a result, obligation rates have lagged. As of December 31, 2010, states have awarded approximately 71% of available funds and have obligated 43% of available funds.""

We have heard this same comment and sentiment from SRTS grant applicants from across Missouri.",,,,,,,

Thank you for this opportunity to express my views on this issue. I have been a for-hire charter boat fisherman since 1989 in Destin, Fl. In 2004 I bought my own 6 pack charter boat (I have Federal Reef and Pelagic permits. With that said and done I have a vested interest in the rule making by NOAA & NMFS. In fact here are a list of Rule changes since 2044:

1.Red Snapper Season shortened from 189 days (April 15-October 31) 
to 54 days (June 1st -July 23rd). Hmm that's a reduction of 325%
  a. Bag limit decreased from 4 per person (including Captain & Mate 32 total) to 2 per person (excluding Captain & Mate  12 total) Another reduction of over 70% Yet every year since 2004, except 2010 (Deepwater Horizon) recreational fishermen exceeded their TAC!
  b. 2010 Dr. Crabtree stated ""Red Snapper are no longer being overfished"" 
  c. 2011 will have a TAC increase but wait a minute the average size of Red Snapper is 5.3# and the increase in days will be taken away to reflect bigger fish!
  d. Why are we using pounds for recreational TAC? Makes more sense to me use numbers of fish to get an accurate and not best guess available to really know how many fish are being caught.
2. Trigger fish went from 11"" overall length to 12"" to the fork,  less than a year later 14"" to the fork length.
3. Red Grouper was declared undergoing overfishing then a year later using the same DATA was  not  being overfished. Same crystal ball (DATA) was used for King Mackerel and Vermilion Snapper.
4. Greater Amberjack went from 28"" fork length 1 per person bag limit (including Capt. & Mate) to 30"" 1 per person (excluding Capt. & Mate) that's a reduction of 30%. Then why is it we met our Quota (recreational) for the first time in October 2009 at which time NMFS closed down Amberjack.
5. Gag Grouper went from 5 per person bag limit to 2 per person to an emergency 6 month closure 1-1-2011 till 6-1-2011 with a possibility of no ",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2011-0025-0033/attachment_1.docx",

Dear Mr. Eisner:

Thank-you again for the opportunity to present remarks regarding the Orange County Transportation Authority’s (OCTA) Breaking Down Barriers initiative at the Department of Transportation’s (DOT)  March 14, 2011 public meeting regarding Regulatory Review of Existing DOT Regulations (Docket No. DOT-OST-2011-0025).  During my remarks at that meeting, I made reference to a report being prepared for OCTA by Ms. Susan Binder and the firm of Cambridge Systematics.  This report compiles information from over forty interviews with highway and transit project implementers, as well as several national trade associations which represent these entities.  As I said at the public meeting, this report contains the details regarding  proposals which OCTA believes will greatly assist in expediting project delivery. Although the report is still being finalized, the Draft Final Report is complete and was reviewed by our Board on March 28, 2011 with unanimous positive reaction. 

Therefore, in order to meet the comment deadline for this docket, I am submitting the Draft Final Report for your consideration.  Appendix D to the report provides a table of the recommended changes to expedite project delivery, noting where regulatory changes may be needed. 
OCTA expects that the report will be finalized within the next few days, at which time we will make a copy of the Final Report available to DOT, separately, and as a further submission to this docket if it remains open for comments.

Sincerely,

Darrell Johnson
Deputy Chief Executive Officer
Orange County Transportation Authority

With the exception of the CDL, those drivers operating the first group (10,001 to 26,000 GVWR) must follow the same rules as operators driving heavy truck-tractors.

Usually, the first group of vehicles are operated by private motor carriers of property.  Those companies do not transport goods and services for hire.  Their primary function is not trucking, but (in the case of Welltec) to provide oil/gas well down-hole services with CMV operation as a function of going from the shop to the well site with people and equipment.

It is illogical to equate oil/gas well service field engineers with for-hire over the road truckers driving heavy trucks.

I suggest that the FMCSA create a department that would regulate that small goup of drivers (10,001 - 26,000 GVWR CMVs) with less stringent HOS rules and RODS requirements.  Our drivers may only drive 3 -4 hours/day, but may work at the well site for 2 - 3 (or more) days.  It seems unnecessary to regulate non-truckers the same way as the 18-wheeler drivers.",,,,,,,

In reviewing existing significant rules during this process, NCSL urges the department to incorporate into the review process a comparative analysis of the costs estimates for state and local governments developed during the rulemaking and the actual cost of implementing the final rule.  The analysis should include a review of what went into the estimates as well as how accurately they reflect the real world costs associated with implementation. For instance, did the cost estimates for the regulation include both the cost of implementation as well as on-going costs?  What federal funds were provided for state and local implementation?  Did they cover the costs?  Were there under-funded or unfunded mandates?   Could the regulation be modified to minimize the fiscal impact on state and local governments?

NCSL also recommends that the department review the level of consultation that occurred in the development of any significant regulation. Consultation with state and local governments should be conducted early in the process, prior to a document being sent to the Office of Management and Budget. As part of the department’s plan to review existing significant rules, NCSL encourages the department to reach out to organizations like NCSL to determine if meaningful consultation occurred during the development phase.

The attached rail routing rule (Hazardous Materials: Enhancing Transportation Safety for Hazardous Materials Shipments--PHMSA-RSPA-2004-18730; RIN 2137-AE02) is an example of where “meaningful” consultation was not conducted.

NCSL looks forward to working with the department as this process moves forward.

The guidelines currently in use have not substantially been reviewed or revised in over 40 years.  HPMS Field Manual has been recently revised and new implementation is beginning.  Functional classification is related and should also be reviewed.  Urban Area boundaries might have more utility for transportation planning as an ""urbanness"" index assigned to US Census geography, or to features inside the US Census features.
Since 1991, Functional classification has been used in some cases solely as a funding tool, and objective trip length data for classification is difficult to obtain and measure.  The Functional classification system needs to be more robust to accommodate more classes to provide better utility at the local and regional levels to perform sound planning.  Normalization of classes and better objective criteria would help unify data used by RITA and by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
Section 500.101 should include a component for GIS for definitions and scope.
Section 656 Carpools and Vanpools currently have a gap in coverage of incentives for not-for-profit, non-profit, and government agencies.  The Commuter Benefit Program provides good incentive for these activities with reimbursements and tax credits for taxable organizations, but there is no provision to provide reimbursement or incentive for untaxed entities.  Some sort of program should be added to provide incentive for these organizations to participate.",,,,,,,

""Due consideration"" of bicycle and pedestrian needs should include, at a minimum, a presumption that bicyclists and pedestrians will be accommodated in the design of new and improved transportation facilities. In the planning, design, and operation of transportation facilities, bicyclists and pedestrians should be included as a matter of routine, and the decision to not accommodate them should be the exception rather than the rule. There must be exceptional circumstances for denying bicycle and pedestrian access either by prohibition or by designing highways that are incompatible with safe, convenient walking and bicycling.

I have seen comments submitted by AASHTO recommending that FHWA should rescind their guidance on the meaning of “due consideration” on the grounds that it places 
 undue burden on states to justify exceptional circumstances when not including provisions for bicyclists and pedestrians in a project.  

As a transportation planner who has worked on local bicycle and pedestrian projects for over ten years, I strenuously object to AASHTO’s proposal to roll back federal regulations directing state DOTs to ensure that their projects include provisions for pedestrians and bicyclists.  The existing regulations are consistent with my own state DOT’s policies and directives, but this should not be taken for granted.  Many state DOT’s lack similar regulations, so federal rules are crucial to providing incentives to accommodate walking and biking as a routine part of all transportation projects.

If there is science to indicate a health problem, use it. I have used these devices and can attest to the fact that they put off no odor. If we are going down the road of banning things that others merely do not understand, then may I suggest banning excess perfume on passengers instead, since that actually IS offensive to other passengers and has been linked to triggering migraine headaches and allergy attacks when sensitive individuals are exposed in unventilated areas.

If you are worried about other passengers ""feeling"" like they might be getting toxins blown at them then you should worry about the passenger whos perfume can be smelled from 10 rows away or the guy next to you that didnt shower.

As a user, I would like to keep the device in my possession (as I am currently allowed to do with cigarettes) so that I may use it upon exiting the aircraft.

The use of an electronic cigarette has allowed me to completely stop smoking. I am convinced that it is much less harmful than cigarettes. By restricting their use on flights, you are making it more difficult for those of us who are trying to be healthier.

As for complaints by the public, I am not convinced that they are as widespread as this rule suggests.

Their use is not detectable by smoke alarm, so the bathroom is probably where this would happen. Other people need to use the bathroom for its intended purpose.

Please do not waste staff time by making them enforce this silly rule. I am sure airport and airplane employees have better things to do than search out and stop e-cigarette use.

Smoking of Electronic Cigarettes on Aircraft

I am in full support of this regulation to ban the use of Electronic Cigarettes on airplanes.

No one should be exposed to the chemicals in the vapor created by these devices without consent.  There is not sufficient evidence that the problems associated with second-hand smoke are not associated with the e-cigarettes.

In addition, designs that mimic actual cigarettes can lead to confusion and could cause significant disruption on a flight.

There are no second hand dangers related to electronic cigarettes. There's no smell, and no fire hazard.
As an individual who has switched from traditional cigarettes to electronic cigarettes I have to say I never really planned on using one during a flight. This is mainly because most of my flights are less than two hours. My main concern is that this may give electronic cigarettes the same kind of stigma that traditional cigarettes have.
If you are going to end up banning electronic smokes during on planes, can it be met ""half-way"" and make sure that electronic cigarettes can be used in the airport and terminals? I think many e-smokers out there would be fine with that arrangement. Not ""vaping"" on a plane is one thing, but still having to go outside and then back through security again during a stop over/flight change to use it is what would anger me the most.",,,,,,,

The notion of banning electronic cigarettes for the sake of public health in regard to aircraft passengers by method of enforcing their regulation as identical to traditional tobacco smokers is both unfair and cruel. Those who choose to imbibe nicotine by electronic cigarette do not represent the same crowd of individuals that are commonly found to smoke cigarettes. They are frequently former traditional smokers who are seeking a healthier alternatives but are plagued by an addiction that has clearly demonstrated neurological effects.

The merit of this effort is ideological at best and serves no genuine benefit to public health. These are individuals already aspiring to help themselves and others who are being targeted to accommodate enforcement. It is understandable that confusion among those who are poorly informed is undoubtedly an issue but that is not justification for this treatment.

I myself AM NOT A SMOKER and I have a father who has smoked ALL of MY life. I understand the good intentions of this effort and support the idea of discouraging smoking. At the same time I understand that the HABIT OF SMOKING is a neurological need for long time users. The emotional duress caused by those like my father who have been unfortunate enough to succumb to the HABIT AS A NEUROLOGICAL NECESSITY for emotional stability is not only unfair to him but to family which endure this stress.

Quite frankly even if there WAS any form of measurable impact to health comparable to a traditional cigarette, I would much rather lose five minutes of MY LIFE than endure a five hour flight with someone struggling the neurological withdrawal symptoms. Yet, as I presently informed by the sciences, the vapor imbibed it and expelled from an electronic cigarette user to be no more toxic to myself than the air of any busy American city.

I would not wish undue stress on my lawmaker in session. I should hope you would not wish it on a well-meaning citizen in transit.",,,,,,,

I will mention that I do not smoke, and I also do not like the smell of secondhand smoke. The rule seeks to prohibit something that is, arguably, a manifest goal of anti-smoking groups, presuming that goal is to eliminate tobacco smoking. If the reasoning behind a ban on smoking tobacco products on a plane is to prevent secondhand smoke injuries & complaints, and also to prevent creating an uncomfortable environment for fellow passengers, this rule does not achieve those ends. However, electronic cigarettes were designed to assist smokers in smoking cessation, and also to allow smokers who do not wish to quit to have the ability to facilitate a personal choice without disturbing those in their vicinity. The byproduct of electronic cigarettes is water vapor, which is literally no worse than the combined exhalations of a full passenger jet. Further, this rule seeks to prohibit one harmless byproduct, with no consideration of any other, actually harmful byproduct; an individual with a minor upper respiratory tract infection, who spends the flight coughing, is sending vast quantities of particulates into the air, possibly infecting and sickening others - yet there is no rule against flying when sick. An individual with a child who refuses to quiet down, and cries incessantly throughout the flight could be damaging to fellow passengers ears and mental health - but there is no rule against flying with children under age 6. Similarly, this rule does not actually serve any purpose, and only serves to appease those individuals who would ignorantly claim that it bothers them. It is justifiable only when rules are implemented that regulate personal hygiene, parenting behaviors, and like. Meanwhile, it deprives those individuals who did the homework, and made the switch to electronic cigarettes, knowing that there are ZERO effects to persons not consuming the electronic cigarette.",,,,,,,

Electronic cigarettes are an electronic device that produce an inhalable vapor via heating, rather than producing smoke via burning.  The vapor may or may not contain nicotine.  There is no fire risk and no combustion byproducts exhaled by the user of an electronic cigarette.  The vapor that is exhaled by an electronic cigarette user is mostly water vapor, and thus i no more dangerous to other passengers than normal exhaled breath.

Other non-tobacco nicotine delivery devices include gums and patches.  The form of the electronic cigarette mimics that of a tobacco cigarette for ease of use to tobacco cigarette users, but the form does not dictate the function.

Key points: 
~ Electronic cigarettes burn nothing and produce no smoke.
~ Electronic cigarettes contain no tobacco.
~ Electronic cigarettes are not hazardous to non users.

E-cigarettes are cigarettes only by name. Those are not really cigarettes, nor they are burning tobacco products by any stretch of imagination. They have no smell, no burning tobacco products, no proven health hazards by the exhaled, mostly water vapor. The inhaled nicotine (much smaller quantity than normal cigarettes contain) are absorbed by the users lung, and the exhaled water vapor, if it contains any nicotine at all, must be negligible amount of trace chemical. 

Banning those on airplanes would be equivalent banning airplanes altogether, because of the increased amount of cosmic radiation. It other words, ridiculous.

Electronic Cigarettes (""eCigs"") do not fit under the definition of tobacco products as they do not contain tobacco.

The name ""cigarette"" is only added to this device for marketing purposes.

The purpose of the 2000 Rule prohibiting smoking on air carriers was mainly due to the health issues associated with second-hand smoking. There is no data showing similar health issues associated with eCigs. 

The function of an eCig is that of vaporization of water and additives (which may or may not include nicotine - the effective chemical in tobacco cigarettes). Smoke is not a byproduct of eCigs as with conventional cigarettes, but rather a fine water vapor. The effects of this vapor on the consumer and/or surrounding persons has not been deemed 'harmful' which adds additional doubt to the purpose of the proposed rule change. 

As it currently stands, no evidence that these devices harm anyone exists. To ban their use on air carriers is equivalent (in my opinion) to banning soft drinks on flights. Both are items which are used/consumed by passengers that have no direct effect on surrounding parties. 

The excuse of ""confusion"" is not justification for such a rule change. If the device is not affecting the passengers or the aircraft, then attempting to regulate it becomes a waste of both time and money. ",,,,,,,

Why should a non-asthmatic passenger be put at risk by the propellent in the inhaler?

Please avoid the knee-jerk reaction of banning something just because it looks like a cigarette.  Air travel is miserable enough already.  If flight attendants are being hassled by passengers who can't tell the difference between a real, burning cigarette and a nicotine inhaler, maybe they should distribute an educational leaflet.

The only other valid complaint a passenger may have is that the vapor is perfumed.  I don't see you banning passengers from wearing scent, so please toss that complaint out too.

As you can see, this line of reasoning is absurd. We can't make everything that MIGHT be uncomfortable to someone illegal.

Electronic cigarettes are a great alternative to smoking. The government should be encouraging the use of them to get people away from smoking tobacco, which does negatively affect the user and everyone in the vicinity.

Electronic cigarettes should only be banned because of their health risks if there actually are proven health risks of electronic cigarettes.

If e-cigarettes are tobacco-free nicotine delivery systems for users who exhale a safe water vapor, they could provide an outlet for habitual smokers prohibited from smoking on flights.  I've heard of cases where smokers tried to sneak a regular cigarette, and the plane had to make an emergency landing because of security concerns.  

Since many people are addicted, allowing them a means of getting nicotine is clearly preferable, if there are no chances of doing harm to others.

Considering how stressful flying can be, allowing smokers a safe outlet that does not harm others is erring on the side of freedom.  On the other hand ,if e-cigarettes can be proven hurt or bother others, ban them and you'll get no complains from me.  Science > Prejudice.

Electronic Cigarettes are an important tool in helping people to quit smoking.  It provides harmless nicotine while eliminating the tars and poisons found in tobacco.  

Ever since Boeing and others decided to build planes with unhealthy systems that no longer exchanged stale and infected internal cabin air with clean external air, smokers have been forced to rely on patches, pills, and will power.  Now, there is a safe healthy effective tool that helps people to quit smoking and also helps to eliminate CPOD, Emphysema, and Cancer and many other diseases.  Instead of promoting its use. liberals mindlessly complain that it ""confuses"" them, confuses them???!!!

Question:  Is is proper to encourage smoking and other unhealthy behaviors in order to avoid ""confusing"" a few scatterbrained flight attendants?  Is their ""comfort"" more important than human lives?

Electronic cigarettes have been proven to be both effective and safe.  They produce no objectionable odors nor do they release any unsafe chemicals into the air.  Users breath in a combination of water vapor and nicotine (harmless by itself) and exhale simple water vapor (if anything).

This is a product whose use should be promoted and encouraged.  Critics do nothing but promote increased rates of Cancer and other diseases and should be sharply rebuked.",,,,,,,

I can fully understand the protections provided to other passengers from the effects of in the cabin tobacco smoke, but the byproduct of an e-cigarette doesn’t even come close to the same issue.
I do not smoke, however my wife does.  She has since her early teens to now in her fifties.  Quitting seems like the logical thing to do and is the mantra bashed into our heads every day, but it’s not that easy for most.  It’s an addiction equivalent to heroin, and even heroin addicts are allowed to use transition devices to quit.

My wife uses the e-cigarette in her attempt to stop in the inhalation of so many chemicals, while at the same time providing the relief she needs for her addiction. Most importantly, it is a god send on long flights, ALL of which to get out of Alaska are long; we really have little choice in this regard.  Banning this device will return her to her fear of traveling; affect her mental wellbeing while on trips, and cause a great amount of anxiety at layovers as we try to get outside for her to smoke and then fight the security lines to get back in.

It’s bad enough that as a society we allowed her to become a victim of the smoking habit as a teenager, that now as an adult just trying to keep her sanity flying, we’re going to punish her yet again.  With the lack of any scientific data on the second effects of these e-cigarettes, which I believe are negligible to non-existent, this really borders on a law that singles out one segment of the population, and that is unconstitutional.

   What most people don't realize is that when a person using an E-cigarette inhales the heated liquid nicotine into their lungs, like every other breath they take, only 15% remains in the lungs. The other 85% is exhaled into the air.  
   So if I'm a former smoker, having recently quit, and my body is free of nicotine, I'm now forced to be exposed to the airborn chemical in an enclosed environment such as the fusealage of an airplane.

On one hand, as a former pack-a-day smoker, e-cigarettes have most likely saved my life. After 14 years of smoking a pack a day I have not had a single cigarette or the desire for one in the past 6 months, and as e-cigs allow for their users to step down their nicotine level I have also reduced the amount of nicotine I take in. In this sense I dislike seeing any bans on ecigs.

On the other hand, I recall being a non-smoker and not appreciating being around someone who is smoking. I can empathize with the concerns of those who don't use e-cigs and are concerned for their health and well being.

I have seen lots of statements pointing to a lack of information on the products themselves and the potential health risks to the users and to bystanders. What I have never seen stipulated in any bill is a clause stating that this ban would be removed if evidence came to light that, as has been claimed by the e-cig community and MANY health professionals and laboratories, e-cigs are in fact benign to users and bystanders. The chemical composition is known. The batteries used are known. Extensive research has been done on the chemicals used in the liquid in their other uses outside of being a delivery system for nicotine. 

Not once have I seen this research cited. 

The research is being done. Rather than cost more tax dollars to be spent to overturn a ban once e-cigs are proven to be safer to users and completely safe to bystanders add provisions to these bans that they would be lifted once proof was given.",,,,,,,

I believe, however, that the proposed regulation needs to be modified to ensure that individuals who are using products that are similar in appearance to an electronic cigarette, but that do not present the potential of similar risks to other passengers, are not inconvenienced or otherwise affected by the proposed regulation.

Notably, the Nicotrol Inhaler is a prescription drug that is very similar in appearance to an electronic cigarette.  The Nicotrol Inhaler consists of an inhaler, or puffer, that looks much like a cigarette and contains a nicotine impregnated cartridge on which the user inhales, or puffs.  Statistics show that use of this inhaler doubles an individual’s chances of quitting smoking (http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/archives/fdaDrugInfo.cfm?archiveid=1502)

The proposed regulation should explicitly PERMIT the use of all products such as the Nicotrol Inhaler that have been approved by the FDA for use in smoking cessation.  It should also permit the use of placebo products that mimic the appearance of a cigarette, but do not emit vapor, as a matter of right.

Further, the regulation should require the explicit education of aircraft personnel as to which devices are permitted and which are not.  It is otherwise certain that well-intentioned, but ill-informed airline employees will from simple confusion attempt to bar individuals from using devices which they are entitled to use, simply because they look like an electronic cigarette.  This is particularly important in the current environment, in which simple acts of disagreement with cabin crew can quickly escalate into something far more serious.

I have reviewed the argument laid forth by the government for the proposed rule making and find that there is indeed a stark lack of data regarding the effects of propylene glycol from e-cigarettes.

While the opinions of such figures as the USAF Surgeon General and USN are noteworthy and demanding of respect, the requirements of the military are distinct and separate from the needs of a free civilian populace. 

Given the already egregious impositions on the people by the government in the name of security, the proposed rule making seeks to remove one of the remaining vices by which the average American may cope with the inconveniences and burdens placed upon them by their government.

The FDA still lists propylene glycol as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe). OSHA has not defined a PEL (Permissible Exposure Limit) for the aforementioned chemical. The opinions of the FDA and OSHA should be construed as more relevant and concise to this particular issue than the supplied sources of the government.

While I do concur that additional testing and regulation would be necessary within the field of e-cigarettes, that fact-finding should occur at a minimum before the restriction of e-cigarettes from aircraft.

Many people claim that e-cigarettes should be considered harmless because they have not been proven to cause damage. I would be inclined to approach the situation from a different viewpoint. Many of my patients are suffering from the devastation caused by tobacco use, either their own or another’s. Some of these patients began using tobacco prior to the Surgeon General’s explicit warnings. Cigarette smoking was seen as a harmless pleasure until rigorous studies indicated otherwise. I have a fear that the same will hold true for e-cigarettes. Innocent airline passengers should not be subjected to those dangers in the meantime. 
Since tobacco users continue to engage in an activity that has uncontested evidence of obvious serious harm, studies showing the very real dangers of e-cigarettes will probably also be dismissed. One such study was published by Anna Trtchounian and Prue Talbot in December of 2010. That study illuminated several concerns about e-cigarettes, including the inconsistencies in manufacture, fallacies in marketing, and health issues in disposal.
The main consideration is that when it comes to the absorption of chemicals into our bodies, we should be very concerned with what we do not know. A tobacco user may not be the appropriate person to ask about whether non-smokers should be exposed to these products.
The only viable argument against the ban on in-flight use of e-cigarettes is that we should not be so ignorant as to need one.",,,,,,,

Although there are many valid reasons for preventing the use of certain materials (including smoked tobacco and electronic devices) they all seek to minimize some harm. Until such time as these devices have been shown to cause any detriment to the aircraft, crew, or passengers they should not be regulated at the federal level. If the individual airline chooses to ban their use that is their prerogative, but the regulatory actions proposed will create a whole new class of felons, who stand to lose a great deal of personal liberty.

Work published in Tobacco Control has shown that these products vary greatly in their composition, ingredients, use profiles, nicotine content, nicotine delivery, packaging, and many other aspects. They are an unregulated chemical product that is currently exposing users and those around them to unknown substances, since there is no oversight of their ingredients. Regardless of whether they may be eventually shown to be helpful to tobacco smokers seeking to quit, or to be shown to have minimal harm to users, it would be unconscionable to force passengers in the enclosed space of an aircraft cabin to be exposed to aerosolized ingredients from these products, which could precipitate anaphylactic reactions in sensitive passengers or affect the health of others in as-yet unknown ways.

While someone very close to the user may faintly detect the flavorings in the vapor, it is far below the level of the average perfume/cologne or a soiled diaper.

Personal Vaporizers are NOT SMOKING.

1.  There is no SMOKE.  It is misleading to the public to categorize these devices as 'SMOKING'.

2.  The presence of any tobacco product is only an assumption.  If a Personal Vaporizer has nothing in it derived of any kind of tobacco product, then how is this a 'tobacco product'?  Will you do a chemical analysis of every single personal vaporizer to see if it contains nicotine?

If the DOT finds significant risk in operating a small battery and heating element in aircraft by individual passengers is unsafe to the general public in any way, then so be it, but make the ban in a separate and distinctive code of its own.  Saying it is 'SMOKING' and including it in the smoking portions of the code is going to lead to many problems in the future, some of them possibly even Constitutional in nature.

Finally, before banning something it would be nice to have evidence that it is harmful to any person or property at all!.

Passing unconstitutional rules, codes, and bans ""Just Because You Can"" is one sure fire way to witness the public backlash against the Patriot Act.  For every inch the department takes with harmless things like personal vaporizers, it looses a MILE in public opinion on serious matters like scanning for weapons and preventing sabotage or terrorist attacks.

If the personal vaporizer is dangerous, by all means remove it, but do it properly.  It is NOT SMOKING!",,,,,,,

I support the Dept. of Transportation (DOT) in this excellent idea.  I frequently fly, as do my family members and do not want them (nor anyone else) exposed to the e-cigarettes “smoke”

The e-cigarettes are highly controversial in my mind, they are not regulated and little is known about what is used in them.  In some cases, I’ve read that there are carcinogenous compounds being used.  Any of this can be recirculated in the airlines air systems.  

Work recently published in the “Tobacco Control” peer-reviewed publication (British Medical Association) shows that these products do vary greatly in their composition, ingredients, nicotine content & delivery (just to name a few).   Please keep in mind that these are UNREGULATED CHEMICAL PRODUCTS, and there is no data at this point showing that they are helpful to tobacco smokers who wish to quit (in spite of what the companies say that manufacture the products).  

To allow e-cigarettes on board any aircraft would be exposing all passengers and crew members to the ingredients used in these products.   It’s hard enough today to travel, let along being exposed to this during an entire flight.  

For the person who can’t stand to be on a long flight without a cigarette, there are other ways to control the nicotine desire that don’t affect the entire plane of passengers (chewing gum for one comes to mind).

Please go forward banning these e-cigarettes on board all aircraft.

Thank you.

Second, I would like to explain why.
I've been using electronic cigarettes(e-cigs) for a number of months now. Not only has my personal health improved, but the health of my husband, who is a nonsmoker, has improved as well. Whenever I am forced to go stand with smokers in order to vape, I start to cough almost to the point of vomiting from the cigarette smoke. It's just that awful since I quit them. 

Third, I would like to show you something, assuming anyone actually reads this.

There is a compilation of reports made by various places on the effects of electronic cigarettes, including all the separate ingredients, exhaled vapor, and inhaled vapor. That website is; http://www.electroniccigaretteban.org/electroniccigaretteban.org/reports-electronic-cigarettes.htm 
Unlike what you would expect, they give -all- information, including the short, fairly slapdash, report that the FDA did in 2009. Funny though, that the FDA fails to mention the fact that the carcinogens that were found in e-cigs are also in the gum and the patch that they currently think are the best thing ever for quitting smoking. And in a lesser amount. Interesting how that works out, huh?

Anyway, that's my two cents. I'm happily using e-cigs, and I have no want to ever smoke a traditional cigarette again. These things have been a godsend for me, and many others, who have tried quitting with the patch or the gum, and couldn't.

Some may argue that it is ""necessary"" so that tobacco users suffering from nicotine withdrawal can get their ""fix."" I disagree entirely, the user can simply use chewing tobacco as an alternative that does not physically disturb nearby passengers.

Smoking use, burning tobacco, has been proven to contain carcinogens in second-hand smoke, when breathed for extended periods of time.  Sitting on a plane, with re-circulating air, one could safely conclude that the use of burning tobacco on an aircraft could be seen as a potential health hazard.

However, this regulation is based on, well, nothing.  Regulations should have proper scientific evidence in support of the rule.  The logic employed here is not sound.  The only information available is that the end result of E-Cigarette usage is water vapor.  Water vapor is prevalent in nature and therefore has 0 effect on people.

So to utilize that logic one would need to make another argument to regulate use of something innocuous as seen.  If there is a secondary scent (which there doesn't seem to be) that could be used.

Since E-smoke has no smell and is shown to contain no other elements to it, I request that one this regulation not go into effect; or, if it does, that it be amended to also apply to anyone wearing any aromatic scents that could be intrusive to me (perfume, and cologne).

Anyone who burps after drinking a can of soda would probably be releasing as much water vapor, not to mention vapor released by expelling gas after eating a bean burrito! Eureka !!!  Lets propose a ban on all vapors released on airplanes too!!! 

Should someone who holds and pretends to suck on a painted stick (imitation cigarette) because it satisfies their cigarette handling and oral fixation, be banned just because it ""looks"" like he's smoking a cigarette?  I think this ban should be challenged as an invasion of civil rights!  There is no proven physical harm to anyone in the vicinity of an e-cig, and probably never will be.

Since my success, every smoker in my office has tried using these devices and has ALSO succeeded in quitting smoking.  How wonderful for us all!  Perhaps giving free reign for these to be used in any location will encourage others to make a full switch to electronic cigarettes simply for the convenience.

This is not true for all brands of e-cigarettes.  BluCigs, the brand I use, contain no propylene glycol and instead, use USP glycerine to aid in the vaporization process and give the ""look"" and ""feel"" of smoke (source: http://www.blucigs.com/cartridges).  The liquid in BluCigs cartridges is produced in the USA at an FDA-inspected facility and contains none of the questionable ingredients found in Chinese-made smoke liquid.
Second, the vapor produced when using BluCigs is odorless and dissipates in seconds.  It is composed mostly of water and poses no threat of secondhand inhalation.  In my experience, people do not even realize that I'm using my BluCig unless they actually see me using it.
Third, the use of smokeless tobacco products is already allowed onboard airline flights. E-cigarettes should be placed into the same category, as they produce no odor nor waste (""spit"") to deal with.
Fourth, while the FDA does regulate e-cigarettes as a tobacco product, this is misleading.  This FDA regulation simply means that e-cigarettes cannot be sold as a stop-smoking aid.  It does not imply that e-cigarettes contain tobacco.

Finally, I would like to state that those of us who both smoke and fly are very much against any further regulation of our choices.  We are already forced to give up smoking from the time we enter the airport terminal until the time we leave the terminal at our destination, with the exception of those few terminals that still have smoking areas in the secure areas.  This adds further stress to an already stressful evolution (flying).  Please don't take away an option that allows us to satisfy our nicotine addiction without causing any harm, secondhand or otherwise, to anyone.",,,,,,,

The vapor is released directly into your lungs, works much effectively than gum or losenges, and should not be catagorized any differently than gum or losenges.  

I don't use my e-cig on flights due to discrimintation against smokers, I don't want the dirty looks of disgust from my fellow passengers, but being able to use the e-cig before I board a plane or on long layovers is a godsend.  There it NO risk to bystanders, I am not inhaling all the trash and tabacco found in regular cigarettes, so it's a win/win situation.  I don't have to go through w/drawals in the airport, and it's healthier for me and NO ONE is at risk by allowing me to do so.  Everytime you serve an alcoholic beverage to someone who may have been drinking in airport bars for hours before boarding a plane, you are endangering people MUCH more than the imagined risks of e-cigarette vapor.  I support banning the use on planes, but not in the airports we find ourselves stuck in for hour b/4 we even board a plane at times.  

I really believe that this is just discrimination against nicotine addicts/smokers, and I think most people would agree. A large percentage of the population is holier than tho regarding this addiction while turning a blind eye to other more acceptable addictions like alcohol, pain killers, anti depressants, diet pills.  Why not check eveyone's bags for those things too so we can make sure no on is doing something the public at large is ""disgusted"" with.  Do not ban smoking e-cigs in airports, it's violation of my rights.

I am against banning e-cigarettes on airplanes  (or anywhere else for that matter). As a smoker, I find that e-cigs are not a suitable permanent replacement for cigarettes, but having an alternative filler is indispensable. 

I would argue that a passenger having a nicotine fit could be far worse than one that is calmer with access to a 'nicotine pacifier'.   I have tried using nicotine gum, and find it to be just plain nasty and does little to easy my need to 'puff'.

As for 'bothering other people' because they 'psychologically' think the guy next to them is smoking. I think if you showed the fellow passenger it's not a real cigarette they would feel better. I have blown vapor into the FACE of coworkers who were curious about this thing, and they were astonished that they could smell nothing! 

STOP trying to regulate every facet of our lives! You are trying to do it with outrageous taxes and it does nothing but hurt the poor. Do you not understand the strength addiction?

No. Absolutely not.

For a 4 hour flight, a smoker can expect not to be able to light up for 8+ hours.

2 hours before (for security, because the nanny-state fascists won't add a smoking area past the security screens like they do in other countries)
4+ hours of the actual flight
1+ hours disembarking
1+ hours baggage claim

An electronic cigarette emits nothing but water vapor.  Nothing. It has the same emissions as a hydrogen fueled car.

Liberty, the pursuit of happiness.  Those are MY rights.

Obesity is a plague on America. Do you put oppressive taxes on Ding-Dongs, Coke and Candy Bars? tax the obese?  Do you tell obese people to eat outside? Do you create anti-obesity sections of restaurants? Do you ban the obese from entering government buildings?

There is absolutely no body of evidence to indicate that the vapor from electronic cigarettes poses any health risk. Even the original study by the EPA for the harmful effects of ACTUAL cigarettes is heavily flawed and overstated, with an almost undetectable percentage of people exposed *consistently* to second hand smoke developing symptoms. (About 500 per 100,000,000 studied.) 
Again, these are the EPA's stats for COMBUSTIBLE cigarettes, so what percentage of the general population do you think would be effected by tobacco-flavored water vapor?

The Secretary of Transportation was cited as saying ""Airline passengers have rights, and this new rule would enhance passenger comfort and reduce any confusion surrounding the use of electronic cigarettes in flight"".  I am literally offended by this for several reasons. First, the courts and TSA have made it increasingly obvious that we have no rights in the sky, which is a trend in need of immediate reversal. Second, seeing as how the concern is allegedly for the comfort of passengers perhaps you should take into consideration the comfort of smokers and former smokers using these devices as part of their nicotine replacement therapy. Since the effects of a few airborne micrograms of lab-produced insulin have not been studied in depth, would you propose that diabetics not be allowed their insulin shots aboard planes?
Why don't we just ban everything that may irritate another or produce undue fear for lack of proper research?

Will flannel jackets induce night terrors? There's no research, so let's ban them! 

Furthermore the smell of perfume makes me nauseous, so does that mean you'll be imposing a ban on scented oils for the *comfort* of your passengers?

This is the kind of poorly thought, corporate-driven nonsense that epitomizes our government today and whoever put this idea on the table should resign immediately.

Should we ban people who are wearing perfume/cologne?  If we ban something based on an oderifous limit and emissions, we would have MANY items to ban.

I would venture to say that the parts per million of water vapor/alcohol/and propylene glycol (the ingredients in a solution of an electronic cigarette, all of which the FDA regulates and are safe for consumption) would not nearly compete with the breathe of someone who just drank a small ariplane vodka or the intrusive odor of someone who just put on perfume/cologne after emerging from one of those smoking lounges in the airport.

Promoting the ELIMINATION of combustion (THE LEADING CAUSE OF THE RELEASE OF CARCINOGENS), willful inhalation of carcinogens, and second hand smoke should be a priority.  EDUCATION can be used to calm the travelers who are ignorant about the device and it's uses.  

The promotion of this device can save lives and help people to stop smoking actual cigarettes.  Relinquishing control to people who have no working knowledge or understanding of the device is naive.

While it makes sense that the DOT might perceive the operation of a lithium battery and a small heating element a possible safety concern, it still is NOT SMOKING.

IF the personal vaporizer is indeed a safety hazard, please have some evidence of this, and treat the personal vaporizer as something separate.  IT IS NOT SMOKING, by ANY DEFINITION.

On the ground, in terminals and airports, please be very careful about enforcing bans on these devices.  Unlike smoking, it does not require expensive separate ventilation systems and produces no litter or harmful environmental conditions.  Forcing rules on this would just send people who rely on vaping to quit smoking out past security terminals for no good reason at all.

Please allow passengers to keep their personal vaporizers in their carry on bags.  They are no more or less dangerous to public safety than a lap top computer or a cell phone.",,,,,,,

Affects to Users. The FDA recently studied two brands of electronic cigarette liquid and the report noted that the two brands tested contained low amounts of nitrosamines which are also found in many products including nicotine replacement therapies such as the gum, the patch and the Nicotrol Inhaler. The Commit Lozenge is the only nicotine product that does not contain nitrosamines. Nitrosamines are also found in meats purchased from the local grocery store and increase in toxicity levels based on the temperatures at which they are cooked. They can also be found in beer and are finally, injected into food products like bacon.

The review of the FDA report also found, as the liquid is vaporized and not ingested, that the only impurities found in the inhaled vapor at trace levels were cotinine or β-nicotyrine and “There is no indication in the published scientific literature that cotinine or β-nicotyrine are carcinogenic or have toxicity ratings of concern.” 

2. Affects to Bystanders. In September of 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), determined that “the Agency has concluded that there are no endpoints of concern for oral, dermal, or inhalation exposure to propylene glycol.” It was also noted that “A review of the available data has shown propylene glycol to be negative for carcinogenicity in studies [and] therefore, no further carcinogin studies [and] therefore, no further carcinogenic analysis is required.”

Propylene glycol vapors and mists have been studied since the early 40′s on all types of specimens from monkeys, rats, human adults and human children. It IS the base ingredient in most anti-bacterial air products found in hospitals. Also found was “Lacking any active ingredient or any gaseous products of combustion, the PG mist or ‘smoke’ is not harmful to bystanders. The ‘smoke’ or mist is not tobacco smoke, and not from combustion, no flame is lit, and is not defined as environmental tobacco smoke.”

Please reconsider this ban.",,,,,,,

I did not know whether it was legal or not on planes, I assumed they were ok since most European flights sell them in air. However I did not advertise it or be obnoxious about it when I used my e-cigarette. I covered the lighted end and exhaled in a way that there is no visual mist.

You state that the decision is based on the fact that not enough is known about the product and that is precisely the reason not to ban it yet. Knee jerk regulation is eroneous at best and wastes resources by padding the regulations and the required enforecement. 

In the interest of full disclosure I am a former smoker and current e-cig user. I can tell you that in the 6 months I have been using this product I have felt a marked improvement in my lung capacity as well as my overall health. Shortly after I started using the e-cig I conducted a test with a friend who is alergic to cigarettes and used my e-cig sitting next to him while he ate. He had no problems at all. Nor has anyone I have used it around including others who are alergic and asthmatic. Though these are not strictly scientific experiments they are certainly more revealing than someone making assumptions with no evidence, anecdotal or otherwise. 

With regard to the quality, I am sure there are companies that do have poor QA; however, the brand I use does not suffer from that issue. Is the intent of the FAA to ban all perfumes if some have poor QA and might have chemicals that could harm the user or irritate others in the cabin? I can tell you from experience that is not the case. 

In the end this proposed rule making is based on nothing but assumptions. If this is placed in the regulations it will simply be demonstrating a discrimination against people that are trying to improve themselves as well as making compromises (ie. not smoking cigarettes) in the interest of others' comfort. 

Please, be resonable and don't regulate without having the facts first. Thank you.  ",,,,,,,

I turned to electronic cigarettes because it gave me an alternative to smoking and because I don't want to breathe in all those chemicals either.  And, for many people like myself, it provided an easier method in which to give up smoking completely.

And, I don't believe that electronic cigarettes should be banned from anything or anywhere!  There is no smell, harmful second hand smoke and I'm sure that airplane air quality is much worse than having an electronic cigarette.

I only need it during an occasional asthma attack, which have been less since I am now able to exercise again because my breathing is so much better.  
When I talk to people on the street about difference between tobacco cigarettes and electronic cigarettes I always use one analogy:  A tobacco cigarette is like sitting in the smoke of a camp fire and inhaling the smoke.  An electronic cigarette is like sitting in front of a Vick's Vaporizer and in haling the vapor.  Nicotine is a legal substance.  Smoke is prohibited in most places.  Vapor is not.  The only reason I can see to ban electronic cigarette vapor on a Aircraft is to punish those who use nicotine while alcohol and caffeine are still permitted on Aircraft.

This is like saying that you are going to ban the smoking of chewing tobacco or dip on a plane. By smoking in this case I mean chewing, sucking, or how ever you would define the use of chewing tobacco or dip. Like chewing tobacco or dip there is no smoke from the usage of an electronic cigarette. There is a vapor released into the air. This my friends is a harmless vapor.  The only harm yet seen is some people don't like to see it. The choice that you are about to make is a major one and may leave you standing in a puddle of hypocrisy. Other vapors are released in planes all the time such as from people who use inhalers, nebulizors, breath spray, perfume, or ect. Are you going to come forth and ban them as well? I don't see how you can argue that one is more dangerous then the other in this situation. Your decision will also have the effect that electronic cigarette users will be pushed to smoking areas at airports. With that said I would like to quote the American Association of Public Health Physicians, ""A cigarette smoker can reduce his or her risk of future tobacco-related death by 98% or better by switching to a low risk smokeless tobacco product. He or she could cut that risk by 99.9% or better by switching to a nicotine-only delivery product like one of the pharmaceutical products or E-cigarettes. Experience suggests that E-cigarettes may be more acceptable to smokers than the currently available pharmaceutical alternatives. A smoker can secure almost all the health benefits of quitting if he or she transitions to an E-cigarette"" (April 2, 2010). Your stance for harm reduction is being made here. 99.9% reduction of the risk to a tobacco related death is alot. I assume though this is said with the thought they want be getting any second hand smoke which this ban will likely put them in the middle of. Make your choice and punish people for nothing or don't.

The federal government has always regulated substances to protect the safety of the American citizen, however when do the regulations become too restricting on freedom of choice? To completely ban the use of electronic cigarettes on airlines falls in line with the previous ban on cigarettes and other smoking products. I believe the better course of action is to make smoking or non-smoking flights legal and allow consumers to make the choice. Allow airlines to choose whether or not to put planes in the air with smoking or non-smoking flights, similar to a hotel room being smoking or non. Not to make an across the board ban.  Another issue that is argued along with this is the employees that have to work in the smoking environments. That is as simple as putting this choice of the type of flights in the hands of the consumer. Inform the prospective employee of the situation and let them make the choice to work or find other employment. Too many bans and restrictions are being imposed and removing consumer and business owner choice and preference. I believe the public should be notified of the possible ill effects of tobacco use and tobacco like products, but the ultimate choice should be left up to the business owners and the customers that choose to use the services provided.",,,,,,,

I am against the electronic cigarette being smoke on aircraft. I feel like it’s not right for someone who does not smoke have to deal with the smoke blowing in their face. Although the electronic cigarette is not harmful smoke I still feel it will be uncomfortable for someone who does not smoke. If the flight is a long one the person sitting next to they don’t want smoke all in their face. Even though the smoke is harmless it’s still not pleasant to another person.
	Smoking has been band in public and I think that was the smartest thing that ever happens. I don’t feel like the band should be lifted for the electronic cigarettes. Smoking is still the same and should be not allowed in public. It’s not far to those who don’t smoke. If you get on a plane and you smoke you should just have to wait until the flight is over.

Also ban perfumes and deodorants, while you're at it.  The chemicals present in those scents are far more toxic than anything contained in ecig vapor.    The problem with government trying to ""protect"" the people is that the so-called ""protection"" does much more harm than good.

""Can I see your ID please?"", to which I responded ""Are you carding me for the beer that I just bought or the cigarettes I am requesting?"".  ""Just the cigarettes"", was her response.

There should also be a ban on smoking on chartered flights with no flight-attendant and less than 19 passengers.

Please stop referring to ""vaping"" as smoking, they are two completely different things and should be grouped together as one and the same.

Most people are uneducated when it comes to e-cigarettes and should do some research before making such outlandish assumptions.

E-cigarettes DO NOT emit hazardous elements such as carcinogens, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, etc. such as their non-counterparts, cigarettes. They emit a ""water vapor"" produced from either propylene glycol (deemed safe to consume by the FDA) or glycerin (commonly used as a skin moistener).  Both of these substances are also commonly used to dilute drugs administered by IV in hospitals.  Propylene Glycol (a VERY powerful bactericide) was and still is misted into hospital ventilation systems to significantly reduce the amount of airborne bacteria.

There are NO known cancer causing substances in the liquids used in e-cigarettes, but there are over 4000 toxic chemicals in just one cigarette.

E-cigarettes DO NOT pose a risk of catching fire as the heating element used does not get hot enough to ignite most materials found aboard an aircraft, as well as being very well secured inside a metal sleeve which will dissipate most of the heat produced by the element.

I can see how a lit cigarette can pose a risk to health and a fire/safety hazard on an airplane at 37-42,000ft, but an e-cigarette? They are essentially a miniature fog machine and pose NO risk.

You can serve an alcoholic a drink on an airplane, which may cause him to become aggressive towards other passengers, but you won't let someone ""vape"" (again, it is NOT smoking) as they innocently sit there minding their own business?  I'm sure some people wouldn't mind paying a little extra for a seat in a vaping section.  And I'm sure non-smokers wouldn't mind a slightly reduced price on a seat in a vaping section.

I personally use e-cigarettes, and will continue to do so.",,,,,,,

FACT: Smoking residue lingers upon the clothing of the smoker for an indeterminate amount of time (we are talking days to weeks without laundering) this includes the 4000 plus harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke.

FACT: The use of an electronic cigarette should not be treated in the same vein as smoking, as they are not the same thing, the use of the ecig does NOT contain the numerous harmful chemicals and the exhaled vapor does not even contain remnant nicotine.

FACT: It has been shown time and again that education overcomes bigotry. In the case of those who may be offended by the use of the electronic cigarette, is it not better to explain the harm reduction and the comparative harm between the two as opposed to allowing the public to retain the mentality of the evil ecig thus possibly giving them the knowledge to save a life of someone close to them?

FACT: Aside from the FDA's initial scare mongering, I have not been privy to any additional info from this organization as to any further findings in regard to the electronic cigarette. What prevents this agency from fact finding as opposed to scare mongering?

The non smoking individuals are under the assumption that if they see, what appears to be smoke, or for that matter smell smoke they will be adversely affected. Even when the concentration of harmful chemicals has been diluted to the point there is no effect on them what so ever.
With an electronic cigarette there is no proven effects of second hand water vapor. The odor if any is usually pleasant. Many electronic cigarette users are using the device as a substitute for the very difficult habit of smoking using either minor nicotine levels or a zero nicotine level.

It is not smoking, no tobacco is burned and there is no second hand smoke.

The product has been on the market for several years now an no tests have been performed to indicate that there is any danger to other people by the vapor that is created.  There are no more carcinogens than there are in FDA approved products such as Nicotine gum, lozenges or a Nicotine Inhaler.

If you are going to ban usage of something, there needs to be some solid evidence that harm can come from a products use.  In this case, the only thing you're regulating is the level of discomfort you give to a passenger that may use the product.

I personally don't fly much anymore and for me it's not major issue.  However, any regulation that ties use of a product that appears to be 98-99% safer than smoking to a smoking ban is ridiculous.

Docket No. DOT-OST-2011-044
This comment is in support of the Department of Transportation’s proposal to ban the use of electronic cigarettes on all passenger aircraft. The safety and comfort of all passengers traveling in a confined space is more important than the addiction of a minority of passengers. The psychological effect of sitting next to a person who is smoking an e-cigarette is significant enough to cause other passengers discomfort when traveling. According to a recent article in Web MD, less than 20% of Americans smoke. This large difference between smokers and non-smokers should influence the DOT and airline carriers to support the interests of the majority.

The lack of scientific data concerning e-cigarettes is another concern to be taken into consideration. The e-cigarette provides nicotine to a person without the burning of a cigarette and releasing carcinogens. One of the concerns with e-cigarettes is the vapor released. The vapor released contains nicotine that can be harmful to third party individuals. The unwanted exposure to nicotine by non-smokers and children is a valid concern. There are companies that provide other products to satisfy the nicotine addiction of smokers, nicotine gum and nicotine patches are meant to provide nicotine as a substitute to smoking. 
The financial argument for banning e-cigarettes, support the idea of a ban on smoking completely. Currently, e-cigarettes bring in profits of $400,000 annually. Another concern of not banning e-cigarettes is that it will provide less of an incentive for people to quite smoking. In 2007 Americans had 96.8 billion in productivity losses due to health related problems associated with smoking. The financial numbers alone show that allowing smoking e-cigarettes and not providing an incentive to quit smoking is bad for the United States economy. 
Every effort must be made to ensure that this regulation is passed and is made clea",,,,,,,

I understand that the electronic cigarettes do not have the threat of smoke like real cigarettes do, but the other individuals on the flight may become irritated or feel unsafe.  Not everyone may know the difference of electronic cigarettes to real ones, which sometimes is hard to tell the difference between.  To me it's a reasonable regulation because the electronic cigarette gives the freedom of smoker's to smoke wherever they want, and this will help regulate that.  Everyone has their rights but when it comes to smoking, it should stay out of the public, even if it's just an electronic cigarette.  I personally smoke, but I never smoke around the public, especially small children.  I believe that children should never see that, I would rather have people look up to me in a positive way rather than for them to see me smoke and feel like it is okay.  I have tried electronic cigarettes and they have the same look as real cigarettes, so it is very hard for others to see the difference.  If they were able to be brought onto airline carriers the others around them would feel like they were being put into an unsafe condition and may possibly never use that carrier again.  Overall, I feel this to be a good regulation and I would hope that it would pass to put that ban on the use of electronic cigarettes on airline carriers.",,,,,,,

The e-cigarette is a idea that was created for these individuals. This idea has allowed business to expand their business model and create jobs for US citizens a down economy. I understand the need to regulate e-cigarettes as a drug, however, to begin to regulate where and when people could use this product is taking away from our individual freedom of choice. E-cigarettes unlike tobacco cigarettes do not cause harm to individuals. DR. Anthony Panariello, M.D – Pulmonologist states: ""Electronic Cigarette contains zero cancer causing elements in other words no carcinogens. Secondhand smoke in cigarettes have been known to cause cancer to non-smokers. Electronic Cigarette does not produce any secondhand smoke in the traditional sense – it only produces harmless vapor which according to lab reports contains 99% of water and 1% of nicotine and other trace elements which have deemed non-harmful by the FDA."" I would have to argue that if you remove e-cigarettes from aircraft, because it is classified as a drug, you would have to regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages on aircraft for the same reason. For the record I am not a smoker and agree with many of the state regulations on banning smoking from public places do to the risk on other individuals, all of which e-cigarettes do not cause on others. Also, please remember the impact this is going to have on the business of e-cigarettes and the move people will make to go back to tobacco products (known to cause cancer) which according to the newly passed Affordable Health Care Act would make the price of insurance rise for both individuals and business.",,,,,,,

I believe that electronic cigarettes should be allowed on flights, and in some instances, their use could be beneficial.  In your docket, DOT-OST-2011-0044, you state that “We see no reason to treat electronic cigarettes any differently than traditional cigarettes. The purpose behind the statutory ban on smoking aboard aircraft and the regulatory ban in part 252 on smoking tobacco products was to improve air quality within the aircraft, reduce the risk of adverse health effects on passengers and crewmembers, and enhance aviation safety and passenger comfort”(Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, para. 4).  Many smokers that are trying to quit switch to e-cigarettes to try and ease the transition.  An electronic cigarette satisfies a smoker’s cravings in two ways.  First, it supplies the needed nicotine to calm the smoker’s nerves.  Second, many smokers have a physical fixation with the act of smoking the cigarette (having it in their mouth, holding it in their hand) and an electronic cigarette helps them deal with this.  Air in commercial passenger aircraft is continually refreshed.  A Boeing 707 for example, has a complete air change refresh time of 5-7 minutes.  While traditional cigarettes contain tar and other additives that make the stench of cigarettes linger, new electronic cigarettes do not.  Also, electronic cigarettes usually contain a battery powered heater; no open flame is required, or sustained inside.  This alleviates another large safety concern concern.   I also believe being able to use electronic cigarettes on a plane might actually increase flight safety.  Fewer people will try to smoke in the lavatories, the act of which requires disabling or permanently breaking the lavatory fire alarm.  These reasons are why smoking electronic cigarettes should be allowed on commercial aircraft flights.",,,,,,,

Smoking of Electronic Cigarettes on Aircraft

I would like to submit a comment for consideration of the current policy prohibiting the smoking of Electronic Cigarettes or E-Cigarettes on aircraft.  I support the current ban, and I hope the Food and Drug Administration makes it clear to include all cigarettes banned from aircraft public or private.  Currently, the majority of electronic cigarette smokers try to work a gray area of legality.  They feel that electronic cigarettes are not actual cigarettes, but even the makers of electronic cigarettes agree that more testing needs to be done to find out the true effects from smoking electronic cigarettes.  According to an article in the Huffington Post dated 
February 11, 2011, Jason Healy the president of Blu Cigs, he understands the current ban on the product.  He says, ""It's not the actual product, it's the disruption and explaining to everyone else that it's not smoke.""  According to the same article, users and distributors both claim electronic cigarettes address both the nicotine addiction and the behavioral aspects of smoking.  It addresses holding of the cigarette, the puffing, seeing the smoke come out, and the hand motion.  It falls in the category of a cigarette, and therefore should fall under the ban.  I hope that more testing is done to prove such.  There should not be any gray area that the users can claim it is ok for them to smoke in flight.  The vapors produced from electronic cigarettes are manufactured from nicotine products which makes it a cigarette.  I hope you take these comments in consideration for your final decision.

Electronic cigarettes may be less harmful than traditional cigarettes but it does not mean they are not harmful at all. Aircrafts even the largest of them are constrained spaces and being forced to sit next to or in close proximity to someone submitting vapor into the air could be harmful and may cause discomfort. Personally I would not want to sit next to someone smoking an electronic cigarette on a plane.
	After reviewing the proposed policy I think that “smoking” may unintentionally include medical devises. To stir away from this issue I find it important to specifically state that the smoking of medically produced vapor devices are not apart of this ban and are allowed on aircraft. It is important to allow those who need to be medically treated by vapor devices can do such while traveling. 
	I believe the purposed rule will only have benefits. If an individual does not get the opportunity to smoke on the aircraft nothing bad could happen to them or their neighbors. But if an individual does get the opportunity to smoke on an aircraft there could be a lot of costly consequences that we do not know about. More testing and regulations should be required, and until then they absolutely should not be allowed on aircraft.

Removing cigarettes from airplanes was a fantastic change. They smell, leave ashes, are a fire hazard, and give off second hand smoke. Being locked in a confined space with a bunch of smokers even makes a smoker feel that he smells gross. I'm completely with you on that decision.

However, on the flip side, being locked in non-smoking areas for hours at a time causes a certain amount of discomfort for smokers. I would think that electronic cigarettes would be the solution, not a problem.

I never smoked in my home or my car, but I do use an e-cig in these places because there is no lasting odor. It can be smelled slightly, but the flavoring used resembles that found in chewing gum. Much as, yes, there is some slightly noticeable odor of a passenger chewing gum, an e-cig might have a slight scent. But it is not smoke, does not contain tar, and thus doesn't saturate clothing and cause the discoloration on the surfaces of the seating area. The scent is rarely an offensive one, and in fact non-users have often noted that they like it

There is no evidence that the vapor exhaled is dangerous to other passengers. Second hand smoke risks from cigarettes are due to their carcinogenic ingredients. The trace amounts of nicotine (the only exhaled chemical from a e-cig) exhaled was never one of the second hand smoke risks, and is comparable to that found in a tomato.

There is a stigma associated with electronic cigarettes that it's ""like smoking"". It does resemble it visually and in how it is used. That's part of its allure to smokers. However, they were designed specifically to allow something *like* smoking without all of the negative impact caused by traditional cigarettes.

Contrary to this proposal, I would think that the DOT would encourage a large sign saying, ""May be used on airplanes:"" attached to the top of a vending machine dispensing simple e-cig devices, and everyone would be content.",,,,,,,

The DOT only regulates smoking, which has a ton of scientific evidence on it's objective impact on air quality.  

The DOT like the FDA has no evidence of a single person being harmed, user or bystander, from the use of e-cigarettes, and have been in use by US air travelers for 5 years.

Provide the evidence there is an objective impact to the health of bystanders, then you can regulate it.  Until this time, this is beyond your scope.  

I personally use e-cigarettes with friends with asthma, and one person who lost a lung from cancer.  All objective evidence indicates it's statistically equal to not smoking.

Daniel Walsh
CEO Akston Hughes International

As CEO of Akston Hughes International, it has been my duty to oversee and Directr the Research and Technology associated with Electronic Cigarettes and Personal Vaporizes usage within confined, closed, and / or 'shared air' spaces.

Whether the concern be psychological or physiological, as policy makers we must seek to err on the side of caution regarding public welfare while maintaining public comfort and liberty as uncompromised priorities.

To these ends, Akston Hughes is preparing the eminent release of a device which completely eliminates exhaled vapor BEFORE it is released into the shared airspace.

This device - 'The Exhaler' allows users of Electronic Cigarettes and Portable Vaporizers to exhale into a small HEPA styled tube which completely filters all particulates from the exhaled breath.

Visibly, this creates 'NO VISIBLE' vapor, and upon testing these 'Exhaler Tubes' provide HEPA quality filtration down to the .3micron level assuring that absolutely no Nicotine enters the shared air space.

It is a solution which offers the best of all worlds: 

1. Protects the Shared Airspace from Contaminants and Irritants
2. Removes the visible disturbance of vapor
3. Preserves the Liberty and Comfort of the 45million Americans who currently smoke and may use Portable Vaporizes during confined travel.

Be aware that ""1/5 of our American Population"" are tobacco users.  Refering to this constituency as a 'tiny fraction' is a misnomer, when in fact 45 million Americans constitute a huge segment of the airline commerce - the comfort of these passengers must be closely considered in the regulation of these new devices.

In closing, may I suggest, legislation be written in such a way as to afford:

1. Voluntary compliance from Airlines (preserve liberty by leaving an option open)

2. Include wording to accommodate the use of Approved HEPA styled 'Exhalers' for use in these confined shared spaces.

I as a someone who uses electronic cigarettes understand the implications of Smoking in an enclosed area let along smoking on a plane,

I work in a call centre where I am allowed to use my electronic cigarette.
Managers have seen it, have asked questions and once I actually take a ""puff"" they smell it and they always comment on how pleasant it smells.

We electronic cigarette users do not produce harmful chemicals, we do not wreak of dirty cigarette smells.

As an ex-smoker, I feel bad for those that sat beside me when i did smoke, thats my honest opinion.

All seriousness aside, if someone was to # 2 in the washroom, but used a fruity pleaseant smelling electronic cigarette, im sure the next person to use the washroom would be happier about that.

We understand the government regulations but our voices should also be heard.

We are choosing a healthier alternative.
we are no longer burning and releasing toxins into the air.
We care about our heath & of those around us, therefore we do not smoke.

Quitting smoking is an ongoing battle no matter where in the world.  Tobacco companies profit at the expense of people's health, and Government intervention with healthcare always mention the harmful effects of smoking.  So why are we preventing people from choosing a healthier lifestyle.

Whoever reads this, if you do happen to smoke or know someone who does, persuade them to change to electronic cigarettes.  It's the best thing you can do for that person if you do truly care about them and their well being.

I haven't smoked a real cigarette for almost three years now. My health has improved drastically because of this. I also use e-liquid that does not contain nicotine now. I know many people who have stepped down to ""zero nic"" liquids, but the habit itself of the hand to mouth action, satisfies them. Why put a rule in place for people that aren't even really smoking, let alone people that aren't even using a device that contains nicotine?

Regardless of the name ""ecig"" it really has nothing to do with being a cigarette at all for some. It's not real smoke. It's not something combusting. These devices are vaporizers. They are heating a liquid and people are inhaling steam essentially. Yes there are flavorings, but they aren't being combusted. They aren't harmful to people around them and these juices contain PG or VG which are GRAS (Generally recognized as safe) by the FDA.

The fact of the matter is, there HAVE been studies done on the inhalation of PG and it's not harming anyone. PG is used in inhalers and even injected intravenously in medications. It's in food, soaps, shampoo, body washes, and other bathroom products... and guess what... when you use those things on your skin, you absorb it right into your blood stream. If PG was so bad, it wouldn't be so widely used in various applications and approved as safe by the FDA.

I fail to see any evidence provided by the DOT that they have found vaporizing to be unsafe to other people around users. Also, my understanding is that DOT only has authority to regulate smoking, and vaporizing is not smoking. I also fail to see how this is going to be enforced. Vaping does not leave ash, litter, smoke, or smell left behind. So how is someone going to be accused when you can't even prove what they were doing. People should have the freedom to vape.

 There are literally countless things which we lack a study concluding they would not negatively impact air quality. If such a regulation is needed then before it should be passed the government has a responsibility to
a) Prove that it would have a negative impact on air quality
b) Have an effective means of actually proving such action occurs.

Yet here is a study, on a government website, talking about the affects of PG which is used as a carrier for a prescription drug which is inhaled.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18158714

Here is another site that did actual testing of PG inhalation.

http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/91/1/52.abstract

So in my opinion, the article from Science Daily is not true. To state nothing is known about the inhalation of vapors when there clearly is data on this, and then to include such an example in this proposal seems a bit hasty and neither Science Daily or DOT seems to have done their research.

Furthermore, Science Daily says the group that tested this had these main observations: 

1. The e-cig hardware doesn't have proper information and warnings. (Obviously this can be easily remedied by including that information, but this has nothing to do with the vapors harming other people)

2. E-cig cartridges could leak which exposes users to nicotine. (Well, aren't they kind of being exposed to nicotine by using the product in the first place?)

3. Currently there are no methods of proper disposal for cartridges, which could lead to contamination of water and soil. (And currently there are no methods of disposal for a lot of things. Making this claim is a bit ridiculous though. Garbage and litter of all kinds, ends up everywhere, including soil and water... that would also include the litter from regular tobacco cigarette butts and wrappers/packaging from cigarettes. E-cigs aren't something that people buy every day like cigarettes and don't create nearly the same amount of waste""

4. The manufacturing, quality control, and advertising is unregulated. (Again, this has nothing to do with harming other people by vaping)

As an ex-smoker I would like to take this opportunity to point out some flaws in legislative proposals to ban e-cigarette use in public. 

Since the vapor from e-cigarettes does not produce harmful chemicals the way cigarettes do they cannot be compared in any meaningful manner. The burning of tobacco leaves produce over 4000 chemicals whereas vaporizing glycerin or propylene glycol has shown to produce absolutely no chemicals whatsoever. 

There are also some sticky legal issues with your proposal as well, to wit:

1. The DOT has failed to cite any evidence that e-cigarettes pose a threat to bystanders. There exists, however, plenty of evidence that e-cigarette vapor produces no toxic substances whatsoever.

2. The DOT's regulation is contrary to federal law. The DOT only has the authority to regulate ""smoking"".  E-cigarette use is not smoking.

3. The proposed fines of $2,300 and $3,200 for being caught “vaping” are unreasonable and excessive.

4. The DOT claims that it has always considered e-cigarette use to be ""smoking,"" but despite there likely having been tens of thousands of people using e-cigarettes on planes in the past half-decade, not a single e-cigarette user has been charged with smoking.

5. Millions of anecdotal stories, including mine, support the scientific evidence that e-cigarette usage is not only a safe alternative to tobacco use, it helps smokers quit as well, unlike the ineffective methods promoted by the pharmaceutical industry.

Please be sure to check the science as well as all the stories of healthier ex-smokers whose lives have been saved by e-cigarettes. Ask doctors who are overjoyed that their patients have stopped their use of tobacco. Make a sensible and informed decision. Once you have seen the science and the results in actual human lives, you can only conclude that e-cigarette use poses no threat public health or safety and in fact will improve health and safety for ex-smokers and the general public as well.

I realize the FDA is having a temper tantrum over the US Justice System unanimous ruling that they have no right to regulate these products- after all, we also use them in larger sizes in our childrens bedrooms when they have chest cold- Therefore, doctors individually support them.

First, I do not think the language involved in the previous ruling is strong enough to in fact cover electronic cigarettes with other tobacco products.  Since the electronic cigarettes have a different chemical make-up, a slightly different function, and a different product produced, despite meaning to imitate regular cigarettes or as stated “derived from cigarettes”, the electronic cigarettes are thus different from regular tobacco products.  Being derived from a cigarette doesn’t mean a necessary health risk to the person using the product or someone else.  If banning electronic cigarettes is the goal of the department, explicit banning of the product may be necessary.  Second, admitted within the proposed rule is the fact that there was not a fair amount of research done on the harmful effects of the vapor produced by the electronic cigarettes, and how they affect others.  I agree that the safety of the passengers is a top priority, but making such a drastic move without credible sufficient evidence is a mistake.  I would suggest postponing the proposed rule until more evidence showing the harmful effects of the vapor has been produced.  I understand the department’s view on smoking related matters, and the health effects of them, but having a product that is, while similar, not of the same content of regular cigarettes, does not mean that it has the same effects of the imitated product.  When talking about the benefits of such a rule, if the product is found to not be harmful, then the cost of implementing the rule would be more than the benefit gained.  That is why I would suggest postponing the proposed rule.

There is no smoke, merely water vapor that is emitted from these devices and although it may look like smoke, which understandably can be alarming to someone on an airplane, rather than demonize these devices people need to know more about them.  Attorney generals from, i believe, 2 states have already shown that there is no harm done to those around e-cigarette users.  To impose such a harsh penalty with no reason other than a likeness to a well known dangerous activity (smoking tobacco cigarettes), hurts both the people who are trying to live a healthier life and those that may benefit from this safer activity if they are made aware of the truth of the safety of these devices.  In addition, I would like to add that when I smoked tobacco cigarettes it would give my girlfriend allergies, merely when I walked into the same room as her.  Since I have stopped smoking and started ""vaping,"" I have constantly done so in her presence and it has never once caused her the slightest discomfort.  If more people were exposed to e-cigarettes there is a great chance that we would all benefit from the harmless vapor that is produced.  Think of all the people who could live a longer healthier life if e-cigarettes are recognized as a much healthier alternative to smoking rather than being demonized.

I feel that the current statutory ban on smoking on aircraft was intended to include all types of smoking and not just tobacco products, which would place electronic cigarettes in the prohibited category. Language used in section 708 “Prohibitions Against Smoking on Scheduled Flights” only includes the term smoking and lacks to explicitly list the items that comprise this vague definition. It is for this reason that I commend the Department of Transportation in their attempt to amend the ban to eliminate questions. 
	I am in agreement with the Department of Transportation's proposed rule to ban electronic cigarettes for reasons geared more towards public satisfaction than potential health risks. The studies that were conducted by researchers at the University of California do not present a very convincing argument as to the negative health effects of electronic cigarettes, so the argument is a weak one at this time to use as a point of persuasion. However, I am arguing in favor of the proposed rule on the basis that any act of smoking, whether tobacco or an artificial product, that occurs on a plan can and most likely would induce anxiety among other passengers, and potentially lead to negative confrontation between the user and either crew-members or other passengers. The last thing anybody wants in this day and age is any sort of panic or bickering on a plane, and I feel that an electronic cigarette could cause just this, or at the least raise constant surveillance by crew-members to insure order, which would result in the potential neglect of more important matters. Deprivation of an electronic cigarette for a few hour flight will not kill the user, and will instead satisfy all. ",,,,,,,

	The effects of the vapor that is released from these devices is not studied well enough to officially state that it is either safe or dangerous, and the inability to state that it is clearly not a health risk is adequate enough to at least temporarily ban the use of these products on passenger flights. In the future when more research can be done on how the vapor affects those around the smoker I believe this amendment should be revisited. If there is significant proof that there are no ill effects on the health of others from the products, the ban should be lifted. 
	At the present there is some research stating these vapors can irritate the throat of some third-party passengers, and there have been design flaws found in some of these devices that can expose surrounding passengers to the liquid nicotine within the cartridge of the device. As long as these dangers are present, these devices should not be allowed on flights. They are a risk to the health of others and can disrupt the comfort of other passengers on the flight. 
	I do agree with the idea proposed by the Department of Transportation, but I do hope that it can be revisited in the future once more adequate research can be done on the safety and health risks of electronic cigarettes.

First there were numerous justifications for the banning electronic cigarettes on airplanes including possible health concerns, enhancing aviation safety, and passenger comfort.  Considering the health issue this rule noted the use of propylene glycol in these products might cause adverse reactions from people who have asthma, and the FDA has noted that some of these products contain diethylene glycol which is a toxic substance found in antifreeze.  Because of the presence of diethylene glycol in some of the e-cigarettes this does seem to have sufficient reason to worry.  The other issue is one of comfort for passengers which should likely carry less weight.  Admittedly I am fairly ignorant about the any smell or other issues that might cause issues for the non-smoking passengers.  If it is true though that it is basically odorless and the main defining characteristic is the visual of the vapor than this issue seems to be one that ought to be ruled in favor of the e-cigarette user since there would be very little effect on the other passengers.
While it is currently unknown the effect of the second hand smoke further research seems to be necessary from the FDA as they begin to look closer at this emerging trend.  While we wait because of the unknown composition of the vapor and knowledge of what is contained in some of the toxins e-cigarette cartridges in the intermediate future it is likely best to take a safe strategy and ban the use of e-cigarettes.   Previous smoking bans on tobacco products occurred because of the hazardous effects that the second hand smoke had on bystanders if e-cigarettes are benign and have no effect on bystanders then this rule should be considered for repeal or amendment.",,,,,,,

ecigarettes have been a lifesaver for countless numbers of people to take back our health and hygiene. they leave behind a very faint smell at best and the associated risks are very little in comparison. to regulate the use of such a device would be akin to regulating the steam coming off of a brewing coffee pot within an aircraft or the spray of non-aerosol perfume which in comparison would be quite bothersome to fellow occupants within an airplane. i sincerely hope this regulation does not pass.

I smoked tobacco cigarettes for over 40 years, quitting twice for about a year each time ... but resumed smoking because I missed it so much. I quit forever two and a half years ago, on the first day of my use of personal vaporizers (the more accurate name for ""electronic cigarettes""). I'll never smoke again, because ""vaping"" e-cigs is much healthier and more pleasurable.

I am still addicted to nicotine and the hand-to-mouth, inhaling experience ... but now I don't ingest the tar and all the other harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke. There is no tobacco or any form of smoke in e-cigarettes. Also nothing is burned (so no fire hazard).

What looks like smoke is merely the vapor of atomized flavored USP-grade propylene glycol (used, for example, in asthma inhalers and foods) and/or USP-grade vegetative glycerin (used, for example, in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals). Since I am not exhaling smoke, there is, of course, no second-hand smoke.

Please do not deny me (and hundreds of thousands of others) this simple pleasure while flying. And certainly do not impose the proposed, excessive fines of $2,300 and $3,200, if I give into my cravings (hurting no one) while in an aircraft.

Thank you for your consideration!

In fact, even though I’m a non smoker, I’ve been around e-cigs and have no ill effects from it. 
And since the e-cig is not smoking it’s plain to see that DOT's regulation is contrary to federal law since DOT only has the authority to regulate ""smoking."" Again I say using the e-cigarette is not smoking because it creates vapor.
It’s even unreasonable and unbelievable that DOT considered the use of an e-cigarette to be ""smoking for the beginning."" Following this reason, a child playing with a toy that created steam would be considered a smoking.
I suppose you are asking why I’m so pro e-cig. The answer: it has worked for several friends and family. The improvement in their health is unbelievable. And it has become obvious that this whole anti thing has been blown out of proportion by many including the FDA, and a matter of the antis being totally unreasonable. It’s so obviously so when the antis play the “Ban it because of the children” which has been so over used for an excuse to control behavior.
Further more using the e-cig is totally better for the children since it leaves no evidence (ash, cigarette butt, etc.) of their use. The vapor from them will not put enough nicotine in the air to cause anymore harm than a brewing pot of coffee puts enough caffeine in the air to be harmful. Our factories, homes, cars, lawnmowers, boats, etc, present a BIGGER danger to our children and the rest of the public. One plane causes more pollution than every e-cig user on the planet!!!
As far as regulation in an airport or on a plane: The same rules or laws should apply that apply to using other electronic devices.
So, and I know that this is asking a lot these days, let government set reasonable rules or laws and not let, “Oh, my, but it looks like,” be the deciding factor.

What surprises me is that the DOT is not also proposing a regulation to make asthma medicine/inhalers illegal to use on airplanes as well.  Asthma inhalers contain the same Propylene Glycol ingredient found in most e-cigarettes.  The vapor that is visible in the output of an e-cigarette is almost identical to these inhalers and my wife has used these inhalers since she was a child on hundreds of flights without a single complaint from passengers or staff.  So why is it that now when e-cigarettes are becoming popular due to their beneficial smoking cessation effect is the DOT seeing this same PG-based vapor as yet another form of smoking.  I was a smoker for over 35 years and could never manage to quit the habit with any of the other conventional methods to stop smoking.  However with this wonderful e-cigarette technology, I was able to give up my 1.5 pack a day habit in just three weeks.  Additionally, I have not had another cigarette since using this technology for just shy of a year.  My asthmatic non-smoking wife could not be happier and I don't even have to go outside to use my therapeutic aide (e-cigarette). My wife is very susceptible to dangerous asthma attacks brought on by even the lightest concentration of cigarette smoke but for the past 11 months she has been completely unaffected by me vaping for several hours a night sitting beside her while watching TV.  Her doctor and mine think this technology is both safe and effective.  My doctor says he wishes he could give a e-cigarette starter kit to all of his cigarette smoking patients  If an airline says they do not want me vaping in the plane then that is their choice since they own the plane but the DOT needs to stop this attempt to vilify the e-cigarette and make it just one more thing that everybody will fear.

As a person who had used two different e-cigarettes for over six month, I agree with the proposal. 

The first e-cigarette I had was a gift from my ex-girlfriend who really hated smoking. There were reasons. First of all, smell; it smells doesn’t matter whether it has lower nicotine or tar. She used to say that the smell can reach half a mile from a smoker. Second, health; she concerned about my health and hers, saying that it is not good for either of us. Third, actually it is the biggest reason, she didn’t want to watch people smoking in front of her. She said watching it made her imagine the smell and all the negative effects of cigarette and she didn’t want to get any near who smokes. 

It was my 7th year as a smoker, but I totally understood what she said. Not good for health, for sure. Even I feel like I am bothered when I smell smoke from others. So I quit as soon as she got me an e-cigarette. But things didn’t go well. It didn’t smell like cigarette, but it smelled weird and reminded her of the real cigarette. 

E-cigarettes are to trick people into believe that they are actually smoking, the smell should be similar even though it says to has different flavor. And it bothered non-smokers just the cigarette could. It is not only about the ex-girlfriend. My sister had tried the same thing – getting me an e-cigarette – and gave up too. If two of people who loved me couldn’t stand it, these e-cigarettes are not working well. 

Furthermore, I had withdrawal symptoms when I used e-cigarette. It would not help people bear better in the aircraft. Not helping smokers, bad for non-smokers, I don’t see why people should be allowed to smoke e-cigarettes in the aircraft.

Currently air travel can be quite a stressful endeavor, why would you make even more so for someone who is undergoing a commendable life change such as trying to quit smoking?

you mention that the vapor produced can be found to be an irritant, but the percentage of people on who are effected is less then 1/10th that of people who are irritated by common scents in popular perfumes/colognes, but air travel is not designated as a scent free environment.

In addition, there are also many e-cigarette users who do not use any nicotine in their vaporizer. how could this possibly be considered a tobacco product?

I am totally against grouping e-cigarettes as a tobacco product, not only should their use be permitted during air travel, but it should be specifically noted as being allowed for use as other nicotine replacements are.",,,,,,,

The law ‘‘Prohibitions Against Smoking on Scheduled Flights’’ 49 U.S.C. 41706 does not authorize DOT to ban use of electronic cigarettes.
It states “An individual may not smoke in an aircraft.”
E-cigarettes produce vapor, not smoke.
Therefore Section 41706 does not apply to using e-cigarettes.
•	E-cigarettes do not contain harmful ingredients
The U.S. FDA failed to find harmful chemicals in the vapor. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/ScienceResearch/UCM173250.pdf 
Dr. M. Laugesen of Health New Zealand conducted studies in 2008 and declared the vapor “harmless, inhaled or exhaled.”
Drs. Z. Cohen and M. Siegel reviewed 16 toxicology studies of e-cigarette liquid and vapor and concluded, “a preponderance of the available evidence shows them to be much safer than tobacco cigarettes and comparable in toxicity to conventional nicotine replacement products. http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/centers-institutes/population-development/files/article.jphp.pdf 
•	E-cigarettes do not harm bystanders
Since those who inhale the vapor directly are reporting their health has improved, it defies belief that their residual exhaled vapor could harm bystanders.
Commercial artificial smoke generators used in aviation emergency training produce cannot be compared to exhaled e-cigarette vapor.  
	They produce a continuous, thick, dense smoke, but e-cigarette vapor is thin and dissipates quickly. http://www.bullexsafety.com/smoke_generator.aspx?gclid=CNiayLrFhKwCFYSK4AodKlMl9Q
	Liquids used in commercial smoke generators include a mixture of glycols that may be irritating to eyes airways, while e-cigarettes use USP grade propylene glycol and/or vegetable glycerin.
•	DOT has failed to produce any evidence that users of e-cigarettes or bystanders have been harmed; therefore 49 U.S.C. 41702 does not apply to the use of e-cigarettes.

I switched to using e-cigarettes over a year ago for my mother's health.  She has major lung issues.  Even with me smoking outside, the residual smoke on my clothes would set off her asthma.  Since I have switched to only using e-cigarettes, I have not been responsible for an attack.  I can use my cigarette in her house while visiting, with her sitting right next to me with NO ILL EFFECT!

This ban is ill advised and premature at best.  

There have been NO ill effects found for using an e-cigarette much less for those in the vicinity.

Any airline employee on an aircraft already has the power to ask you to stop using ANYTHING with repercussions for non compliance thanks to the Patriot act.  I personally would ask those around me first if it would bother them before using my e-cigarette.  I know not everyone is a courteous as I am, but there is already proof that non compliance has consequences thanks to the Patriot Act.

It would also be nearly impossible to enforce.  There is no evidence left behind from using an e-cigarette.  No ashes, no butt, not even the smell.

E-cigarette us is NOT smoking.  It is nicotine delivery, it is closest to the nicotine inhalers.  There is no smoke, there is no combustion.  It is fog machine vapor with a small amount of nicotine.  

The fines are also Incredibly excessive!  

When the DOT shows proof that second had vapor is dangerous, I will support a measure to ban e-cigarettes that is more realistic.  This proposed ban however is premature and preposterous.

The ban of electronic cigarettes on aircraft does the same.  When reviewing some of the facts about what is exhaled form an electronic cigarette, as biochemistry major, the true health hazards are questionable. 
	In a study done by Health New Zealand, the use exhaled vapor form electronic cigarettes are indeed shown to be safe. The study shows that amount of nicotine that is exhaled is up to ten percent less than what is exhaled from a normal cigarette. This lower concentration of nicotine is indeed safe for a third party to inhale. The study also cites that the other major chemical exhaled is propylene glycol, a chemical used for man made smog, which is also safe to inhale. Finally, the study compares the levels of all carcinogens released are in trace amounts, which too are safe to inhale. 
While this report is not a major American journal report, the since no major entity has not been able to prove the inherit risk to a third party from the device, the device should not be banned. The level of government intrusion into private life needs to be rational in it’s approach and banning a device that appears to be safe due to simply a lack of knowledge is wrong.

4. The DOT claims that it has always considered e-cigarette use to be ""smoking,"" but despite there likely having been tens of thousands of people using e-cigarettes on planes in the past half-decade, not a single e-cigarette user has been charged with smoking. The very definition of smoke/smoking does NOT describe anything having to do with vaping. 

5. I used to smoke a pack and a half per day. Now, I vape. There is no smoke or nothing burning with an electronic cigarette. My family says the vapor is pleasant and does not smell like or resemble cigarette smoke in any way. 

6. The regulation is unenforceable because e-cigarette users leave behind no evidence (ash, cigarette butt, etc.) of their use. Moreover, e-cigarette users can have an e-cigarette in their mouth without using it, users can also vape without exhaling the vapor because the steam can be held inside the mouth where it totally disappears, unlike the smoke from a burning cigarette.

It is important to distinguish between traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes when making a ban, because of the significant differences in the two. 
Having read several e-cigarette sales websites, and the information in the proposed rule, I believe that smoking e-cigarettes on aircraft can and will have a negative effect on the safety and comfort of fellow passengers. In an enclosed space at great altitude where the cabin is pressurized, any smells, smoke, or vapor would easily be extended to a third party on board. E-cigarettes contain glycol, which can cause irritation in certain individuals. Even if irritation does not occur, the discomfort and inability of a flight passenger to escape the smokers vapor range is a violation of that persons space. 
Knowing that this product can have adverse effects on other passengers health and comfort, the no smoking regulation on aircraft should be enforced and include any battery powered or electronic cigarettes. If regular smokers have to wait the duration of a flight to smoke a cigarette, than e-cigarette smokers should be subjected to the same rules.

You will note that nothinig toxic or dangerous has been found in the vapor produced by electronic cigarettes.  The obvious conclusion is that nothing exhaled by the user of an electronic cigarette can possibly be harmful to the user, let alone to any bystanders.

Rules and laws are harder to remove than they are to create, so I suggest waiting until there is an actual reason for such a ban before putting one in place.  Electronic cigarette users are generally a considerate bunch, and I'm sure we aren't planning on going around blasting clouds of vapor into the air, in spite of the fact that even if we did so it would harm no one.

In the three years I personally have been using an e cig, I have not had a single negative response from anyone around me and I have vaped side by side many avid opponents to smoking.  This proposal is not about health and that is the only issue that should be addressed.

You must understand that simply grouping anything that goes into your mouth to be inhaled and then exhaled into the same group as Cigarettes is not only unjust, it is completely unsupported by any evidence of harm to others. Should you push through with this law you will also have to Prohibit the use of Ventolin Albuterol Inhalers solely based on the fact that they are an inhaled device as well. This will ultimately bring the DOT under significant scrutiny by the medical field.

Since beginning to use Electronic Nicotine inhalers my Pulse Oxygen levels have risen from 94% to 99%. My Blood Pressure has dropped from 138 over 92 down to 118 over 70. I have decreased the time it takes me to run a mile and a half from 13 minutes 55 seconds down to 11 minutes 19 seconds.

As an asthma user of electronic cigarette products, who's lung capacity has doubled since stopping the use of traditional cigarettes & ""vaping"" an electronic nicotine device after all other FDA approved methods failed or where too dangerous for my heart condition, tried ""vaping"" at my doctor's suggestion when I learned that I not only have chronic heart failure & a bad heart valve but an aneurysm in my heart. It has worked tremendously for improving my asthma & my blood pressure.

 When I got on each of those 4 flights, I spoke with a flight attendant to make sure I could use my electronic nicotine delivery device (ironic thing being that there was no nicotine in my device as at that time I had been able to ween myself down to 0 nicotine juice so what I was vaping was simply a flavored/scented liquid that is very similar to what is pumped through hospital & airplane closed air systems to prevent the spread of pathogens & keep the clean). Each flight attendant asked for a demonstration, found it to be as safe (electronically speaking) as the batteries inside the device were Lithiion-ion batteries, very similar to what is used in a camera, and they where unable to smell any offending odors. 

I can tell you right now, with the rising cost of airplane tickets, if this ban is put into effect. I will never fly again. We all know the industry is financially suffering and has been for quite some time, but this will stop over 7,000 US citizens whom use electronic nicotine delivery devices from getting on a flight ever again. I would really hate to see that happen. As Americans, we rely on air flight as a safe and comfortable means of transportation and know that the current spike in cost of tickets will drop. But to not be able to ""vape"" on a plane and the reasons stated in the document are simply biased and unsubstantiated.

I would like to express my extreme distaste of the proposed regulation not already being in affect. I think that this should be a regulation because even though the electronic cigarette doesn’t release the carbon dioxide like a regular cigarette, it still has the vapors in it. There is still an odor with the electronic cigarette. The effects of this “no smoking cigarette” have yet to be determined and with the public bans of smoking inside public facilities already in place, I believe it needs to include the electronic form as well. I understand that they do not hold the tobacco that a regular cigarette does, but it could lead to influencing younger children to start smoking and thinking that it is the “cool” to do because it’s not a real cigarette. It still delivers nicotine into your body and can become as addictive as a regular cigarette. I propose that this regulation be implemented immediately.

It ensures that people who suffer from respiratory problems can look forward to flying comfortably without fear of their health suffering due to vapors from electronic cigarettes. It will also clear up the confusion over the legality of using e-cigarettes on passenger flights. Though I do support the proposed rule I also have some concerns. Frankly I find the lack of sufficient studies detailing the actual harm that e-cigarettes do to smokers and third parties to be a problem. Of course it is better to be safe than sorry when talking about the health of passengers and crew, but it does seem somewhat premature to ban a new product before its effects on consumers and bystanders can be scientifically determined in the same way that we have conclusively determined the dangers of traditional cigarettes. It could be potentially significant if at a later date consumers of e-cigarettes were found to introduce negligible or no contaminants into their environment. If that were true then the newly amended rule would seem to be inconsistent with and unsupported by the purpose and intent of Part 252 to “improve air quality within the aircraft, reduce the risk of adverse health effects on passengers and crewmembers, and enhance aviation safety and passenger comfort.” But besides those concerns over the science and consistency with the established rule the proposed rule is a positive step. The amended text explicitly defines smoking as the use of tobacco products or e-cigarettes while specifically excluding beneficial medicines. It seems unlikely that the language in the text could be seen as being so broad as to mistakenly include medically beneficial devices that produce a vapor. All things considered I believe the proposed rule should result in more tolerable air travel.",,,,,,,

Sufficient reason has been given in the wording of the proposed rule to grant the Department of Transportation due right to amend existing law to include electronic cigarettes.
     In addition to the reasons already given in the proposed rule, mentions should also be given to the negative externality of the decision for a person to smoke in an enclosed space, not only for health concerns but general comfort of the passengers above the aircraft should be given. Surveys consistently affirm the fact that most people do not enjoy smoking around them, and the same can certainly be said for the exhaling of vapors and mist. Aircraft passengers who exhale any form of tobacco product, and or chemical agent, into the air meant for breaking by other passengers, show little or no regard for the people around them. If electronic cigarettes truly had no bi-product that would result in the second hand experience of other passengers, a case could be made for the approval of e-cigarettes on aircraft. This, however, is not the case. Further studies should be conducted on the bi-products of electronic cigarettes before my health should be put in the hands of a passenger who happens to board the same aircraft.

The NPRM demonstrates that insufficient evidence exists to conclude that e-cigarettes do not negatively impact air quality within aircraft. It also cites a study observing that their cartridges leak, thus exposing third parties to nicotine. Given the confined environments of aircraft, nicotine exposure in any amount is a threat to third parties and e-cigarettes must be prohibited on commercial aircraft until cartridge leakage is no longer an issue.
	In the meantime, it is necessary to clarify the smoking ban so as to explicitly include e-cigarettes. This will reduce incidents of passengers attempting to use e-cigarettes, and will provide crew members with a specific regulation to cite in enforcing the rule. It will also put at ease passengers unfamiliar with e-cigarettes who would be alarmed by seeing their neighbor appear to “light up” (perhaps by the time this moratorium were lifted, e-cigarettes will have existed long enough so as to become commonplace). Placing a moratorium on e-cigarette usage on aircraft will not cause users significant inconvenience because alternatives exist that do not pose a health risk to third parties, such as nicotine gum and patches.
	I propose a moratorium rather than a permanent ban because I believe that to ban a product because we don't understand it is an example of policymaking based on fear. To approach scientific progress with caution by enacting a moratorium is reasonable; to condemn it with a ban is regressive. Once the moratorium is in place, the federal government should commission a scientific study of e-cigarettes and the health risks they pose to third parties. It is essential that the study be sponsored by the federal government so as to ensure the unbiased nature of its results.",,,,,,,

Long flights in cramped places can be very uncomfortable as well as stressful, especially to individuals who are addicted to nicotine. I think given the intent of part 252, which is stated in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking section as “improv[ing] air quality within the aircraft, reduce the risk of adverse health effects on passengers and crewmembers, and enhance aviation safety and passenger comfort,” the definition of “smoking” needs to be slightly altered. As the Department of Transportation as well as the FDA are currently unaware of sufficient studies on the possible health impacts on third parties who come in contact with these vapors as well as the effects on air quality within a confined space such as an aircraft, the ban of electronic cigarettes should be passed. However, if valid studies should emerge that show there are no adverse effects of these vapors to third parties or to the air quality then e-cigarettes should be allowed. 
Therefore, I think the wording should be changed to include “harmful vapor,” instead of just vapor. With regards to the word “harmful,” the e-cigarette should be proven to be NON-toxic before it can be used, as opposed to having to prove that it is in fact harmful before it is banned. If there is no danger to the welfare of passengers by the use of electronic cigarettes they should not be banned simply because they supply nicotine to the users. However, since the effects of the vapor is not known, the wording of the definition of “smoking” should allow room for change if the vapor is found to be non-harmful to third parties who may come in contact with the second-hand vapor.

Since there is no fire or smoke, the use of an e-cigarette is not the equivalent of smoking & should not be treated as such; and is on par with an inhaler.
Further research on the part of DOT, along with valid analysis of same, would seem to be in order prior to taking any action regarding this issue.
In this case, the law passed by Congress is 49 USC Section 41706. It states, ""An individual may not smoke in an aircraft.” Full text of law: 49 U.S.C. § 41706 : US Code - Section 41706: Prohibitions against smoking on scheduled flights

Currently, the regulations in Part 252 do not exceed what is authorized by law. The DOT cannot redefine what ""smoking"" means, they need to go back to Congress to have the law changed, and then they can enforce this ridiculous rule.
Until such time, any change that is attempted to be enforced is a violation of government law and I will exercise my right as a US citizen to seek court ruling in this matter.

Not only is it unknown whether or not there are health risks associated with the “second hand smoke” emitted from electronic cigarettes, there is also little consensus on the negative effects it has on the user. A recent sampling done by the FDA illustrates the possible danger of this product. Low levels of carcinogens were found in the electronic cigarettes and in one case, diethylene glycol (a poisonous toxicant) was found in an electronic cigarette (Westenberger, 2009). Since there isn’t convincing evidence that the exhaled vapor from electronic cigarettes are not harmful to people’s health, it is completely reasonable to amend part 252 to include the use of electronic “smoking” devices. However, if further research is conducted and all of the evidence points towards electronic cigarettes having no adverse effects due to the exhalation of nicotine vapors, then the proposed rule should be repealed and individuals should have the ability to use them.

In addition I would like to add that aside from the typical nicotine extract and propylene glycol dispersant often used in these e-cigarettes, there are far more dangerous applications of them that are very difficult to detect and which potentially pose an even greater hazard to public health in the enclosed space of a pressurized cabin.  For instance, the research chemical JWH-018 created to serve as a synthetic form of marijuana (originally marketed under the name “Marinol”amongst many other names and amongst various similarly constructed analogue compounds of JWH-018 used to get around regulatory bans) can be and often is extracted into liquid form and can actually replace the nicotine cartridge in an e-cigarette.   Because of the vaporized form of ingestion through the atomizer in the e-cigarette, there is no (or very little) telltale smell to determine that someone is vaporizing a synthetic cannibinoid rather than a nicotine extract.  Passengers in the pressurized environment of an aircraft cabin may be secondhand exposed to a product known to cause psychosis, panic attacks, heart palpitations, and who knows what else because these extracts are often made overseas in designer drug labs which go completely unregulated and unstudied.  There is also nothing stopping drug manufacturers from synthetically deriving liquid extracts of other dangerous drugs for use in these e-cigarette devices, such as amphetamines, which can then also be vaporized and consumed in a way that is difficult to detect.  The potential to expose these chemicals to an unwilling audience in an aircraft through an e-cigarette or other vaporizer is very real as their popularity in street use continues to grow and so prompt action from the department is warranted in this instance.",,,,,,,

Electronic cigarettes are designed so that the vapor that is released when a user exhales contains no toxins and thus will not be harmful to bystanders. While they may have been designed this way, I know that they may not always work this way, which is why I feel it is important that more research is done on the effects of electronic cigarettes on both users and second parties. This would ensure that the rule is not unequally affecting the freedom of choice for some users, which can result in contention. It has been noted that the health affects and safety of electronic cigarettes have not been verified; therefore the banning of electronic cigarettes would be based on an assumption rather than fact. Instead, an interim period in which e-cigarettes may be banned while research is done seems more appropriate. The health of all passengers is the number one priority here and you can never be too cautious in how you go about protecting it, yet freedom of choice is also an important value in the U.S. Taking away the right to use electronic cigarettes that are in fact safe to other passengers, would be akin to banning the use of IPods on planes because a second party does not want to hear their neighbors music. This is clearly an important issue that deserves more research and attention so that a final decision is reached that is uncontestable.   ",,,,,,,

Although they are advertised to be a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes there has been little to no research conducted to justify manufacturer claims to prove their validity. The FDA has conducted a preliminary analysis on samples from the two leading E-cigarette brands; although the findings were through the DPA the analysis was and is not exuberant enough to draw conclusions from. With that being said some DPA findings do stir up some concern, discovering certain tobacco-specific nitrosamines (which are human carcinogens) have been detected in half of the samples tested. E-cigarettes may contain many ingredients that are unsafe and harmful to humans, but since no clinical studies have been submitted to the FDA about the safety and efficiency of E-cigarettes consumers have no way of knowing whether these products are safe, what concentration levels or types of potentially hazardous chemicals are in these products and how much nicotine is being delivered when users are inhaling the vapor. After reading an article titled “Electronic Cigarettes: Are They Safe?” from CBS’ website they interviewed Dr. Jonathan Whiteson from NYU's Cardiac and Pulmonary Wellness and Rehabilitation Program, during his interview he emphasized greatly that lack of regulation on E-cigarettes gives buyers no knowledge whether or not the product is safe. Due to the unknown of E-cigarettes one can only further agree that it would be untimely to allow passengers on air planes to use this form of nicotine consumption. Reason being that E-cigarettes are not backed by the FDA and non-using passengers would unwillingly be exposed to potentially harmful chemicals in an enclosed space but alternative forms of nicotine are available that are FDA approved and noninvasive to others.

The Department’s note that electronic cigarettes do expel chemicals into the air that are unknown or the effects of which are unstudied and that there are issues with quality control that could lead to unsafe situations for other passengers provides particularly strong grounds for the argument that it would be unwise to presently permit them. However, the fact that the main reason provided for banning these fake cigarettes is the lack of information about their impact on health leads me to think the Department should refrain from banning them as well. I think a temporary non-admittance of electronic cigarettes until further studies have been conducted is the most logical action to take in these circumstances. In addition to this general opinion on the proposed rule, I would like to share a few comments addressing the comments requested by the Department on whether the definition of ‘smoking’ in the proposed rule is too broad and on concerns over the proposal to clarify the prohibition in Part 252 to explicitly cover cigarettes. 
According to the language of 49 U.S.C. 41706, it does not seem apparent that electronic cigarettes are already banned. The use of the term “smoking” is ambiguous. As used here, the term ‘smoking’ seems to have the built-in notion of the significant known negative consequences of typical, non-electronic types of smoking, such as harmful second-hand smoke released into the air. In addition, built into it is the idea of how the mechanics of smoking works, such as what is inhaled, exhaled and released, and how. If these notions were not built into the term, the reason for the prohibition in aircraft would be completely unclear.

The law ''Prohibitions Against Smoking on Scheduled Flights'' 49 U.S.C. 41706 does not authorize DOT to ban use of electronic cigarettes. The law states, ""An individual may not smoke in an aircraft.""  E-cigarettes produce vapor, not smoke. Therefore Section 41706 does not apply to using e-cigarettes.

E-cigarettes do not contain harmful ingredients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's tests did not find any harmful chemicals in the vapor. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/ScienceResearch/UCM173250.pdf.  Dr. Murray Laugesen of Health New Zealand conducted studies in 2008 and declared the vapor ""harmless, inhaled or exhaled.""  Drs. Zachary Cohen and Michael Siegel reviewed 16 toxicology studies of e-cigarette liquid and vapor and concluded, ""a preponderance of the available evidence shows them to be much safer than tobacco cigarettes and comparable in toxicity to conventional nicotine replacement products. http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/centers-institutes/population-development/files/article.jphp.pdf
E-cigarettes do not harm bystanders.  Since those who inhale the vapor directly are reporting their health has improved, it defies belief that the residual vapor they exhale could possibly harm bystanders.  Commercial artificial smoke generators used in aviation emergency training produce cannot be compared to exhaled e-cigarette vapor. They produce a continuous, thick, dense smoke, but e-cigarette vapor is thin and dissipates quickly. http://www.bullexsafety.com/smoke_generator.aspx?gclid=CNiayLrFhKwCFYSK4AodKlMl9Q

3. The proposed fines of $2,300 and $3,200 for being caught vaping are unreasonable and excessive.

6. The regulation is unenforceable because e-cigarette users leave behind no evidence (ash, cigarette butt, etc.) of their use. Moreover, e-cigarette users can have an e-cigarette in their mouth without using it.
 
7. Most airliners already ban the use of electronic cigarettes, and passengers who knowingly disobey an order from a flight attendant to stop using a device (whether an e-cigarette, an iPad, or a cell phone) can be charged for not obeying a lawful order under the Patriot Act.""

As a frequent flyer across the nation, I have used my device discreetly though out many airports, and many flights. Never once has anyone complained, or said anything besides simply asking questions about it, and wanting information so they can get one for themselves, or for a relative.
By allowing the use of an electronic cigarette to be used on flights it makes flying much more pleasant for everyone. The person in need of the device is not stressed out, and in turn is much better company to be around.

I have been smoke free since December 2009. While I do not use e-cigs on planes when I travel, I think that the proposed ban serves no real purpose. 

All of the research to date suggests that e-cigs are orders of magnitude safer than combustible cigarettes.   The harm associated with smoking is due to the smoke from combustion. There is no firsthand or second hand smoke from PVs because there is no combustion. The vapor from PVs is comparable to fog from a fog machine. There is no side stream smoke and no evidence that the vapor is any more dangerous to bystanders than that caused by people wearing too much perfume.  

In fact, all evidence to date shows that the low health risks associated with electronic cigarettes are comparable to other smokeless nicotine products and experts have reported that there should be no significant risk to bystanders. This is supported by research done by Dr. Siegel of Boston University, Dr. Eissenberg of Virginia Commonwealth and Dr. Laugesen of Health New Zealand and by the fact that testing by the  FDA, press releases notwithstanding, failed to find harmful levels of carcinogens or toxic levels of any chemical in the vapor from e-cigs.

I never ever heard someone say that when I smoked cigarettes once upon a time. This invention has truly helped my life and now is helping my family around me feel better and quit smoking too.",,,,,,,

The law ''Prohibitions Against Smoking on Scheduled Flights'' 49 U.S.C. 41706 does not authorize DOT to ban use of electronic cigarettes. The law states, ""An individual may not smoke in an aircraft.""  E-cigarettes produce vapor, not smoke, so Section 41706 does not apply to using e-cigarettes. The DOT has failed to produce any evidence that users of e-cigarettes or bystanders have been harmed; so 49 U.S.C. 41702 does not apply. 

E-cigarettes do not contain harmful ingredients, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's tests did not find any harmful chemicals in the vapor. A 2008 study by Dr. Murray Laugesen of Health New Zealand declared the vapor ""harmless, inhaled or exhaled."" Drs. Zachary Cohen and Michael Siegel from Harvard reviewed 16 toxicology studies of e-cigarette liquid and vapor and concluded, ""a preponderance of the available evidence shows them to be comparable in toxicity to conventional nicotine replacement products.  

My health has improved dramatically since quitting smoking. This is the same propylene glycol used in asthma medications. Liquids used in commercial smoke generators by aviation include a mixture of glycols that produces a continuous dense fog that may be irritating to eyes and airways, while e-cigarettes use USP grade pg and/or vg in a vapor that is thin and dissipates quickly.

A fine of up to $3,300 for using an e-cigarette is excessive and unwarranted because vapor is not smoke.  
The 8th Amendment to the U.S. Government prohibits the government from imposing excessive bail, fines, or cruel and unusual punishments.

Again, I respectfully request that the Department of Transportation withdraw this proposed amendment.

Smoking means the smoking of tobacco products or use of electronic

substances to a user in the form of a vapor. It does not include the 
use of a device such as a nebulizer that delivers a medically

Electronic Cigarettes do not burn any 'matter'. They use water, FDA food flavorings, nicotine (when chosen, but not always), and the main ingredient of Propylene Glycol.  So, what's propylene glycol?  Well, first it's the pharmaceudical grade, not like the kind used by the airlines to de-ice planes.  It's cleaner, purer and deemed safe for human consumption by the FDA.  It may be brought before the courts if the airlines ban them because of safety issues.  Water is not unsafe, food flavoring is not unsafe, propylene glycol is not unsafe, and nicotine (should the user want it) is in most of the vegetables and some of the fruits we eat everyday!  What's left?  Lithium batteries?  Well, lithium batteries are used in our cell phones brought on board and also our iPads and laptops.

As has been shown since the study published in 1942 by the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital, the main ingredient in an electronic cigarette, propylene glycol may prevent pneumonia, influenza, and other respiratory diseases.  CABIN CREW SHOULD not only be HAPPY when someone is using an electronic cigarette in the cabin, as it is sterilizing the very air the vapor touches, but worrying about any toxicity is not necessary.  Science has shown that Propylene glycol is used professionally by manufacturers of consumer and industrial products, but it is not available to consumers as pure substance. Under normal conditions it is therefore impossible to ingest propylene glycol in large amounts.

If you research the past few years of comments on the Electronic Cigarette Forum, the largest Forum of any kind, on line (which can not be corrected or deleted without a noticeable changing of dates),  you can see that there have been many users of electronic cigarettes that have noticed the fact that they have not been sick during normal cold and flu seasons... some -for years now!

Let's not ban something that science has shown is not bad after all.",,,,,,,

I feel this ban is completely arbitrary and lacking a proper foundation or argument justifying it. If anything, premature as there has yet been no indication that the use of E-Cigs are in any way detrimental to third parties. I would say that there are private interests driving this push against this new product, however speculation is not sufficient.

My greatest concern is what this move represents in the grander scheme of things. Here we have a product which is an excellent replacement for actual cigarettes. I myself have been a smoker for a substantial period of time, quitting never worked for me. Perhaps this was due to the potency of the product or personal faults. Regardless, thanks to E Cigarettes I do not even think about real cigarettes.. Since stopping, I have lost weight, began running, saved money, and overall improved my level of wellness. 

Of course, this last paragraph begs the question of relevance, what will a ban of flights detract from the benefits I currently derive. The answer is that it is one more action in a litany of legislation seeking to ban the use of this product. It set precedent and strengthens the force of any other moves to ban E Cigarettes.

This product is harmless to the public, we have not proven otherwise. Until than there is no reasonable justification for the actions that are being taken. Whatever the motivation may be for such legislation the final product will, at least for me result in me returning to a less healthy state in all probability. This in however is likely to increase costs and harm to the public, as my poor health may end up costing the public. 

This is not a fair action, or a logical one. Whatever the issue may be I urge you to reconsider as this product has been of great help to my family, many friends, and myself.",,,,,,,

Since the vapor from e-cigarettes does not produce harmful chemicals the way cigarettes do they cannot be compared in any meaningful manner. The burning of tobacco leaves produce over 4000 chemicals whereas vaporizing glycerin or propylene glycol has shown to produce absolutely no chemicals whatsoever. 

There are also some sticky legal issues with your proposal as well, to wit:

1..The DOT has failed to cite any evidence that e-cigarettes pose a threat to bystanders..There exists, however, plenty of evidence that e-cigarette vapor produces no toxic substances whatsoever.

2..The DOT's regulation is contrary to federal law. The DOT only has the authority to regulate ""smoking"". E-cigarette use is not smoking.

3..The proposed fines of $2,300 and $3,200 for being caught “vaping” are unreasonable and excessive.

4..The DOT claims that it has always considered e-cigarette use to be ""smoking,"" but despite there likely having been tens of thousands of people using e-cigarettes on planes in the past half-decade, not a single e-cigarette user has been charged with smoking.

5..Millions of anecdotal stories, including mine, support the scientific evidence that e-cigarette usage is not only a safe alternative to tobacco use, it helps smokers quit as well, unlike the ineffective methods promoted by the pharmaceutical industry.

Please be sure to check the science as well as all the stories of healthier ex-smokers whose lives have been saved by e-cigarettes. Ask doctors who are overjoyed that their patients have stopped their use of tobacco. Make a sensible and informed decision. Once you have seen the science and the results in actual human lives, you can only conclude that e-cigarette use poses no threat public health or safety and in fact will improve health and safety for ex-smokers and the general public as well.

Just come out and say you don't like the product, or would that be too easy for all to understand?

...................................................................................

Nitrogen: 20–90%
Hydrogen: 0–50%
Carbon dioxide: 10–30%
Oxygen: 0–10%
Methane: 0–10%

Because the methane, hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen present are flammable, igniting the resulting gases can result in burns or explosions as well as the desired flame. Clothing, hair or skin may catch fire and sensitive tissues can be damaged.

....................................................................................

There is as much chance of E-cigarette vapor harming someone as there is flatulence causing a fire, or the resultant chemicals having adverse affects on anyone coming in contact with it. So where are the regulations??? Come on, we need the fart police to start riding our airways!!!

Your regulations has nothing to do with health issues, but is instead rooted in power and need to regulate every aspect of our lives...to justify your existence.

I have quit smoking cigarettes...a smoker of 45 years who has tried EVERYTHING to quit, and 6 months ago found e-cigs and have not touched a cigarette since. My doctor is amazed at the results I have reached, with blood pressure going down to normal, my lungs have cleared completely, and all other aspects of my general health have improved dramatically! But that doesn't matter, does it, no...anything the L O O K S !!!!!!

I would hope that you reconsider this ban proposal.  I was a heavy smoker of 42 years and after having open heart surgey and trying ever available method to stop smoking (none successful) I finally was directed to e cigarette by my heart surgeon.  I have now been smoke free for over 8 months.  The e cigarette that I use allows me to ween myself off of nicotine slowly.  I know that most of the smoking is habit and it allowed me to replace a very bad nasty habit with one that my family, friends and co workers find as not bother to them.  I have used my e cigarette on two flights with permission of attendants and found that no one around me found it offensive, in fact several people asked if it worked and after hearing my story several took cards with a place to order the kit for either them or a family member.  No I am not part of the company just a very satisfied customer and my doctor says I am doing very good, infact I have been able to stop some of the medications that I had to take.  Please don't make it hard for other people o get the same success that I have had.

There are other things that bother me a lot more than nicotine or caffeine and I feel they should be banned also. Flatulent s and halitosis are much more a health issue than the vapor from E-cigarettes. Flatulent's produce methane, a very flammable gas that has serious health risks if inhaled. Halitosis is caused by bacteria in the mouth and if an odor is produced than that bacteria is airborn and could be contaminating the entire aircraft.

The DOT has not provided any evidence that bystanders are in any way affected by people using an electronic cigarette. In fact, a person can use an electronic cigarette with no external evidence of its use other than the LED light turning on -- i.e., no vapor released into the air, no smell, nothing.

I am also concerned that the DOT is overstepping its authority, as it has the right to regulate ""smoking,"" but the use of an electronic cigarette is NOT smoking, as there is no flame or burning involved.

Finally, there is the problem of enforcement. I often like to put my electronic cigarette in my mouth as a soothing habit, even when I am not using it. Further, there is no ""evidence of use"" -- that is, no ash or cigarette butt left behind. Claims of use could turn into silly he-said, she-said situations for no reason, given that nothing is being released and no bystander is being affected. This could lead to great uncertainty and confusion, which is the last thing we need on airplanes.

    The law states, ""An individual may not smoke in an aircraft.""
    E-cigarettes produce vapor, not smoke.

    Since those who inhale the vapor directly are reporting their health has improved, it defies belief that the residual vapor they exhale could possibly harm bystanders.

I started to taste and smell again and my wheezing bronchial health problems began to clear up and now I am able to ride a bicycle for 20 miles without much fuss and I am 58 years old. Real cigarettes that burns tobacco, have over 4,000 cancer causing chemicals to produce the smoke and carry the nicotine to the nicotine user and passive users.  They can burn down homes and be stinky and a filthy mess.  With an e-cigarette there is no fire hazard, no disgusting ash and stinky tar, carbon monoxide and all the other poisons that are causing passive smokers and smokers themselves to die of cancer and other respiratory ailments.  The UK Cabinet Office Behavioural Insights Team has confirmed this viewpoint in their recent statement that they believe use of electronic cigarettes should be promoted, not banned.
Even the FDA failed to find harmful levels of carcinogens or toxic levels of any chemical in the vapor.  Please do not spread false fears and untrue data about e-cigarettes, this could prevent millions and millions of smokers from finding this safe alternative.  It should be applauded not banned.

The vapor that is exhaled is odorless and harmless, and dissipates immediately.   Most cartridges contain only nicotine, propylene glycol, sugar alcohol, and artificial flavoring.

What's more, if there is any ""confusion"", the e-cigarette can quickly and easily be unscrewed to prove to anyone who is blind enough to confuse it with a tobacco cigarette, that this is something different.  

There is no basis for this law in any kind of medical fact, and it is just one more way to demonize people.   What's next?   Banning asthma inhalers on airplanes?   It's the same principle, after all:  people surrounding the user might be worried about the ingredients that are exhaled!

The amount of the proposed fine(s) is extremely excessive, indicating a complete lack of understanding of the devices, and makes an offense on par with cigarette smoking. Since there is no fire or smoke, the use of an e-cigarette is not the equivalent of smoking & should not be treated as such; it is on par with an inhaler.

Further research on the part of DOT, along with valid analysis of same, would seem to be in order prior to taking any action regarding this issue.

In this case, the law passed by Congress is 49 USC Section 41706. It states, ""An individual may not smoke in an aircraft.” Full text of law: 49 U.S.C. § 41706 : US Code - Section 41706: Prohibitions against smoking on scheduled flights

DOT created regulations to enforce this law. These are stored in the Code of Federal Regulations: 14 CFR Part 252.

Currently, the regulations in Part 252 do not exceed what is authorized by law. The DOT cannot redefine what ""smoking"" means, they need to go back to Congress to have the law changed, and then they can enforce this ridiculous rule.
Until such time, any change that is attempted to be enforced is a violation of government law and I will exercise my right as a US citizen to seek court ruling in this matter.",,,,,,,

The law ''Prohibitions Against Smoking on Scheduled Flights'' 49 U.S.C. 41706 does not in any way authorize DOT to ban use of electronic cigarettes.

The aforementioned law states, ""An individual may not smoke in an aircraft."" and it is important to note that E-Cigarettes do not produce smoke of any kind. The output of an E-Cigarette is vapor, which is quite similar to the steam which is produced when boiling water for tea. By virtue of the fact that E-Cigarettes do not produce smoke by combustion,  Section 41706 does not, and most certainly should not, apply to using E-Cigarettes. 

Further, E-cigarettes do not contain harmful ingredients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has performed exhaustive tests on these products and failed to find any harmful chemicals in the vapor. http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/ScienceResearch/UCM173250.pdf

A few helpful definitions: 

Definition of Smoke: A visible suspension of carbon or other particles in air, typically one emitted from a burning substance.

Definition of Steam: The vapor into which water is converted when heated, forming a white mist of minute water droplets in the air. 

Definition of Smoking: Inhale and exhale the smoke of tobacco. 

In light of these facts, which hopefully help to clarify that Smoke and Steam Vapor are not the same substance, and that the intent of 49 U.S.C. 41706 is to prevent Smoking, or the combustion of Cigarettes aboard Scheduled Flights, I once again request that DOT withdraw the proposed amendment to 14 CFR Part 252.

Thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to voice my request.

J.","Morning","Springfield","VA","22153","United States",,,,,,,"Tobacco cigarettes have been banned in almost every public place throughout the US and abroad primarily for two reasons: 

First, the evidence, proven scientifically, that tobacco smoke is harmful to people. We have enough data to confirm this, so the numerous public bans - regardless of their actual effect on public health - are not without reason. 

Second is the fact that many non-smokers simply object to being within sight of anyone smoking a cigarette. It is deemed unhealthy and ""bad,"" and even if the smoke is nowhere near the non-smoker, it's still considered a problem. Non-smokers, with the help of the pharmaceutical industry (which reaps billions of dollars every year selling ""stop smoking"" drugs in pill and patch and gum forms), have made smoking a social taboo. 

As it applies to electronic cigarettes, the first concern at hand - that being public health - has not been evaluated by any legitimate public health agency. The FDA has conducted studies on e-cigarette vapor since 2003, and so far has yet to find anything more harmful than wearing a nicotine transdermal patch. We have no reason to think exhaled vapor from e-cigarettes is harmful to anyone, so... we're banning it anyway? 

Which brings us back to point number two: Few non-smokers have any idea what e-cigarettes are, what is inside them (though many vendors list all ingredients on their websites), and automatically think ""oh, it's a cigarette, so that person is doing something bad and needs to be banned."" 

This appears to be more of a problem involving public perception than actual public health, and it would seem irresponsible of the government to ban a product which serves as a much less harmful replacement for tobacco cigarettes. 

A far more prudent move would be to stay any decisions involving e-cigarette bans, until the FDA provides a clearer indication of any actual impact of the exhaled vapor on public health. ",,,,,,,

I just don't understand why you feel you must impose such horrific fines and regulations on this healthy alternative to smoking, especially since these fines were never imposed on smokers to this degree.  How do you feel it is within your jurisdiction to oversee this issue?  This is definitely NOT SMOKING, and POSES NO THREAT TO BYSTANDERS.

The rule seeks to prohibit something that is, arguably, a manifest goal of anti-smoking groups, presuming that goal is to eliminate tobacco smoking. If the reasoning behind a ban on smoking tobacco products on a plane is to prevent secondhand smoke injuries & complaints, and also to prevent creating an uncomfortable environment for fellow passengers, this rule does not achieve those ends. However, electronic cigarettes were designed to assist smokers in smoking cessation, and also to allow smokers who do not wish to quit to have the ability to facilitate a personal choice without disturbing those in their vicinity. The byproduct of electronic cigarettes is water vapor, which is literally no worse than the combined exhalations of a full passenger jet. Further, this rule seeks to prohibit one harmless byproduct, with no consideration of any other, actually harmful byproduct; an individual with a minor upper respiratory tract infection, who spends the flight coughing, is sending vast quantities of particulates into the air, possibly infecting and sickening others - yet there is no rule against flying when sick. An individual with a child who refuses to quiet down, and cries incessantly throughout the flight could be damaging to fellow passengers ears and mental health - but there is no rule against flying with children under age 6. Similarly, this rule does not actually serve any purpose, and only serves to appease those individuals who would ignorantly claim that it bothers them. It is justifiable only when rules are implemented that regulate personal hygiene, parenting behaviors, and like. Meanwhile, it deprives those individuals who did the homework, and made the switch to electronic cigarettes, knowing that there are ZERO effects to persons not consuming the electronic cigarette.",,,,,,,

The law ''Prohibitions Against Smoking on Scheduled Flights'' 49 U.S.C. 41706 does not authorize DOT to ban use of electronic cigarettes.  The law states, ""An individual may not smoke in an aircraft.""; E-cigarettes produce vapor, not smoke, therefore Section 41706 does not apply to using e-cigarettes.

The preponderance of evidence suggests that E-cigarettes do not contain nor produce harmful ingredients/byproducts.

Also a fine of $3,300 for using an e-cigarette is excessive and unwarranted; vapor is not smoke.  There is no combustion nor production of any harmful byproducts.  

DOT has failed to produce any evidence that users of e-cigarettes or bystanders have been harmed; therefore 49 U.S.C. 41702 does not apply to the use of e-cigarettes.  The 8th Amendment to the U.S. Government prohibits the government from imposing excessive bail, excessive fines, or cruel or unusual punishments.

There is no combustion and you cannot have smoke without combustion, so the entire concept of the DOT's proposed regulation is uninformed and seriously flawed from the beginning.

The plan that the DOT has to make the use of electronic cigarettes illegal on flights is ridiculous. There has been no evidence that electronic cigarettes pose any threat to public health and they are not ""smoking"" devices so I don't see that the DOT even has the authority to regulate them in the first place.

I personally use electronic cigarettes in lieu of smoking tobacco and it has made a huge difference in my life. After over a year of trying to quit with gum and patches, I tried an electronic cigarette and have not had a single cigarette since the first day. I am now 8 months smoke-free.

Please drop this proposed regulation as it will only add to an unnecessarily negative perception of electronic cigarettes in the public mind. There are too many cigarette smoker's lives at risk to continue this negative attack on electronic cigarettes. This is a device that is ultimately for the public good and will save lives.

Unless & until DOT can cite harm or threat to those with casual contact to e-cigarette vapor, legality of use is not an issue within DOT purview.

The amount of the proposed fine(s) is extremely excessive, indicating a complete lack of understanding of the devices, and makes an offense on par with cigarette smoking. Since there is no fire or smoke, the use of an e-cigarette is not the equivalent of smoking & should not be treated as such; it is on par with an inhaler.

Further research on the part of DOT, along with valid analysis of same, would seem to be in order prior to taking any action regarding this issue.

In this case, the law passed by Congress is 49 USC Section 41706. It states, ""An individual may not smoke in an aircraft.” Full text of law: 49 U.S.C. § 41706 : US Code - Section 41706: Prohibitions against smoking on scheduled flights

DOT created regulations to enforce this law. These are stored in the Code of Federal Regulations: 14 CFR Part 252.

Currently, the regulations in Part 252 do not exceed what is authorized by law. The DOT cannot redefine what ""smoking"" means, they need to go back to Congress to have the law changed.

It is my view and experience that second-hand smoke is detrimental and unpleasant. However, since electronic cigarettes emit water vapor, and it allows smokers to take a step toward quitting, I believe they should be allowed on commercial flights. 

The original impetus behind prohibiting cigarettes on airplanes being in large part being the prevention of health problems related to second-hand smoke, the prohibition should have no effect on electronic cigarettes, whether or not they emit water vapor.

Were the prohibition to be extended to electronic cigarettes, the only government justification for it would be to discourage smoking of actual cigarettes in contexts other than on airplanes. This is not a legitimate government interest in a free society. 

In conclusion, absent a showing that emitted water vapor from electronic cigarettes negatively effects the interior of airplanes, such cigarettes should be allowed on airplanes because the justifications for outlawing regular cigarettes do not support a prohibition on electronic cigarettes.

Thus far, the scientific literature has not demonstrated that electronic cigarettes are risk-free. The FDA evaluated the devices in 2009 and found them to contain nicotine, propylene glycol, and diethylene glycol. The battery-powered heater vaporizes these chemicals to be inhaled by the user. While these products are marketed to consumers as an alternative to smoking that can satisfy cravings without the health risk, these claims have not been substantiated. The fact that tobacco specific nitrosamines, tobacco specific impurities, and diethylene glycol were found in these devices raises concerns about the health effects they may pose. Even products advertised as nicotine-free were found to have nicotine. While there was a study that didn’t find a measurable amount of nicotine or carbon monoxide in blood plasma when two brands of electronic cigarettes were tested, long-term consequences to the user and health effects of those in close proximity are still unknown. While these devices may really be a better alternative than tobacco cigarettes, the science does not yet warrant its use in confined spaces where exposure may present health concerns.

Electronic cigarette vapor (not smoke) is 90% composed of the same chemical used to clean the recirculated air in an airplane - propylene glycol. I know this because I make my own electronic cigarette liquid. Only trace amounts of nicotine are released upon exhale, because only trace amounts of nicotine are in the original solution. There are no studies suggesting negative health effects of first or second hand vaporizing. If there were, people would not be allowed the use of a prescription nicotine inhaler on a plane either.. which contains the same solution as what is being proposed to be banned. I believe the issue is that personal nicotine vaporizers are associated with cigarette smoking far more than gums, patches and nicotine inhalers because it looks like smoking. This is very superficial reasoning to move forward with this ban.. my two cents. Please do your research.",,,,,,,

Summary: I submit this comment in support of banning the use of electronic cigarettes on airplanes.  A ban on electronic cigarettes falls within the spirit of the statutory scheme set forth by 49 U.S.C. 41706, 49 U.S.C. 41702, and 14 CFR part 252.  The purpose of these statutes is to provide passengers with safe and adequate airplane travel, to improve air quality within the aircraft, and to “reduce the risk of adverse health effects on passengers and crewmembers. Banning the use of electronic cigarettes on airplanes furthers these legislative goals because of the dangers posed by nicotine vapors.

At one point, the NPRM notes, “We are unaware of sufficient studies on the health impact on third parties from these vapors to conclude that they would not negatively impact the air quality within the aircraft and/or increase the risk of adverse health effects on passengers and crewmembers.”  Based on this language, the DOT is simply assuming that electronic cigarettes are unsafe because there have not been studies suggesting that they are safe.  
	The DOT is exceeding its jurisdiction by challenging the underlying safety of electronic cigarettes themselves.  In doing so, the DOT is aggrandizing itself into the jurisdiction of other agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration.  The DOT cites one paper that admits the “safety of inhaling propylene glycol has not been studied in humans,” and then goes on to state that because electronic cigarette cartridges can leak, they should be removed from the market.  The DOT is charged with protecting the air quality of aircrafts’ cabins and the safety of those aboard the aircraft, not with regulating the sale of consumer products.  
	The DOT admits that electronic cigarettes have become increasingly prevalent in recent years and are largely marketed as capable of being used in places where traditional cigarettes are banned.  The sale of electronic cigarettes represents almost a $100 million industry in the United States.  In proposing to ban electronic cigarettes, the DOT is not sufficiently considering the needs of nicotine-addicted individuals in the US as well as the impact on an industry that may depend on the legal use of its product aboard aircraft. 
	The American Association of Public Health Physicians supports electronic cigarettes.  According to the Association, ""A cigarette smoker can reduce his or her risk of fut",,,,,,,

I Respectfully request that the Department of Transportation withdraw the proposed amendment to  14 CFR Part 252  that would prohibit use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) on aircraft. 
The law ''Prohibitions Against Smoking on Scheduled Flights'' 49 U.S.C. 41706 does not authorize DOT to ban use of electronic cigarettes. 
The law states, ""An individual may not smoke in an aircraft."" 
E-cigarettes produce vapor, not smoke. 
Therefore Section 41706 does not apply to using e-cigarettes.

Nothing is lit and no smoke is created for anyone else to inhale. They only emit a small amount of vaporized water that immediately dissipates and poses no health risk to others.

They are called electronic cigarettes solely for marketing purposes. 

Barring their use on aircraft is another major step towards a total ban for a product that has been proven incredibly effective in having smokers dramatically reduce their cigarette consumption and, often, allowing them to eliminate cigarettes entirely. 

There have been no studies that even hint that vaporizing is harmful to others.

I would like to refer you to the article: ""A Tool to Quit Smoking Has Some Unlikely Critics"" by John Tierney that was published in the New York Times on November 7, 2011. In the article many prominent doctors and anti-smoking activists praise vaporizing as a positive alternative to smoking.

In Britain, the Royal College of Physicians has denounced “irrational and immoral” regulations inhibiting the introduction of safer nicotine-delivery devices.""

and

""“E-cigarettes could replace much or most of cigarette consumption in the U.S. in the next decade,” said William T. Godshall, the executive director of Smokefree Pennsylvania. His group has previously campaigned for higher cigarette taxes, smoke-free public places and graphic warnings on cigarette packs, but he now finds himself at odds with many of his former allies over the question of e-cigarettes.

“There is no evidence that e-cigarettes have ever harmed anyone, or that youths or nonsmokers have begun using the product,” Mr. Godshall said. On a scale of harm from 1 to 100, where nicotine gums and lozenges are 1 and cigarettes are 100, he estimated that e-cigarettes are no higher than 2. ""

Please consider the facts.

Thank you,

The nature of the Department's proposed rulemaking is an interpretation of the statutory language of 49 U.S.C. 41706.  In the proposal, the Department views its current regulatory ban on smoking of tobacco products to be sufficiently broad to include the use of e-cigarettes.  Viewing the proposal as an agency interpreting its own rule, the Department may invoke the benefit of the Auer deference and there is little doubt that its interpretation is controlling since it is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.  However, in amending the regulation, the Department proposes to supplement the original phrase ""smoking of tobacco products"" with ""use of electronic cigarettes that are designed to deliver nicotine or other substances to a user in the form of a vapor,"" which seems to state that e-cigarettes do not fall into tobacco products.  In addition, in the proposal the Department mentions that ""we view the statutory ban on smoking in section 41706 to cover electronic cigarettes as the statutory authority for this NPRM,"" which indicates that this proposal is more of a reinterpretation of the statutory language.  Therefore, the proposal would be subject to the Chevron-Mead deference.  According to the statutory language of 49 U.S.C. 41706, it is clear that Congress intends to delegate to the Department the authority to make rules that carry the force of law and has not explicitly defined ""smoking"".  So the only potential attack to the Department's position is that it may be an impermissible construction of the statutory language.

The Department's new definition of ""smoking"" is very broad and may go beyond the permissive construction of 49 U.S.C. 41706.  The Department proposes to prohibit use",,,,,,,

DOT-OST-2011-0044

If subject to judicial review, the Department of Transportation’s proposed rulemaking regarding the explicit ban on use of electronic cigarettes contains some issues under Chevron.  

I)	Definition of “Smoking” 

DOT may fail under the first Chevron inquiry regarding its definition of “smoking.” (Initially I note that Chevron applies to DOT’s rulemaking. See United States v. Mead, 533 U.S. 218, 226-277 (2001) (asking first whether Congress intended to delegate legislative rulemaking authority). 
Has Congress has spoken clearly as to whether the use of e-cigarettes constitutes smoking? The plain language of the statute does not define smoking in specific terms. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines “smoke” as, “the gaseous products of burning materials… made visible by … small particles of carbon.” SMOKE, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/smoke (last visited Oct. 30 2011). This definition implies that smoking requires visible smoke, and therefore, not e-cigarette vapor. However, the third definition of smoke includes “fume or vapor...” Id. (emphasis added).  Thus, a reasonable interpretation of smoke might include or exclude e-cigarette vapor. The plain language is ambiguous.  
Turning to the statutory purpose, Congress clearly intended DOT to promulgate rules to prohibit smoking and provide a safe environment. See 49 U.S.C. § 41706 (2000); 49 U.S.C. § 41702 (1994). Moreover, prior to the statute’s enactment, Congress (and DOT) rejected numerous bills to regulate smoking on aircrafts and other scientific studies due to a “lack of evidence” regarding secondhand smoke indoors. A.L. Holm, R. M. Davis, Clearing the airways: advocacy and regulation for smoke free airlines, 33, http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/
13/suppl_1/ i30.full.pdf. Considering the overall statutory purpose, and the lengthy legislative history of the smoking ban, Congress probably intended to limit smoke to mean harmful smoke from cigarette",,,,,,,

I do not believe the DOT should make a rule regarding electronic cigarettes on aircraft. This should be left up to the discretion of each airline, because your proposal cites no evidence of e-cigarettes posing any safety hazard at all either to bystanders or the plane.

An e-cigarette makes vapor, not smoke. There is no combustion. It does not emit carcinogens and it does not pose an ignition risk. It isn't any different, in terms of safety, than a cup of coffee except that it poses less risk than a cup of coffee in terms of accidental burns. 

Electronic cigarettes are a very useful tool for overall tobacco harm reduction; and I believe their use should be encouraged rather than discouraged. Many physicians and physician groups agree.

Since use of an e-cigarette is NOT smoking, since it poses no risk of harm to the user, bystanders or the safety of the aircraft, and since it is a useful tool for tobacco harm reduction, I believe that rules such as what you are proposing would be overall detrimental.

The point of banning smoking is to protect the safety and wellbeing of passengers. Banning e-cigarettes would add nothing to their safety. 

Thank you for considering my comments.

Very truly,

Brett Markham",,,,,,,

As you know many are distressed about this issue of late. I felt compelled to write of my experiences and opinions in hopes that the debate will take a turn for the intellectually honest.

I believe the reason for legislation such as this stems from an unfortunate misinterpretation of terms. Equating cigarettes and electronic vapor producing products is disingenuous at best. Dictionary.com defines cigarettes as ""a cylindrical roll of finely cut tobacco cured for smoking, .. and usually wrapped in thin white paper"". Electronic vapor devices are nothing of the kind. They contain no tobacco, use no fire as a catalyst and carry none of the carcinogens normally associated with smoking. They merely vaporize liquid and no report, to my knowledge, link them to any real health hazards for either users or those in close proximity to persons utilizing them unlike their unhealthy organic ""cousins"".

As an electronic vapor producing product user for over a year, I should report that because of my use of these products, I have been able to eliminate a 30+ year habit of smoking regular cigarettes. My health has improved immeasurably. My physician has reported that my lung capacity is now that of a 55 year old (I'm 48) having only a year ago reported that of a 67yo. To say nothing of the increased sense of smell, taste and energy level. I should point out that not once has anyone exposed to my use of these products complained of my use of them. Anecdotal to be sure, but I assure you there is near consensus among my peers.

In summary, I believe that it is the governments duty to accurately frame debates. And, here, as a represented citizen, I am formally asking that you do just that.

I ask that my government reject such incorrect comparisons, sponsor tests on products that are in question, and write appropriate rules and regulations that do not inhibit freedoms, but rather, protect the rights of the individuals you have been entrusted to govern. Thank You.",,,,,,,

My mother is highly allergic to cigarette smoke. It is a relief to her that there is not smoking allowed in indoor spaces. However I can use my ecig near her without her having an allergy attack. In fact she is very glad that I use this device now. My father switched to vaping indoors around her after I switched. He still uses cigarettes occasionally, but he ""vapes""  the e-cig in his off ice now instead of having his pipe or a cigarette, with the window open the way he used to. 

This has been a great relief to my mother.

The DOT has failed to cite any evidence that e-cigarettes pose a threat to bystanders. And based on the evidence I have of using this device around non smokers and smokers alike it has NO effect on them. The smell of the vapor is usually very pleasant and it does not linger the way that cigarette smoke. It is NOT smoke in that no carcinogens are being burnt to produce it, so it is not a fire hazard. 

The proposed fines of $2,300 and $3,200 for being caught vaping are unreasonable and excessive. I personally, have never used my e-cig ina public place. But were I to this fee is even higher then seems reasonable.

This ruling also seems unnecessary as Most airliners already ban the use of electronic cigarettes, and passengers who knowingly disobey an order from a flight attendant to stop using a device (whether an e-cigarette, an iPad, or a cell phone) can be charged for not obeying a lawful order under the Patriot Act.

I fear that more laws against e-cagarrete use will make it seem as harmful or more so then Tobacco cigarettes and that i simply not the case. E-cigarettes produce less litter, have LESS harmful health risks, and additives then regular cigarettes. 

Thank you for your time.

The first & most important reason is that components in e-cigarettes raise significant health concerns.  The FDA issued a warning in 2009 that “laboratory analysis of electronic cigarette samples has found that they contain carcinogens and toxic chemicals such as diethylene glycol, an ingredient used in antifreeze.”  The World Health Organization has stated there is “no scientific evidence to confirm the product's safety & efficacy.”

Our second concern involves enforcement of the current Federal rules prohibiting smoking on aircraft.   E-cigarettes can undermine & cause confusion over compliance with smokefree rules when used on smokefree airplanes. Several airlines have prohibited their use, citing enforcement as an issue.
  
It is a common trend to prohibit the use of e-cigarettes in smokefree places.  There are at least 25 municipalities that define “smoking” to include the use of e-cigarettes, & prohibit their use in workplaces & public places.  

There is also strong public support for prohibiting the use of e-cigarettes.  A 2010 study by the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital found 69% support prohibiting the use of e-cigarettes in indoor places and workplaces. 

Without more data from recognized health authorities to prove these products are harmless to bystanders, ANR’s urges the DOT to err on the side of public health & prohibit their use on all aircraft.

Docket No. DOT-OST-2011-0044

To Whom it May Concern:

I am writing to express my support for the proposed amendment to 49 U.S.C. 41706, “Prohibitions Against Smoking on Scheduled Flights.” This amendment intends to specify that the smoking of electronic cigarettes on airplanes is prohibited along with the smoking of traditional cigarettes.

The main reason for my support of this amendment is the potential negative effects that electronic cigarettes may have on the health of “second-hand smokers” through the vapors they release. As stated in the explanation of this proposed amendment, the purpose of the prohibition of cigarettes on aircraft is to protect passengers and crew by providing clean breathing air. Any passenger or crew action that may threaten air quality on aircraft should be prohibited.

Electronic cigarettes are different than traditional cigarettes in that they release a vapor rather than smoke. I therefore suggest that the inclusion of electronic cigarettes in the smoking ban on aircraft be reviewed if significant evidence is compiled which states that electronic cigarettes do not pose a threat in the form of “second-hand smoke.” Until this sort of evidence can be compiled, I support the proposed amendment to specifically prohibit the use of electronic cigarettes on aircraft.

Thank you,

1. I am unclear why the promotion of electronic cigarettes to get smokers off of the carcinogenic tobacco cigarettes would be an issue to the DOT.

2. The public needs to be informed that there are no reported potential health issues with electronic cigarettes. There is no second=hand smoke, no burning, no combustibles, and virtually no odor.  It is completely harmless to any other passengers.

Please educate yourself before condeming electronic vaping. The term ""cigarettes"" is not accurate. These are not what the public associates with the word ""cigarette"". I have been a non-smoker since Oct 8, 2011. I only vape.",,,,,,,

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing regarding the proposed changes to DOT-OST-2011-0044 -- RIN 2105-AE06-Smoking of Electronic Cigarettes on Aircraft


1)Section 252.4 Smoking ban: air carriers, clearly articulates that “Air carriers shall prohibit smoking on all scheduled passenger flights.

	I strongly agree with this ban and suggest that it be upheld for the protection of the passengers and crewmembers and overall air quality. According to the research of G. Wieslander, D. Norbaumlck, and T. Lindgren, entitled ``Experimental exposure to propylene glycol mist in aviation emergency training: Acute ocular and respiratory effects,'' it has been shown that non-asthmatic people have who have been exposed to propylene glycol mist from artificial smoke generators may cause acute ocular and upper airway irritation and in a few cases people people reacted with cough and slight airway obstruction. Additionally, since there are design flaws in electronic cigarettes and high concerns over quality control and health related issues due to the lack of knowing impact of the ingredients on cabin air quality, the ban of electronic cigarette devices should enforced. The use of electronic cigarettes should only be approved if it can be proven to be beneficial and vital for medical reasons of an individual. 

Thank you very much for taking my recommendation into consideration.

Sincerely,

Ericka Warren, BSW

E-cigarettes are unregulated nicotine delivery devices that emit an unknown mixture of chemicals into the air. Use on an aircraft would increase the level or air pollution inside the aircraft cabin and subject passengers and flight crew to the toxic chemicals in the exhaled “vapor.”

The e-cigarette companies claim that the complex mixture of chemicals emitted is “water vapor.” Blu, an e-cigarette company, claims on their website that the white “smoke” e-cigarette smokers depicted in an aircraft cabin emit contains, “No second hand smoke only water vapor.”  (See image from the www.bluecigs.com home page, accessed November 10, 2011.) Another retailer, The Safe Cig, claims, “Our vapor is so clean that you can exhale directly into a tissue or paper towel and not see or smell a thing!” (www.thesafecig.com).

There has been no independent scientific validation of these claims.

In contrast, studies by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration scientists found that there are substances other than water contained in the vapor (FDA, 2009; Trehy et al., 2011). In a summary report of e-cigarette analyses released by FDA on their website, the products contained tobacco specific nitrosamines (NNN, NNK, NAT, NAB) that are carcinogenic, diethylene glycol, and propylene glycol.  Though few studies exist on the effects of inhaling propylene glycol, it is at minimum a mild irritant to the human respiratory tract (Sciencelab, Inc., 2010). Nicotine and related compounds, such as B-nicotyrine, anabasine, and myosmine are also present in the products (FDA, 2009; Flouris and Oikonomou, 2010; Trehy et al., 2011).  Nicotine is a neurotoxin (Abreu-Villaca et al., 2003) used as an insecticide (American Lung Association, nd).

There is no evidence that all these toxins are absorbed by the smoker.  ...

It is absolutely unacceptable for a person to use such a device in a smokefree area.  The device clearly emitted toxic substances that acted on my body as tobacco smoke does.  I was not aware the device was being used until I experienced the extreme pain and began looking for the cause of that pain.

There is no evidence that all these toxins are absorbed by the smoker.  In considering whether or not to allow this pollution source in the confined airspace of an airline cabin, the DOT should assume that at least some of these toxic chemicals will be emitted into the cabin airspace. 

When smokers go outdoors to feed their addiction we can measure nicotine in the blood stream of their children.  The damaging chemicals are adsorbed on the smoker's clothes, hair and skin.  Use of e-cigarettes on an airliner means the seats and cabin walls will be contaminated with the carcinogens reported by the FDA in 2009.  So we can all enjoy wallowing in toxic waste smeared all over our seats.

No one is going to die if people cannot use e-cigarettes on an airliner.  The onus should be on proving that the devices do not emit unhealthful chemicals into the air shared by all of the passengers.   And if they do emit unhealthful chemicals they should not be allowed.

In addition this product does include an ignition source used to heat the tobacco product, thus creating a possible safety or security hazard.

There are a half dozen other nicotine substitutes that are both discrete and non-noxious to passengers proximate to their use.

Perhaps most importantly there is a strong societal and public health message in keeping public transportation free of a highly addictive drug, nicotine.  

Please prohibit e-cigarette usage on aircraft.

E-cigarettes would likely degrade the air quality on public transportation, and should not be permitted on aircraft.  

Air travel has been made quite safe in recent decades, thanks to decades of responsible regulation.

The public does not owe it to e-cigarette proponents to act as lab rats once again for yet another questionable tobacco product simply so that users may be spared the inconvenience of respectful behaviour toward others.

The only acceptable safety standard for a non-essential recreational drug with potential to harm bystanders is conclusive proof by independent research that passive exposure to e-cigarette vapour is “as safe as or safer than not being exposed to it at all.”

Lawmakers owe it to us to ban public e-cigarette use until proponents have met this standard of proof.",,,,,,,

2) New JF Etter paper (""Saliva cotinine levels in users of electronic cigarettes"" ) concludes experienced E-cigarette users have a higher ng / mL (322 ng/mL) nicotine found in the saliva than NRT users and even tobacco users.  This may lead to overdose on the airplanes (4th point point)
 
3) If airlines begin to allow e-cigarettes on airplanes, may potentially lead to increase problems:
1) smuggling drugs -> increase watchout / checking e-cigarettes -> longer wait times to board flights;; propel dispute on why nicotine inhalers shouldn't also be allowed on planes --> all of which will cost additional time money, and effort spent on regulation 
 
4) Airplane companies face liability issues if a individual overdoses on nicotine while in flight. Overdose of users can be quoted from a number of sources online such as various e-cigarette forums
 
5) Other non-smokers have a right to be on a smokeless flight. The vapor from the e-cigarette will not dissipate quickly for all brands/models smoked, and that may make the flight uncomfortable for nearby non smokers.
 
6) E-cigarettes are a potential device for nicotine addiction, which may also lead to abuse of these products (on airlines).  If airlines support these products it may send the message that they are safe when in actuality it is still to early to tell if they are

What a drag it is to be an E-cigarette smoker
The Department of Transportation and the FDA are at war against you.

Call me crazy but I thought that when they banned passive smoking on airlines, (and every place else) I thought it was about the tobacco smoke, the killer they claim.

E-cigarettes, the ones who give off NO second hand smoke, are to be banned shortly on all airlines. Banned? Why? They give off no smoke, just water vapor.  What is wrong with a safe alternative?

According to Kenneth Cuccinelli, the Attorney General for the state of Virginia, ""In my opinion using an e-cigarette does not fall within the definition of ""smoke"" or ""smoking"".[1]

Nothing is combusted to create smoke.  So where is the fire?

It has been claimed that many contain diethylene glycol, an ingredient in anti-freeze. Shall we examine trace amounts of this ""poison"", and where else it might be found?  Wine, toothpaste, cough syrup, mouth wash, aspirin and many other pharmaceuticals you take orally, get injected with or put on your skin.  Now tell me the FDA, our country's premier agency for safe drugs didn't know that.  The trace amounts found in e-cigarettes is 1/10th that of aspirin and 1/40th of that found in a tobacco cigarette.  12,000 cartridges smoked in 24 hours by one person would bring you to true toxic exposure. A very heavy smoker may use 3 a day.[2]

Looking at the facts gives a true insight into the intellectual bankruptcy of who is running our country now. The government believes tobacco in any form is evil and is to be avoided and feared even though the stated harm that got it banned to begin with has been dealt with. Their actions tell you they are angry you can act as you please despite their rule making against you. They think e-cigarettes still should be banned because it normalizes smoking and gives you back some of your freedom. It's that freedom thing they can't stand, and the loss of your mandatory obedience.

Subject: Docket # DOT-OST-2011-0044 – Office of the Secretary (OST) and Department of Transportation (DOT) - Proposed Rule: Ban Smoking of Electronic Cigarettes on Aircrafts

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am submitting a comment in favor of banning the use of electronic cigarettes on aircrafts.  I have an interest in this proposed regulation since I fly for work alot and I wouldn’t want to sit next to someone smoking an electronic cigarette on an airplane.  The seating on airplanes are very close together that you wouldn’t want to be able to smell the vapor from someone smoking an electronic cigarette even though it may be barely noticeable.  They say with electronic cigarettes that second hand smoke is not an issue but there has not been enough research found stating that it does not cause absolutely any health issues for someone sitting next to someone smoking an electronic cigarette.  If there is even a chance that it could affect the health and safety of others then it would be a valid reason to pass this proposed rule.  The discomfort of having to smell an unusual odor even if it was a flavored odor from someone sitting right next to you during a 2 -6 hour flight would not be enjoyable. Smoking of cigarettes, cigars and pipes are already banned from being smoked on aircrafts, trains, etc.  So I agree why would the use of electronic cigarettes be allowed?   The popularity of the electronic cigarettes has been increasingly growing and the airlines are concerned about any safety, health and discomfort that may be imposed by their passengers, crew members or anyone else that may be on the aircraft.  There is not enough valid research that there are no health risks involved with the electronic cigarettes and there would be discomfort involved with the vapors from the product therefore I believe smoking of electronic cigarettes should be banned from aircrafts both domestic and international.  
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed ru",,,,,,,

E-cigarettes do not affect anyone but the one using them. There is no smoke, it is just vapor -- vapor that is less harmful than Vicks VapoRub.

If anything, I would've expected there to be an encouragement in the presence of E-cigarettes in aircraft and airports. On long flights going without a cigarette can be maddening to the smoker and nearby passengers as the person becomes more irate.

There is absolutely no evidence that e-cigarettes pose any danger to bystanders.  A careful reading of the FDA report (as opposed to the FDA’s press release) shows that no dangerous levels of any chemicals were found in the e-cigarette vapor.  The DOT should not be prohibiting the use of lawful products on airplanes without scientific proof of harm.  

I have used an e-cigarette instead of smoking for nearly 3 years now.  During that time, I have used my e-cigarette on planes on many occasions with absolutely no problems.  I do not hide the fact that I am using an e-cigarette, but by simply holding the vapor in my mouth for a few extra seconds, there is absolutely no visible vapor upon exhale.

If the DOT won’t ban peanuts on airplanes when there is a demonstrable and proven risk to people with severe peanut allergies, why in the world would the DOT try to ban e-cigarettes when there is absolutely no proven risk to anyone?  

The proposed regulation represents an abuse of discretion and and unwarranted over-reaching of authority on the part of the DOT.  And, as a taxpayer, I object to the abuse of authority as well as to the additional money that the DOT has expended in this particular endeavor.

I feel the DOT has gone too far in banning and the fires for using e-cigarettes. The DOT has not subjected smoking to such huge fines or penalties.

E-cigarettes do not fit the definition of smoking. Smoking includes combustion, lighting and other obvious issues, BEING THEY PRODUCE SMOKE. E--cigarettes are battery operated and produces no smoke, yes that is what I said NO SMOKE.

It appears from reports that the DOT allows the airlines to recycle air passing threw their engines. This is a serious health hazard and explains why, last time I flew in an airplane I almost gagged all the way there and back.

There is very little vaper, that can be detected and most people find it pleasant to smell, if they can detect it. How the DOT can lump vaping into smoking is beyond me.

I sincerely  hope that you will not listen to those that have a conflict of interest in bashing the e-cigarette. Please read the latest research on e-cigarettes and read the FDA report not the press release on e-cigarette.

I am a private citizen, and these comments are my personal opinions. I have no direct interest in the rulemaking process.

E-cigarettes are not, by definition, tobacco products. As a result, the FAA does not have statuatory legitimacy to regulate their use on airplanes. From the proposed rule: ""14 CFR part 252, titled Smoking Aboard Aircraft, to implement section 41706. See 65 FR 36772. As a result, part 252 today bans the smoking of tobacco products on all scheduled passenger flights of air carriers."" 

The law, itself, says: ""Smoking prohibition in intrastate and interstate air transportation.--An individual may not smoke in an aircraft in scheduled passenger interstate air transportation or scheduled passenger intrastate air transportation.""
To claim that e-cigarettes are ""smoked"" is to fundamentally misunderstand the definition of smoking. To smoke, smoke itself must be produced. E-cigarettes, which are vaporizers, cannot be smoked because they do not produce smoke. 

As the FAA says, there have been few instances of e-cigarettes being smoked aboard aircraft. Individual airlines, along with their flight crews, are perfectly capable of deciding their own rules on the usage of e-cigarettes. At this time, it does not appear as if an FAA rule is necessary--and this particular rule is not within the limits of the FAA's statuatory authority. Because the health risks of e-cigarettes are minimal, compared to cigarettes, this rule is unlikely to make a material impact in fighting cancers related to second-hand smoke. In the event that e-cigarettes gain popularity aboard aircraft, it may be necessary for the FAA to seek legal authority to regulate them. Until then, this rule must be withdrawn; the FAA should clarify that e-cigarettes ARE NOT tobacco products and that there is no legal ban on their usage aboard aircraft.

•	I respectfully request that the Department of Transportation withdraw the proposed amendment to 14CFR Part 252 that would prohibit use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) on aircraft. 
•	The law ''Prohibitions against Smoking on Scheduled Flights'' 49 U.S.C. 41706 does not authorize DOT to ban use of electronic cigarettes. 
o	The law states, ""An individual may not smoke in an aircraft."" 
o	E-cigarettes produce vapor, not smoke.

•	A fine of up to $3,300 for using an e-cigarette is excessive and unwarranted because:
o	Vapor is not smoke 
o	The 8th Amendment to the U.S. Government prohibits the government from imposing excessive bail, excessive fines, or cruel or unusual punishments. 
•	I also see that this regulation is totally unenforceable without leading to confiscation of e-cigarettes which are perfectly legal to own in the United States as determined in the court case against the FDA.
•	Also in the regulation is the exemption of approved FDA vaporizers which may or may not emit a drug into the air, this seems to be a hypocrisy by the DOT and an agenda to be an arm of the FDA to be able to confiscate e-cigarettes.
I emphatically urge the DOT withdraw the proposed amendment to 14CFR Part 252 that would prohibit use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) on aircraft.

E-cigarettes do not produce smoke and therefore do not create the byproducts of combustion. Banning e-cigarette use on planes is akin to banning the use of Nicotrol inhaler. The e-cigarette has not been shown to cause any harm to bystanders and until there is a reason to ban their use on planes, the ban is unfounded. It is the responsibility of airlines to explain the product to people who are uncomfortable with their use to alleviate concerns of those who are not educated and don't know what it is. We are happy to provide informational pamphlets for seat pockets to explain what they are and prevent panic due to use of an unknown product... but to ban use to alleviate fear is unconstitutional.

My husband and I have used e-cigarettes to avoid smoking since July 2009. Our health has improved and we have suffered no ill-effects. The vapor is virtually odorless, what slight scent there may be is unoffensive to non-smokers and the vapor does not linger in the air like smoke. They cannot be mistaken for cigarette smoking in any way and would cause no discomfort for others.

The law ''Prohibitions Against Smoking on Scheduled Flights'' 49 U.S.C. 41706 does not authorize DOT to ban use of electronic cigarettes. The law states, ""An individual may not smoke in an aircraft."" E-cigarettes produce vapor, not smoke, therefore Section 41706 does not apply to using e-cigarettes.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's tests did not find any harmful chemicals in the vapor: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/ScienceResearch/UCM173250.pdf 

Dr. Murray Laugesen of Health New Zealand conducted studies in 2008 and declared the vapor ""harmless, inhaled or exhaled.""

Drs. Zachary Cohn and Michael Siegel reviewed 16 toxicology studies of e-cigarette liquid and vapor and concluded, ""a preponderance of the available evidence shows them to be much safer than tobacco cigarettes and comparable in toxicity to conventional nicotine replacement products: http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/centers-institutes/population-development/files/article.jphp.pdf 

DOT has failed to produce any evidence that users of e-cigarettes or bystanders have been harmed; therefore 49 U.S.C. 41702 does not apply to the use of e-cigarettes. A fine of up to $3,300 for using an e-cigarette is excessive and unwarranted because vapor is not smoke.

The 8th Amendment to the U.S. Government prohibits the government from imposing excessive bail, excessive fines, or cruel or unusual punishments.

This is more about what a e-cig represents than the actual device itself.  I am against this ban.  I think it is absurd.  

What is the reasoning behind such a ban?  A Cigarette lighter or match is more dangerous then any e-cig. 

I believe people don't have a true understanding of what an electronic cigarette is.  

Before banning them, I think you may want to do some reading and look at some testing done on what they emit.

The original ban on smoking was because of health concerns, since there is no proof that the vapor produced is harmful, I see absolutely no reason for banning these devices
Commercial fog machines used in concerts and clubs use food grade glycol, the general public and health organizations show no fear or concern for such devices 
Electronic cigarettes use lab grade usp glycol, the same substance found in inhalers and nebulizers used to treat pulmonary disease such as asthma and bronchitis 
As an electronic cigarette user I am sickened by the fear mongering, these devices could help save millions of lives, they should be embraced not shunned, all evidence that I have seen points to the fact that the vapor produced by these devices is not harmful in any way, glycol is used in skin lotions and cosmetics, it’s used as a base in injectible pharmaceuticals, it’s used in food goods, and it’s used in medical inhalers and commercial fog machines

Our language, laws, and regulations are muddied enough with misconceptions.  Vaping is not smoking.  Nothing combusts.  There is no smoke produced.  Fog is not smoke.  Liquid vapor is not smoke.  Please do not further muddy the water by categorizing use of e-cigarettes as smoking.

In my opinion the DOT has not proven its case regarding a potential ban on electronic cigarettes. The concern with such a personal matter should be focused on whether or not it is causing harm to others. If not the use of this device is a matter of personal preference.

Using an Electronic Cigarette is not smoking. It is an extremely effective device that is helping millions of people to quit smoking. The vapor that is being produced by an electronic cigarette is being drawn directly into the human body. The only potential harm to others is limited to the exhaled breath of the user after the vapor has been filtered through the human body. It seems to me that before any sort of ban is contemplated, proof is needed that harm is in fact being done to non-users. Conduct a test to analyze the exhaled breath of people that smoke, or use nicotine gum, or e-cigarettes, or patches or nicotine inhalers. When you compare the results I suspect you will find that the electronic cigarette falls in line with your approved products like nicotine gum and if so a ban would not be justified.

 The vapour they generate will not harm bystanders, so there is virtually no second hand exposure risk associated with the use of these products.
Legislation is required however for their use in public places in order to avoid the problem of being confused with traditional cigarettes that are rightly banned. A simple solution is a legislation enforcing that all marketd electronic cigarette should display a green or blue light instead of a red one that may generate confusion.
As far as their use in the airplane is concerned, their use could be restricted to long haul flights (more than 4 hrs duration for example) only.
These are simple and pragmatic suggestions and should be considered. I am against a generalized ban of these  products.

Even though only vapors are emitted in the air and not smoke, there have not been efficient studies on the health impact of third parties.  Also, the propylene glycol that is an ingredient in the electronic cigarette’s vapors can cause respiratory effects on people. Not all ingredients have been disclosed; therefore it is not possible to know what other reactions third parties may have to the vapors. Other uses of public transportation, such as Amtrak, do not allow the use of electronic cigarettes on their trains. With the air quality being an issue in aircraft, adding something to it that could be an issue to passengers is something best avoided.  
Another avenue that needs to be addressed is the use of battery operated machinery in flight. Would there be any interference with controls of the communication and navigation system? 
Thank you for allowing me to voice my concerns about this issue.  I appreciate our attention to this matter.
Sincerely, 
Stephanie Kozel

I am not necessarily attached to the ban, I am an asthmatic and am attached to clean air which would not hinder my breathing.

In reading the proposed ban of novelty e-cigarettes I am wondering if the rule could cast a broader net. For example, instead of pointing out the electronic nature of the cigarette and the specific anatomy of the ""e-cigarette"" that the nature of  the device being ""an alternative to cigarettes that allow the user to experience nicotine through the use of mutual air"". In that the right of those who are experiencing this mutual air are allowed to be safe.

For example, the Tobacco Control Act states: ""any product made or derived from tobacco"".

Perhaps the act could be amended to state ""any product that delivers tobacco through the use of mutual air supply (which is to be considered 50 feet of another citizen.""


My reasoning is that although the ban of these cigarettes is a huge amount of work, and undoubtedly this multimillion dollar industry will find another way to provide tobacco to it's users despite the bans put in place.",,,,,,,

The smoking of electronic cigarettes creates a discomfort for many non-smoking passengers, and it is unfair to jeopardize the comfort of an equal paying customer. The purpose of the smoking ban in part 252 is, “…to improve air quality within the aircraft, reduce the risk of adverse health effects on passengers and crewmembers, and enhance aviation safety and passenger comfort” (Docket, 2011).

You mention the use of PG, and while it is true, there are many products that use PG, there are also ones which use Vegetable Glycol, (VG), and some that use a blend of the two.

The exhaled water vapor is no more harmful than the body odor, and purfumes many passengers are often subjected to when the planes environmental systems are sealed...  

A heavy smoker can actually burp smoke from his lungs, several hours after he has smoked...  The smoke detectors could detect smoke, but cool water vapor???

It just seems difficult to enforce.  Also, there are perscription inhailers, which look very similar to some of the PV's being used.  ",,,,,,,

Dr. Murray Laugesen of Health New Zealand conducted studies in 2008 and declared the vapor ""harmless, inhaled or exhaled.""

Drs. Zachary Cohn and Michael Siegel reviewed 16 toxicology studies of e-cigarette liquid and vapor and concluded, ""a preponderance of the available evidence shows them to be much safer than tobacco cigarettes and comparable in toxicity to conventional nicotine replacement products.

E-cigarettes do not harm bystanders

Since those who inhale the vapor directly are reporting their health has improved, it defies belief that the residual vapor they exhale could possibly harm bystanders.

Commercial artificial smoke generators used in aviation emergency training produce cannot be compared to exhaled e-cigarette vapor. 

They produce a continuous, thick, dense smoke, but e-cigarette vapor is thin and dissipates quickly.

Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel; Accessibility of Aircraft and Stowage of Wheelchairs

My name is Gary Talbot and I have been a fulltime wheelchair user for over 30 years and have logged over 1 million miles of airline travel in the past 30 years.  I currently sit on the U.S. Access Board although my comments are my personal opinions and not the opinions of the Access Boards.  A well signed, designated space in the main cabin is all we need to ensure people with disabilities are able to fly and travel independently without fear of our chairs left behind, damage to the unit or other passengers hating us because they just got bumped off the flight due to seat strapping of our device.  The issue of main cabin stowage of folded wheelchairs is critical for people with disabilities and the seat strapping solution is one of the most degrading experiences I have had in any of my flights and experiences that span over a million flight miles.  My thoughts are listed in bold below to the questions asked in the NPRM:

a.	This is absolutely correct.  Seat strapping folded wheelchairs takes time and can be very difficult for the employees.  Flight attendants may see 100 different type folding chairs (or more) and each one could require slightly different strapping techniques.  These complexities alone will require additional time to strap the folded chair and could delay flights and bring additional negative attention on the wheeled mobility user.  When the aircraft has a designated storage area/closet the folded wheelchair is simply placed inside the space or closet requiring no special skill or training by the airline employees.  The sequence to simply fold and stow the folded wheelchair in the designated space is extremely ",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2011-0098-0004/attachment_1.pdf",

I am concerned that US DOT seeks to further weaken aircraft access by removing the obligation to stow folding wheelchairs in the cabin closet. For many of us who use either power assist or manual chairs, a well signed, designated space in the main cabin is all we need to ensure people with disabilities are able to fly independently; without fear of our chairs left behind, damage to the unit or adding further frustration to other passengers because they just got bumped off a flight due so their seats can be used for seat strapping of our chairs. It also adds a potential for damage to the chair, complexity for and potential injury to cabin crew.  It simply makes little sense.  Further, it amplifies the spectacle and stigmatization that I and so many others must endure to board an aircraft with the help of untrained and ignorant ground staff who transfer us to straight backs, (which are often left exposed to the elements at medium and smaller airports including DCA) then strap us down as if we need to be restrained.
US DOT should be strengthening the Air Carriers Access Act by ensuring every aircraft including commuter jets serving small airports such as Wichita KS, Tuscaloosa AL, Burlington VT and the DC/BAL/PHY/NYC/BOS corridor provide a designated space onboard that holds a folded manual wheelchair and does not require seat strapping.  The space could be a closet or located at the tail directly behind the rear seats.  On two aisle aircraft, it would be reasonable to assume capacity to stow two or more chairs on board and possibly more depending on the fare classes provided by the aircraft.  USDOT should also ensure signage at aircraft entries and at the stowage location identifies the right of passengers to stow their manual chairs onboard.  Finally, the department must prohibit U.S. and foreign carriers from removing existing closets or priority spaces used for stowing chairs.",,,,,,,

Similar to improving passenger rights, US DOT should strengthen the Air Carriers Access Act, not weaken it. ACAA should cover every 40+ seat aircraft including commuter jets serving small airports to provide a designated space onboard that holds a folded manual wheelchair and does not require seat strapping.  The space should be a closet and signage should be provided that identifies passengers rights to stow their manual chairs and walkers onboard.

3.   In terms of impact both economic and and impact to regional/local infrastructure, it would be beneficial if DOT would document in the NOFA that ""impacts"" are relevent especially when it comes to Tribal projects.  So, for example, if a project addresses traditional fishing practices through development of boatramp/park/smoking facilities, acknowledge that this impact be measured in terms of the benefit to the Tribe in terms of not only dollars, but the cultural impact to the Tribe by continuing to conduct fishing activities.

Overall the grant opportunity is very much appreciated and I would like to talk to you about these issues.  I don't think any of them would change the meaning of the NOFA but would be more specfiic in terms of ranking Tribal project applications.  Thank you.

It has provided significant benefits to the nation; however, one change would allow its benefits to penetrate throughout more of America by modifying the ""rural"" and ""urban"" definitions.  Small urban communities find it difficult to compete due to the minimum $10 million dollar threshold and many good projects that could bring regional and metropolitan benefits to their area are left without an avenue for funding.  The suggestion is to divide the ""urban"" category into ""small urban and urban"" instead allowing ""small urban"" communities between 50,000 and 100,000, based on the 2010 census, to have projects for a minimum of $5 million dollars and ""urban"" areas (over 100,000 popluation) to compete at the $10 million dollar level.  In reviewing the awards made to these ""small urban"" areas under the TIGER I and TIGER II programs, this level of minimum funding more closely matches the awards provided to these smaller communities.",,,,,,,

Can you consider implementing or verify the following suggested stipulations.

1. Confirm the max awarded dollar limit for one single project in a Rural area per a Capital Improvement Project is up to 25% of $140 million for a State with no other awarded rural projects were approved.

2. The submittal of a previously completed NEPA Environmental Review(s) can not be disqualified due to the age of the report or its relation to a specific previous project but that the report providing the information required matches the same requirements for a new project being submitted.

3. The portion of the project that the match funding will pay for can be completed after Sept. 2013 when used to complete the last portion of construction if the project extends past the Sept 2013 date.

Thanks for your consideration. I can be reached at wpcedc@mwpower.net for more clarification.

The importance of TIFIA for large mega-projects cannot be overemphasized, especially as it relates to the overall financial viability of these projects. This is further underscored by the current level of over subscription of the program which not only represents an overwhelming demand for TIFIA in the financial plan of these projects, but the importance it has to the successful of these projects. With this being said, we encourage and implore USDOT to make full use and maximize the issuance of TIGER TIFIA payments for credit assistance in the current 2011TIGER Discretionary Grant program for qualifying and deserving projects that need this most beneficial tool to provide maximum leveraging of funds.
2.	We applaud USDOT in assuring that TIGER Grants awarded to date have been exceedingly geographically diverse in distribution. Consistent with Congressional intent, we encourage USDOT to continue these efforts by choosing projects that provide the greatest geographical distribution possible within the constraints of the available 2011 TIGER Discretionary Grant program funds.

Comments:

The Notice indicates the Grants are for capital investment in surface transportation infrastructure, and eligible projects include highway or bridge projects, among others.  Would Intelligent Transportation System projects or project components be considered eligible and appropriate for this program?

Is there a preference for submittal of projects with multiple partnering agencies vs. submittal of a project from a sigle agency?

Will multimodal projects have an advantage over single mode projects?

Thank you.",,,,,,,

The public input   period must be extended to the DISABILITY COMMUNITY organizations & Advocates as provision  of  fair & equal time of input on this matter.
Currently the submission link on the government regulations website is not directly accessible to those who use screen reading devices, precluding   input from the disability community. 
The  ""Accommodation  of Time ,is  requested  to allow Equal  Access and equal Opportunity of  public input on behalf of the   entire  disability  community . 
Time limits on filling out   submission forms need   be lifted permanently, as accommodation on behalf of those with disabilities.
  Currently there is a time limit to complete the submission form of 20 minutes, there should be none.
To level the “playing field” any   accommodation cannot be cumbersome as to present a hardship or be any different from that afforded to the public and to ensure equal opportunity for input by those with disabilities.

The Govt.  Regulation   web site ,ACAA submission form & docket DOT-OST-2011-0177 must be accessible and  meet universal Accessibility  standard of  the WC3.

The WC3   UNIVERSAL  standard  of Accessibility is   imperative as   provision of   accommodation  to allow for   Equal Opportunity and Equal  Input by the Disability Community The prerequisite of Accessibility and Accommodation  must be  adhered to in order to  achieve   a lawful outcome on any  Federal Ruling : section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Accessibility is a  Civil Right  to which all Federal Agencies must adhere .

Dear Ms. Reither:

The following comments on the Department of Transportation’s proposed amendments to the Code of Federal Regulations concerning enforcement of the Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 (ACAA), 49 U.S.C. § 41705, are submitted by Disability Rights New Jersey (DRNJ), the designated protection and advocacy system for individuals with disabilities in New Jersey, pursuant to the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. §§ 5041 to 15045; the Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 10801 to 10807; the Client Assistance Program of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 732; the Protection and Advocacy for Individual Rights Program of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794e; and the Technology Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities, 29 U.S.C. § 3004.

DRNJ welcomes the Department’s decision to include accessibility to airline and travel agency websites and self-service kiosks as a component to ACAA enforcement. However, DRNJ has significant concerns regarding how the Department intends to enforce these standards. Without a robust system of enforcement, even the most carefully thought-out standards may not result in accessibility for air travelers with disabilities.

DRNJ suggests that the Department require all carriers to report on the actual costs associated with compliance with these new regulations.  The Department is properly concerned that the actual costs incurred by carriers may substantially exceed the estimated costs in the 2004 NPRM.  It is likely, as the Department suggests, that the use of more sophisticated web authoring tools and services will result in lower costs for ca",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2011-0177-0022/attachment_1.doc,https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2011-0177-0022/attachment_1.pdf",

What I anticipated this to be like and the reality of what came to be was completely different.  Although service animal relief areas are required, they are all outside of the airports, so, spite this consideration to provide something for us to access with our dogs to relieve them, there are barriers.  Currently, in order for me to relieve my service animal, I have to go outside of the secure area of the terminal, find the potty area, relieve my dog and then go back through the entire screening process again. 

This IS an unreasonable process to go through especially when rules are designed to help individuals with disabilities.  Since many airports are large and packed, flights can be missed easily!  Airports can be intimidating and stressful to start.  The first time I flew since having the service animal relief areas implemented I was very disappointed, after asking about 13 airport personnel where the designated area was, I was mislead by many who simply did not know, to finally realize it was outside passed security.  I no longer had time to relieve my dog, nor did I have a moment to sit and catch my breath, where if proper set up was placed, I would have been able to relieve my service dog, not have become stressed and would have been able to sit as the rest of the travelers get to experience.  My challenges are invisible, but I cannot imagine how person with mobility or vision challenges would have navigated their way through successfully since I could not spite my efforts. 

It is only reasonable to place relief areas within the terminals inside the security area somehow.  The space needs to me minimal, perhaps taking guidance and care as they are able to provide areas on cruises to accommodate.  When delayed overnight, I certainly was disgusted with the relief area in place in Detroit. Dirty, dark, isolated, unsafe and inconvenient...not cool!",,,,,,,

As a person with a disability, my travel is severely hamper at present due to the restrictions placed on having to exit many airports to simply relieve my service dogs.  

Many times I am forced to exit the secured area and actually leave the airport to simply allow my dog a much needed break.  This is not only troublesome, but is not within the spirit and intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

We have come so far as a minority group, please level the playing field a little more so we can relax between our flights like other travelers who are not disabled.

It is essentially a ninety-day period where airports and plane companies can look into their proposed orders and make the necessary adjustments. This will be enough time for airports to find a new kiosk provider if needed and to adjust for the difference in cost. The ninety-day period is also a sufficient amount of time for carriers to enter into agreements with airports to implement shared-use accessible kiosks.

The reason for which such a large-scale implementation can be effectively executed is because the necessary foundational technology is already in existence. Typically, in system wide overhauls, a majority of the time is spent in the research and development phase, however this would not have to be the case. As specified within the proposal, the process will be guided by section 707 of the DOJ’s 2010 ADA standards that documents the applicable standards for which accessible ATM’s are to adhere too. Because a federally approved method of performing a similar function already exists, it would only make sense that the technology used to make the ATM’s accessible could be easily adapted to perform the functions of an airport kiosk.

Another useful technology already being used is an ipad that is made accessible to blind people by combining touch and sound. Similar versions of this touch screen can easily be retrofitted to replace the screens currently used in automatic kiosks. Also, the proposal mentions the existence of kiosks that already have the hardware necessary to aid in accessibility. All that would need to be installed is the right software. Again, similar software to that which is being used in the ATM’s should be easy to apply to these kiosks.

This is not to say the entire system could or should be completely transformed within this time-frame, however it affirms the potential that airlines will be able",,,,,,,

Dear Mr. Podberesky:

I have been visually impaired my entire life and will be completely blind in the near future. 
I enjoy traveling and have been to 25 states and 3 countries. Unfortunately every time I try to fly my experience gets increasingly more difficult due to my vision worsening - from finding the best priced tickets online to waiting in long lines to purchse my ickets just because I cannot read kiosks.

Regarding Web sites, although I am happy with the technical standards DOT plans to apply to airline Web sites, there is no performance standard to ensure that the Web site will actually be usable by blind people.  Many Web sites conform to accessibility guidelines but are still only partially accessible or difficult to use with my screen access software.  Because I want to be able to use the Web site with substantially equivalent ease of use as sighted people, I ask DOT to include a performance standard in addition to the technical standards. 

Regarding kiosks, DOT is requiring all newly purchased kiosks to meet the proposed accessibility guidelines.  What if some airlines take several years to purchase new kiosks?  I do not want to wait several years before I am finally able to use a kiosk to check in or print my boarding pass, especially considering that this discrimination has gone on for far too long already.  I ask DOT to require airlines to retrofit a portion of their current kiosks for accessibility to ensure that blind people do not have to wait several years and so that airlines will not try to avoid following the new rule by delaying the purchase of new kiosks.  

In conclusion all Web sites and kiosks must be fully accessible to the blind.

Sincerely,

Graham Mehl

Please find a way to reinstate escorted access to non-designated outdoor areas within sterile zones. This was the practice before the security changes. Using escorted access will eliminate the need to construct relief areas and will provide timely access to many relief areas.

Relieving on the pavement next to the plane was never a problem for my guide dogs. I carry my own pick-up bags and would not expect these to be provided for me.

No matter what approach is taken, I strongly urge access to outdoor relief areas within the sterile zone. Within recent years, I have been in airports that have specially constructed relief areas for service animals within the sterile zone, but I do not use these facilities for my service animal because the relief areas are indoors.

RE:	docket number DOT-OST-2011-0182


To Whom It May Concern:

As a guide dog handler and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Guide Dog Users, Inc., I would like to voice my support for  the Department of Transportation's proposal ""to amend (49 CFR) part 27 by inserting a provision that would require airport operators to work with carriers to establish relief areas for service animals that accompany passengers with disabilities departing, connecting, or arriving at U.S. airports.""  Adoption of such rules will constitute a crucial reasonable accommodation for air-travelers with disabilities who travel with the assistance of a trained service dog. I further support these relief areas being located inside the sterile area of each terminal.

Currently, blind travelers who are guided by a trained service dog experience extreme hardship due to a widespread lack of relief areas for service dogs within the sterile area of airport terminals. It is not practical for a blind handler of a guide dog to leave the sterile area to seek a designated relief area in response to his or her guide dog's relief needs, and then undergo re-screening, and ultimately succeed in making a connecting flight. In fact, the time and distance required of connecting passengers means that relieving the service dog is only possible at the very beginning and the very end of an itinerary, which often requires that the service dog must be denied relief for an unreasonable amount of time, causing true hardship for the working dog and unnecessary stress for the blind handler. 

In order for disabled travelers, who are assisted by service dogs, to have reasonable access to air travel, as non-disabled travelers do, the needs of their service dogs must be reasonably accommodated.

Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance (U.S. Airports)
AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, Department of Transportation (DOT).

ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).
49 CFR Part 27

I am a blind American who travels independently guided by a trained service dog (a guide dog). I appreciate and support the Department of Transportation’s proposal “to amend (49 CFR) part 27 by inserting a provision that would require airport operators to work with carriers to establish relief areas for service animals that accompany passengers with disabilities departing, connecting, or arriving at U.S. airports.” 

There is currently a serious need for such a reasonable accommodation for those of us whose disabilities are somewhat mitigated by the assistance of a trained service dog. Currently, we experience extreme hardship, due to the lack of practical provisions for the relief of our service dogs at U.S. airports. 

The realities of air-travel have changed significantly over the past decade. Travelers are offered limited options, in terms of both direct and connecting flights, and all travelers must now participate in security screening procedures. The time needed for air travel (from the time required for entering the departure airport to the time when a traveler exits the airport at the arrival destination) has increased significantly, and there are limited options available for making flight connections. 

It is not reasonable to require that a blind handler of a guide dog leave the sterile area to seek a designated relief area in response to his or her guide dog’s relief needs, and then undergo re-screening; all to be accomplished between connecting flights. 

Because of the current widespread lack of practical service animal relief areas at airports, the time and distance required of connecting passengers means that it is only possible ",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2011-0182-0018/attachment_1.pdf",

I support the Department of Transportation’s proposal “to amend (49 CFR) part 27 by inserting a provision that would require airport operators to work with carriers to establish relief areas for service animals that accompany passengers with disabilities departing, connecting, or arriving at U.S. airports.” 
Such relief areas are most needed within the sterile area of an airport terminal. 

The Transportation Security Administration has said that a relief area can safely be constructed inside of the sterile area, and that it is also appropriate for badged personnel to provide escort to a disabled traveler to access restricted areas where a disabled person’s service dog might be offered relief within the sterile area. This clarification acknowledges the legitimate need for reasonable accommodation of disabled travelers who are assisted by a service dog. 
Please require these reasonable accommodations for service animal relief within the sterile area of airports. 

It is not reasonable to require that a disabled handler of a service dog leave the sterile area to seek a designated relief area in response to his or her service dog’s relief needs, and then undergo re-screening; all to be accomplished between connecting flights. 

Because of the current widespread lack of practical service animal relief areas at airports, the time and distance required of connecting passengers means that it is only possible for a disabled person to reliev his or her service dog at the very beginning and the very end of a trip. Practically speaking, this means that that service dog must be denied any opportunity to relieve for an extreme amount of time, causing genuine hardship and stress for both service dog and disabled handler.

Dot-0st-20011

Please accomadate realief areas inside the airport.

Reason: Inside once you get through security  check there is a risk of missing connecting flights when you have to go out side and back in through security.

I attended a FEMA Conference last month in Washington DC 
my flight was delayed coming back home to Hawaii. Which made me miss my connecting flight which ended up  causeing me to take 5 different flights to get home, from DC to Minnasota to Alabama, to San Francisco to LA the next day then home to Hawaii. each stop I had to get assistence to go outside then back through security and escorted to my Gate. I am Blind it was really a nightmare experence and 
stressful for my Guide dog.

So you see the unexpected can occure there is a serious need for releif areas inside of the check points and the staff needs to be awear wear the releaif areas are located.

Earle Baum Center of the Blind 
Docket Number: DOT-OST-2011-0182

My name is Allan Brenner. I am a guide dog handler and have been such for about 15 years. I am the CEO of Earle Baum Center of the Blind, Immediate past Chair of VisionServe Alliance and Past President of California State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind, a Governor appointed position.

I frequently travel by air throughout the United States and infrequently, outside. One of the biggest obstacles for safe and comfortable travel with my guide dog is the lack of access to relieving areas when in the airport. Currently, with few exceptions, one must exit the airport security areas in order to find a relieving area which is often both difficult to find and unsafe. At times, the only option is the busy street.

Since most flights require stopover or change of planes, unless one has enough time to exit the airport and return through security, the guide dog suffers. Arriving at the airport at least one hour in advance of the flight, taking into consideration the flight time, stopovers, additional flights, delays and time to exit the final destination, many hours can pass without having the opportunity to relieve my guide dog. It feels cruel and stressful to both of us as a team. 

I have been asking for service dog relieve areas within the sterile zone of airports for years to no avail. As most people recognize, air travel is challenging for everyone but the additional challenges traveling with a guide dog significantly make air travel undesirable. 

I would like to see relief areas located in each terminal no further than a 5 to 7 minute walk from any gate so that one can relieve a guide dog with a 30 minute stopover. The surface can range from grass, dirt or gravel. The key is the ease of access and availability to help make air travel with a service dog team more in line with the experience of the general public.

Upkeep of the area is also a concern. 

As airports expand and pave over more ""green"" areas, such relieving areas are becoming harder to find, if they exist at all. In an unfamiliar airport this can be very difficult and even scary if there are delays. 

I am also wondering what happens if a plane is stuck on the tarmac and my dog can't get out to relieve.  What happens then?

Relief areas are required within a 15 minute window of boarding or exit from the aircraft.  This may fall within secured areas at larger airports. ( I have actually been told at Denver to use the family bathroom to relieve my guide which is totally unacceptable.)

The area should be outside,  a minimum of 10x15 feet and   have a lidded trash can and supply of doggy cleanup bags.   Fencing is not necessarily required as guide dogs are under control of their users at all times and remain on leash.  (Pets on the other hand are another story).  The area should be cleaned daily and clearly labled as a relieivng area.  Signage is critical as well as notations on AP maps and websites.  Training should be provided to all AP and carrier  staff so that they are familiar with the areas locations and can direct users to the location.  I  don't feel it is necessary to provide escorts to the area unless security is an issue.

I have found smaller regional airports to be a non issue as one can typically get out of the airport within a resonable time frame and back due to short distances.  Releiving areas are not really necessary.

Compliance should be within 90 days.

Would this legislation apply to cruise terminals?",,,,,,,

However, it is not easy as a blind person to go out, find the area, and get back in through security.  Usually there is not enough time between planes to even do this.  If a service dog relief area could be provided inside the sterile or secure area, service animal handlers could attend to the dog's needs and still have time to make their connection.  This could be done with an area similar to a human restroom, using floors covered in an absorable media such as wood shavings, a floor drain, and available pickup bags.

Any less generous provision unacceptably increases the risk of the peron with disabilities being unable to return in time to board his/her flight.

These comments are based on experienced with my sister, who frequently travels by air to and from Chicago, the nearest airport to my home.

It is hard for others to understand at times. But should you find yourself in need of a working canine, you would want to ensure the canine could be with you whenever possible.  The canines are well trained to be in public settings without drawing attention or doing any inappropriate action.  They do, however, need to ""toilet"" if in an airport or traveling for an extended period of time.  Toileting is limited to the front of airport areas, past security.  This can prove difficult for travelers with working canines.  We have noticed there are often designated outside areas to smoke after the security check point.  It would be most helpful to have a designated spot or portion of the smoking area for working canines to toilet.  It would need to be outside, as working canines are trained to never toilet indoors. Those with working canines are aware of clean up procedures and would work to ensure the area remained clean.  This might prove difficult at some airports and it may need to be more on a case by case basis.  We do not wish to ask for more than what would appear ""logical"" to help those in need. But if one has ever traveled with a working dog, they understand the dynamics of how hard it is and the complexity of going through security, ensuring the dog is taken care of and not put too much demand on any one person, airport or working dog.  Consideration in helping those in need would be invaluable.  Especially today...with everyone is saying go..go..go and those with working canines can only ""go"" so fast and do so much to adapt to the world of those who do not or are not in need of an assistant dog.

Marty is my brother-in-law. Juanita is my brother-in-law's eyes.  Service dogs are as essential to the people needing them as your own body parts is essential to you.  I am appalled that Airport security has put an unfair burden on those traveling with service dogs for something as essential as a usable bathroom area for a person's service animal. 


I am requesting that the following be incorporated into the new DOT rule change:

1. Require at least one relieving area INSIDE the ""sterile"" TSA security area of each terminal.

2. A minimum of 20 square feet per relieving area

3. The relieving area should be OPEN-AIR (outside of the terminal building) since service dogs are trained NOT to relieve indoors.

2011-0182 The current system of having service animal relief areas outside the ""sterile area"" or TSA screening checkpoint is impractical for people who have mobility or visual impairments. 
Traveling with an adult familly member with autism who uses a service dog and has a gait impairment was a very frustrating and difficult experience, as the relief areas were over a mile from the gate and required travel by train in order to access them. Signage was poor. Other service dog users have advised purchasing a newspaper and training the animal to use the paper in the airport restroom as an alternative. If the air carriers will not provide a relief area, it seems that service dog users may have to creatively provide their own. Cruise liners solve the problem by providing kiddie pools with shredded newspaper or mulch. Such an arrangement would solve many problems for disabled travelers.

Relief areas should be accessible from both outside and within sterile areas to accomodate arriving, departing and transfering passengers.  Also, these areas should be accessed quickly and with as little walking as possible. All airport staff should be able to assist a passenger to the relief area. Signage should also be made available for those persons who can see and read them.

Adoption of such rules will constitute a crucial reasonable accommodation for air-travelers with disabilities who travel with the assistance of a trained service dog. We further support these relief areas being located inside the sterile area of each terminal.

 Relief areas inside of the sterile area (inside of security) are desperately needed because connecting passengers cannot offer their guide dog relief as things are now because of a lack of opportunity to do so inside of the secured zone. 

The TSA suggested that airports offer authorized staff to escort a service dog handler outside of restricted areas to relieve their dog .  This could be a low-cost answer that could take effect immediately. 

I also wish to affirm the efforts that TSA has made in clarifying that there is no security problem with service animal relief areas inside of the secured zone.

I have flown numerous times with my assistance dog and a primary concern has always been my dog's welfare because toileting has almost always been impossible to accomplish.

On a few occasions, when flying regional carriers, I've been able to toilet my dog outdoors in an out of the way place on the tarmac. On only one occasion when I had a 3 hour layover was I able to make my way to the outdoor dog area at the Atlanta Airport so my dog could eliminate between flights. That area in my mind is nearly useless. It is so small and located adjacent to a very busy roadway which is very dangerous for dogs.

Whenever I've flown, I've tried to be proactive and find out where dog relief areas are at the airports I will be traveling through, but the simple fact is that they are always located outside of the secure areas, are generally located at a great distance from the arrival gates, and it's not possible for me to get to and from that area before my connection leaves, both because of the distances involved and the time it would take to get through security again.

Any other times I've flown in the last 12+ years, my dog has either needed to ""hold it"" or I have resorted to having him eliminate on a CHUX pad placed on the floor in the ladies' restroom, which I've then bagged and disposed of in the trash can. This really is not an acceptable solution to me, but it's the only one available at this time. There have been times when I've been stuck in a gate area for hours due to weather or maintenance issues, but could not leave because the flight could be called at any minute. This jeopardizes my dog's health.

It's vital that airports provide accessible areas for assistance dog relief within the secure areas. If there is more than one terminal, it would be best if each one had a dog relief area, or at least be centrally located so that distances could be minimized.",,,,,,,

In the interest of airport security I can definitely understand TSA's desire to allow the service dog team to exit the sterile area via an access door and would prefer they exit the secure area of the airport all together…but this does pose a problem when there is limited time between connecting flights or the handler is confined to a chair.

Here is a though!  Cruise ships routinely accommodate service dogs by providing wooden boxes filled with sand, artificial grass that drains urine, litter, etc.  For flights it would be the responsibility of the service dog team to train their dogs to use these boxes, and for the airport to provide a small ventilate room for the service dogs to do their business in.  I have seen many “SMOKING” areas within the sterile areas to accommodate an addiction…why not mandate a room for service dogs to relieve themselves in under the ADA?  

This way the sterile area can be kept intact and the service dog teams are accommodated.  Just like a human with a full bladder, a service dog with a full bladder is not at 100% which could impact the safety of the team.

As a frequent (weekly) traveler I am continually faced with the challenge of relieving my service dog between connecting flights or after entering a sterile area and then encountering a significantly delayed departure.  Presently, in both cases, I must not only leave the sterile area but typically traverse a significant distance to find an appropriate relieving area.

Visually impaired persons not only have the challenge of being re-screened to enter a sterile area, after relieving, but are significantly challenged to even find an appropriate relieving area.

Airline, airport, and TSA personnel are rarely willing to assist me in finding an appropriate relieving area or in expediting my screening after leaving a sterile area and then reentering.  It is virtually impossible to leave a sterile area, find an appropriate relieving area, and be re-screened between connecting flights.

Coast-to-coast trips, with a connection, currently require my service dog to ""hold"" their relieving for 12+ hours due to screening times, being to the gate an hour before boarding, connections, and disembarking an aircraft.

I have flown with my hearing dog several times.   When changing planes, it's extremely important that there be a relief area for my service dog, in a location that is outside, well maintained by an employee, and within a close distance of where fliers will be changing planes; it is best this area be within the secure area.  From my own experience, I have noticed I have barely time to make it a relief area and back before time for my plane to leave.  In that time, sometimes I need to also find food for myself to eat and take a restroom break. I have problems with my feet and ankles also so it needs to be a distance that isn't too far. 

My dog and other service dogs are well trained to not potty inside a building.  If they did, it could cause problems with them going in public places.  So it is very important the dog potty in an outside area, preferabble an area which has grass or wood chips as the dogs are usually trained to go in the grass or on a mulched area.  

The place needs to have been kept clean. I am aware that sometimes is hard for individuals who are blind or individuals who have other disabilities to adequately clean up after their dogs.  So the area needs to be checked a few times per day.  

Also important is that airline employees all know where the area is and can help the indivual find the area quickly as time is a factor in not missing a plane.  I also wanted to mention that employees should be trained the proper way to work with individuals accompanied by a service dog (don't send them through the xray machine, don't require the dog to be in a crate etc.)  From my own experience, I noticed many employees were unaware of the laws.

Thank you very much for your time and for letting us give input based on our experience",,,,,,,

Going through security is a lengthy and exhausting process.  There are many circumstances in which traveling outside of the sterile area to find a relief area would result in a missed flight.  When you consider the many disabilities which hinder ease of movement and thus require a service dog, you can understand why it is so important to provide easy and timely access to relief areas from every point inside the sterile area.  Not everyone requires a service dog, but for those of us who do, this is vital.  ",,,,,,,

While traveling between Newark Airport and Dallas/Fort Worth, I was unable to locate a pet relief area in either airport.  I did quite a bit of research before traveling and knew the locations of the pet relief areas but was unable to locate them once in the airport.  Much to my dismay, and my dogs, there was no relief area within the sterile area of the airport.  It is difficult enough to travel with a service dog and without a pet relief area within the sterile area it just makes traveling that much harder.  Please consider making it a prerequisite that all airports must have a pet relief area in a more accessible area, which would be inside the security area.

One area for each terminal will NOT suffice for many airports.  Some terminals have multiple concourse that require travel through a connecting area.  The minimum number of relief areas should be determined by a maximum travel time from any gate, such as 10 minutes.  For some of us who normally use power wheelchairs, but must rely on manual wheelchairs in the airport, it is often necessary to wait for airport or airline personnel.  This greatly increases the time. The Department should also provide minimum design standards.

Missing a flight is commonplace as a consequence of some of the outdated and inconvenient locations of relief areas.

The distance and time involved in moving between check-in and gates or between gates/terminals while changing flights is already a challenge for me.  My German Shepherd Service Dog, Teddy, makes it possible for me to fly independently.  She handles herself like the pro that she is, and the two of us can handle our challenges with effort and with grace.  

However, not having reasonable access to relief areas within the sterile areas of flight terminals can impose a huge burden on us  in the way of distance and time that make travel even tougher.  In some instances, it can make it impossible to make connections.  

Please, when you next walk through terminals, try to imagine how defeating it would be to have to detour to more distant areas for relief outsize the sterile zones and how further demoralizing it would be to miss connections in the process.

Teddy can't use the restrooms like you can.  And it is horrible to put her through situations in which she can barely hold her urine after doing her job for me faithfully and for long hours. 

It isn't a good deal we're asking for, just simple assistance in making our own way fairly and with dignity.

It is ridiculous to expect a handler to navigate out to the area which takes 30 minutes. Checking through the security takes a longer time because of the dog's equipment and, therefore, adds more time to the equation. Lay overs are usually only a half hour long anyhow, giving you enough time to locate the gate and use the restroom yourself. Why should the dog have to suffer? To avoid unnecessary clean ups, there should be 1 relief area within the security zone. I have had to become very creative in having my dog just relieve in the human bathroom just because I want to avoid the public's response to an embarrassing accident or there wasn't enough time to leave and come back in. The relief area outside the check point is ok for pets and things once they have been picked up, they would have to go, but there wouldn't be as much walking since they would be outside the check point. I will be traveling through the Dover airport in February but will not be able to use the relief area because my flight connects too quickly.

As a person who travels frequently with an Assistance Dog, it is terribly important that an appropriate area, within the ""sterile"" zone at airports, be available for my dog to relieve himself. Please consider the incredible extra time and effort that it takes for us to travel outside the airport, between connections, in order to accomplish this, and then to have to return and make our way through security. 

My dog is very well behaved, and he is well trained, but for his comfort and the health of all persons traveling within airports, a designated area is required for pet relief.

This is something that is going to be extremely helpful to the disabled that are traveling with their assistance dog.

This difficulty of traveling occurs both before and after a long flight when traveling with my assistance dog and also when attempting to get to a connecting flight which is almost impossible to do.

It is imperative that appropriate dog relief areas be placed inside the ""sterile area"" within each airline terminal to allow disabled travelers the access we need.  These installations are long overdue.

I am a full time wheelchair user who also uses the services of a mobility assistance dog to help mitigate my disability.

When traveling by air, it is always difficult to make my connecting flights as I have to wait until the entire plane has disembarked before they get someone to bring me an aislechair and escort me off the plane to my wheelchair which hopefully someone has brought up from the cargo hold.  My service dog has been trained to hold his eliminations when we are traveling but sometimes a trip across the country takes us 12 hours or longer and my service dog needs to eliminate before we reach our destination and get to a place where he can do his buisiness.  Having a relief area that is located within the sterile area of an airport is of great importance to those of us who travel with a service dog.

If our service dogs need to use the relief area and it is not located within the sterile area, it can add almost 90 minutes to the amount of time it would take to get to and use the relief area and go back through the security area to get to our connecting flight.  Most of the time we do not have an extra 90 minutes to spend going outside of the airport, let our dogs relieve themselves, go back through the security line and get to the gate to board our flight.  It is super important that all airports have at least one SD relife area located within that sterile area so that we have the time to let our dogs potty and still get to our connecting flight, especially when you stop to remember that for most of us, we have to wait close to an hour after our plane lands just so we can use a restroom.  I have skipped using a restroom myself just so I have enough time to potty my SD and I can't use the restroom onboard a plane so for me it is either I wait or my SD waits if there is no relief area for him within that sterile area.

Thank you for allowing me to comment on this.",,,,,,,

I have been with a service dog for nine years, and fly often for business.  I find I must choose between booking direct flights that may be prohibitively expensive or do not exist and booking a layover of more than two hours so I have time to allow my dog to relieve herself and then re-enter the sterile area.  Such a lengthening of my trip comes at a great physical burden.

For the legislation to be effective:
1)	Relief areas must be outdoors, within sterile areas.  The physical strain as well as the time shortage of an extra trip through security exacerbates the difficulties of travel.  Most service dogs are trained to never relieve themselves indoors, and to contradict that training by an indoor relief area is counterproductive.

2)	Relief areas should be a minimum of one per terminal, reachable by wheelchair within a maximum of 10 minutes from each gate, 5 being preferable.  Disabled persons may be unable to cover distances with any speed, and may have to wait for other passengers to disembark or airport assistance personnel to arrive before deplaning.  I have been to airports that have a service animal relief area within a sterile area of the airport, but it is in another terminal requiring me to travel for 20+ minutes by several methods to reach it or requires that I exit security to change terminals.  At my final destination, I have been forced to choose between claiming my baggage or tending to my dog, only to find that my baggage has been removed by the time I arrive.

3)	The DOT should provide minimum guidelines for design and maintenance, but allow for flexibility to accommodate climate, material innovations, etc.

4)	Such areas should be adequately marked, identified on the airport website, and well publicized to staff.  Allowing a disabled person to feel empowered with their travel plans is a great asset and removes much of the stress that traveling produces.",,,,,,,

Summary of Comment:

1. Service dog relief areas need to be placed within the sterile areas of airports.  Relief areas outside the sterile area are practically useless to travellers, especially those with connections.

2. Relief areas in the sterile area should not be more distant than a 10-15 minute walk from all gates.

3. The relief area does not need to be huge, but it must be protected from adverse weather and temperature conditions.  It could be grass, faux grass, or mulch.

4. If pets are allowed to use the same area, special considerations need to be taken, such as giving priority use to service dogs (a front-of-the-line pass), a time limit on how long a dog can be using the area, and a prohibition against playtime taking place in the area.  Pet or service dog, only one dog must be allowed at a time for safety's sake.

5. The service dog relief areas should be clearly marked on maps, Web sites, and have some signage (including Braille signage) in the airports.

6. The relief areas could be paid for (construction and/or maintanence) by sponsor corporations/businesses in a deal worked out with each individual airport.

7. When the new rule is implemented, there needs to be oversight to ensure the relief areas are constructed and finished on time, unlike what happened with the previous rule about airports having a relief area anywhere on site.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2011-0182-0146/attachment_1.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2011-0182-0146/attachment_1.txt",

It is good that there are assistance dog relief areas, but it is difficult to get to them and back through the security check both because of the time it takes and because of the difficulty of physically managing the trek to the relief area and back.

It would be extremely helpful if there were a relief area for assistance dogs within the ""sterile area.""",,,,,,,

Please require airports to locate a minimum of one Service Animal Relief Area per terminal inside the ""sterile area"" between the TSA security checkpoint and the gate area.
        I am concerned that a number of disabled passengers could miss connecting flights due to the time and distance involved if a service animal relief area is located outside the sterile area of the terminal.  After a long trip to a relief area, the disabled passenger would have to go through a screening at the TSA security checkpoint before he or she is allowed to return to the gate area with a guide, hearing or service dog. 
        The service animal relief area should be located nearby to ensure time and distance are not barriers for disabled passengers. This could also result in assistance dog teams missing their flight. An assistance dog can suddenly have a digestive upset and/or become stressed by severe air turbulence or a thunderstorm during the flight and upon landing, urgently need a trip to a relief area so as to prevent ""an accident"" and to alleviate cramps.  Young or elderly assistance dogs and those on their first flight will need to eliminate more often than assistance dogs in their prime who are seasoned travelers. 
       The majority of assistance dog teams who are on the way to the gate or connecting with another plane or after landing at their destination before they get their luggage would be best served by a service animal relief area that can be accessed from inside the sterile area of each terminal.
        We ask airports that only have one service animal relief area for two or more terminals, believing there is no need for more since that one is rarely used, to take a second look at this problematic situation for disabled passengers. 
        Thank you for your atttention to this matter.

That day my service animal went 12 hours without relieving herself, and frankly I don't know how she did it.  There seem to be more and more disabled passengers with service animals flying every year, and it simply isn't possible to provide relief for these animals if it's necessary to go back outside the TSA clearance area to do so.

When we got to Seattle there was only one relief area and it was indoors, tiled, and smelled of disinfectant. (It looks exactly like the one in your photos.) My dog looked up at me as if saying, ""There's no dirt, no grass. What do you want me to do here?"" He's been trained not to go indoors, and he wouldn't. He ended up ""holding it"" until we got to Honolulu. This means he did not pee for about 13 hours. 

Animals need a place where they are comfortable relieving themselves and as their people, we need to have access to those places. In Seattle, for example, there is one relief area for (I believe) five terminals. If you have to take the tram to get to your terminal, once you do your animal has no place to relieve himself.

When you consider both the weather factor in the Winter and the TSA screening process, it is imperative that all airports be required to provide relief areas for assistance dogs inside TSA sterile areas.  Assistance dog users are currently placed at risk for missing connecting flights because now they must be re-screened as they are required to leave the sterile areas to toilet their dogs at most airports.  Additionally, mobility and sight disabilities put not only the dog at risk but also the disabled person, since most airports where I have landed don't have adequate toilet areas that are even accessible.

PTGDU supports the Department of Transportation's proposal ""to amend (49 CFR) part 27 by inserting a provision that would require airport operators to work with carriers to establish relief areas for service animals that accompany passengers with disabilities departing, connecting, or arriving at U.S. airports.""  Adoption of such rules will constitute a crucial reasonable accommodation for air-travelers with disabilities who travel with the assistance of a trained service dog. We further support these relief areas being located inside the sterile area of each terminal.

 

 Relief areas inside of the sterile area (inside of security) are desperately needed because connecting passengers cannot offer their guide dog relief as things are now because of a lack of opportunity to do so inside of the secured zone. 

 

The TSA suggested that airports offer authorized staff to escort a service dog handler outside of restricted areas to relieve their dog .  This could be a low-cost answer that could take effect immediately. 

 

PTGDU also wishes to affirm the efforts that TSA has made in clarifying that there is no security problem with service animal relief areas inside of the secured zone. 

 

PTGDU thanks the DOT for its efforts to help improve airport travel experiences for service dog handlers.

It is the reason that I no longer fly.  It is way too time comsuming to take my SD back out of the airport to relieve herself and get back to my gate. Its alot of walking for both of us.

It only makes sense to have them. I wouldn't want anyone's SD to have an ""accident"" when a flight is delayed or they are on a plane too long, due to weather or air traffic and the SD team just doesn't have enough time to make it back out of the airport once they can land.  Delays happen. People with SD's plan and schedule around their and the dog's needs.   

As an example, we are going on a cruise in January.  Instead of going to a major airport (DTW) and flying, getting there in a few hours, we will have to drive.  I cant sit for too long because of my back.  It will take me three days to drive, and cost more money, rather than a few hour flight.

Thank you kindly,

When we travel to other airports, we are often required to leave the sterile area to get outside, then stand in a long lines at security to go through screening again.  For someone with disabilities, this is quite difficult.

Because of the time it takes to get through the boarding process plus the length of the flight leading to the layover, skipping a relief period for Flynn is not an option.  Each time since I received Flynn as a service dog, I have called ahead to the airline and announced that I was bringing a service dog well ahead of time, and I have called to confirm within 24 hours of my flight, as well.  Still, my family has time to get everyone through the bathrooms, have a snack/meal, and are standing by ready to board the next flight by the time I can get back to them after finding Flynn relief.  At that time I have neither voided nor eaten myself, and I am exhausted.  Once the airport security brought me out to an unused landing strip for Flynn to find a patch of grass to use.  Other times, we had to go out to the bushes and back through security.  The airline representative even stated to me that she felt like this was a waste of time, she would rather just have Flynn void on the floor at the terminal (I found this distasteful, but even if that were the plan, Flynn never relieves himself inside of his own volition).  Airports should have relief areas for service dogs easily accessible to the terminals (by elevator or non-metal mesh steps for both the sake of the disabled person and the health of the dog's paws).  Please improve this situation, as I have begun to limit the length of air trips because of the issues with finding Flynn relief - and that means I do not have the same access to air flight as an abled person.

If I do find someone to help me and my dog to the service area we have to go out and come back through security again.  Since I have the dog and have a knee replacement we have to be patted down and this takes a while so I have come very close to missing my flight.  Since most service animals are curb trained a grass area outside isn't necessary.  Just a nice place at a curb on concrete works well.  If going out with a chaperone I think that once you have been through security once and someone was watching you all the time that TSA should bend their rule a little.  Its not like the blind lady and her dog met up with a terrorist or someone while outside under the scrutiny of someone leading them in and out.  I ferquently fly long distances and my poor dog has to go without water as she isn't able to get to the area designated and still be able to make the flights.",,,,,,,

I am requesting you mandate animal relief sections in the ""sterile area"" between the gates and TSA Security area in each terminal to allow our animals the opportunity to relieve themselves immediately after landing, especially after long flights. 

Additionally, I request you mandate a relief area as close as possible to the TSA Security Point on the ""Non-Sterile"" side so animals can relieve themselves before boarding. ideally these would be near the ticketing area(s).

These relief stations will not only reduce the number of accidents inside the building but are also the only humane way to treat these animals.

( 1 )     The issue for we service dog owners in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making is the question posed by the DOT on where to locate service animal relief areas.  The DOT is seeking input on whether service animal relief areas should be located inside or outside “the sterile area.”   The sterile area is understood to be the secure area between the TSA screening checkpoints and the gate area where passengers board or deplane the aircraft.
            
         We service dog owners thank DOT for this proposal seeking input for relief areas located outside the sterile area that in essence creates barriers for disabled passengers.
 Service dog owners urge DOT to require a minimum of one service animal relief area per terminal located INSIDE the sterile area to significantly reduce the time and distance for disabled passengers whose assistance dogs need to use the service animal relief areas.  Many times gates are over a quarter mile apart. We implore the DOT to require a centrally located relief area INSIDE the sterile area. If not possible, the airport could build two service animal relief areas inside the sterile area, one at either end of the terminal to ensure time and distance do not pose barriers for disabled passengers traveling with canine assistants.  These relief areas need to be located outdoors to the extent feasible, on the sterile side of the airport, something the TSA discussed in its Guidelines issued in May 2011.
        Owners believe service animal relief areas located inside the sterile area best serve the needs of the majority of disabled passengers with assistance dogs when on the way to the gate, changing planes or during a stopover and immediately after arriving at their destination before passengers have to collect ",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2011-0182-0223/attachment_1.doc,https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2011-0182-0223/attachment_1.pdf",

As a person with limited mobility, walking any distance over 50 metres is painful and the effects can last for days, further impacting on quality of life. If the airport can only provide one relief area, can consideration be given to a passenger transport service (ie wheelchair carrying airport golf buggy) that can be utilised at short notice to transport the person and their service animal to the sterile relief area? This will ensure that distance does not become a limiting factor and that persons who are not ambulatory or can only move at a slower speed than a normal walking pace will not miss their flight.

I have found these sometimes challenging to find and trying to find someone who knows where they are is sometimes challenging. 
At Denver Intl. Airport (DEN), about 4 years ago, no one could direct me to one of these relieving areas, maybe they did not exist then? Anyway, I tried to find a place, but my dog just would not go. Long story short, we flew to Jacksonville and it was a LONG time before he found a place to go.
I have not experiencded any problems with TSA agents checking my dog when I go through security. They do seem to check my dog inconsistently which is surpising, but of course there is nothing to be concerend with.

MSP has a relief area outside the baggage claim exit. To get there, I must use moving sidewalks and a monorail from the concourse. THERE ARE no maps or signs indicating how often the monorails travel or when they are due to arrive. I'm deaf, and I get panic attacks just trying to get my dog to the relief area AT MSP. I've had to beg airport personnel to SHOW ME instead of telling me where to go, because I can't understand them, and I can't remember where to go.
I've had to ask TSA to shortcut me through the security check just so I can get back in time to catch my flight.  It takes me 40 minutes to just get in and out of MSP for service dog relief, and a late flight can cut 2 hours' layover to nothing.MSP's relief area is very tiny and often foul.  MSP should have at least two to three relief spots on the main concourses inside the security zone. It's a major hub and it's HUGE. 
O'Hare: To get to the relief area, I must travel a long way,  exit the baggage claim, cross a wide road with many buses to get to a large field. It's hazardous even with a traffic-trained hearing guide dog, and there are distracting rabbits.
REROUTES: Once I was bumped up to an earlier flight and rerouted the long way, through Denver, which I didn't know.
When we disembarked I had to go find the baggage claim and then beg a hospitality volunteer to show me where the relief area was, immediately, because my dog was bursting and there was no time to waste.  It took 10 minutes for him to take me to a hill next to the parking garage.  This field was cluttered with dead pigeons.
It's so bad I've tried to train my dog to urinate down drains in handicap bathrooms instead; he won't.
I have never even found the relief areas at Dulles, LAX, or BWI, so I can't speak for these, but these airports also should have at least three service dog relief areas. ",,,,,,,

Travelers are rude and there is no help for your disabled passengers, making this an unpleasant experience.

Being disabled is challenging enough, without the airports making it more difficult for us.  Please support having ""potty"" areas inside the airport for our working dogs.  

You migh also take into consideration the cleaning of the areas that do exsist.  Most are filthy and not suitable for our animals.  These serviced dogs noses are so sensitive and the smells are distracting.  Areas should be desgined for only the use of the disabled with thier service dogs. 

In this country we are so concerned with being correct in treatment of so many - but the diabled are overlooked and discarded as valuable human beings.

I am partnered with a Service Dog, and my husband is partnered with an ESA. We fly at minimum 2-3 times a year, often not together. It is absolutely critical that Service Animal Relief Areas be located within the sterile area. Ideally, there should be one area per teminal. If it is not possible to create multiple areas, this area should be centrally located within the building. For airports that have satellite terminals, each terminal must have its own relief area. The location of the areas are critical because it is often impossible to make it to the relief area and back to your gate, even if it is within the sterile area. For example, when my husband and I traveled together recently, we were waiting for our flight to board. It had been several hours since the dogs had voided, and the next flight was 4.5 hours. We knew that the airport we were flying to did not have a relief area. The relief area (fortunately insude the sterile area) was on the other side of the terminal building, 3 terminals away. There was no way that my husband would make it. So I had to struggle across the airport in pain with 2 dogs. Both dogs were absolutely mortified at being asked to void indoors. I convinced them that it was okay. I got back to the gate, and everyone except my husband had boarded, and they wanted to close the gate. Given the limited flight options at certain locations, missing that flight might have meant not leaving until the next day. It was very stressful and painful.
It would be preferred to have an outdoor option within the sterile area because many dogs would get overly stressed if asked to eliminate on command in an indoor area as this is not a normal behavior for a service dog. This then creates stress for the disabled handler in an already stressful travel situation. It is a difficult situation to train. Preferred materials even for an indoor area include, grass, soil, wood chips, or small gravel to give an outdoor feel.",,,,,,,

As soon as we arrived, she told me she needed to take him to the dog park outside the airport so I went with her.  I was in shock when I realized how far they needed to go to get there. With a layover of 1 hour and 15 minutes I was a little concerned about us making the connection.  And when we came back into the building, we had to go back through security screening!  Fortunately, it was not a heavy travel weekend and were able to get through screening in enough time to make the long trek back to our gate and make our connection.

Service animal relief areas need to be provided on the ""sterile"" side of gate areas to allow people with service animals to take them between flights.  Air travel these days is stressful enough but to make these dog partner teams walk so far and make them go through TSA screening again is unfair.",,,,,,,

This is usually once/year. However, I also travel for other reasons and find myself on a plane at least one or two other times. I need to travel with my Service Dog Gryphon, who is now seven+ years old, but he's gone on every plane that I have since 2006. We must deal with as we travel the single-most obnoxious, frightening, and sweat-provoking stressor. Although I do walk with a cane at home, I can only do so for about a short city block [in extraordinary pain]. Therefore, I am in a wheelchair from the minute I enter a terminal. This alone makes traversing the airport something we fear terribly. Even the best-trained working dog has problems there. I have to yell to my dog ""Stay in a Heel"" to be heard over the noise. Then there are the people who walk into or onto him, talk to or distract him, and then we get to the gate, where he might show the first inkling he needs to toilet. Keep in mind I took him to the grass before entering the terminal. So, I'm really stressed about the time. I'll ask for someone at the gate to take him down to one of the toileting area since it's too far for me and I have to go thru security again, in addition to the pain. Even with some cue words to get him to ""do it,"" he is too scared to go. That means he will sit stiffly and painfully in the bulkhead beside my feet and those of others [some with bulging bags under the seat], all the while having to go numbers 1 & 2. I ask you, how long can you remain in one position on a cold metal floor without having an accident? Could you hold it for a minimum of 2 hours and 45 minutes? I didn't think so. There is such a need to have a sound and emission-free (or close to that) working dog toileting area at no less than every other gate. These dogs are HEROES, just like war veterans, to their ""disabled"" partners; some are like me, & can't do much on their own. Gryphon deserves more.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2011-0182-0236/attachment_1.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2011-0182-0236/attachment_1.pdf",

  I have had difficulties with that issue in the past myself. Barely made the flight and was worrying the whole time. Also I had difficulty finding the service dog relief area due to lack of directions or sign to guide me there. Was very fortunate to find a security person in airport who guided me there. So signs would be extremely helpful, along with on line map to relief area would be great to help with prior planning.

She is a single woman who lives alone, and she has been able to continue doing so, as the degree of her deafness increased, because she has a hearing dog.  She is one of 8 siblings, 6 of whom live in eastern Canada, whereas she lives in California.  Almost every year, there are family events and gatherings in the east, and until she got her hearing dog she was often unable to participate, because cross-country travel for a deaf person can be exceptionally difficult, especially in the event of flight delays or disruptiions due to weather or mechanical problems. 

But even with the hearing dog, my sister-in-law's travel  difficulties can be compounded if she is in an airport where the pet relief areas are limited or far from the terminal where she has landed or will depart.  This can be especially true when connecting flights are involved.

I understand that one of the purposes of the ADA is to allow our citizens with disabilities to be fully integrated into our fast-moving and complex society.  The regulation now being considered is one easy and relatively simple way to accomplish that end for people like my sister-in-law, but making it easier for them to be able to travel with their service dogs, to do without having to risk missing flights or other connections, and to do so without having to go through TSA screening more than once because of the unfortunate and inconvenient location of a pet relief area.

Thank you for giving consideration to my comment.  I have provided my e-mail address if there are any questions about my comment.

The best service animal relief areas are within the ""sterile area"" of the airport, not far from an exit/entrance door so that it is easily accessible within a timely manner, but also it should be not in the most busy area of the airport. I have seen covered areas with gravel located at one end of the terminal building, out-of-the-way of most passenger traffic, and this works very well. Some airports have a similar area with dirt or grass which also works well. The important thing is it cannot be more than a short distance (10-20 feet) from the terminal building or it will not be practical for most individuals to utilize.

What I anticipated this to be like and the reality of what came to be was completely different.  Although service animal relief areas are required, they are all outside of the airports, so, spite this consideration to provide something for us to access with our dogs to relieve them, there are barriers.  Currently, in order for me to relieve my service animal, I have to go outside of the secure area of the terminal, find the potty area, relieve my dog and then go back through the entire screening process again. 

This IS an unreasonable process to go through especially when rules are designed to help individuals with disabilities.  Since many airports are large and packed, flights can be missed easily!  Airports can be intimidating and stressful to start.  The first time I flew since having the service animal relief areas implemented I was very disappointed, after asking about 13 airport personnel where the designated area was, I was mislead by many who simply did not know, to finally realize it was outside passed security.  I no longer had time to relieve my dog, nor did I have a moment to sit and catch my breath, where if proper set up was placed, I would have been able to relieve my service dog, not have become stressed and would have been able to sit as the rest of the travelers get to experience.  My challenges are invisible, but I cannot imagine how person with mobility or vision challenges would have navigated their way through successfully since I could not spite my efforts. 

It is only reasonable to place relief areas within the terminals inside the security area somehow.  The space needs to me minimal, perhaps taking guidance and care as they are able to provide areas on cruises to accommodate.  When delayed overnight, I certainly was disgusted with the relief area in place in Detroit. Dirty, dark, isolated, unsafe and inconvenient...not cool!",,,,,,,

Currently if I am going to be flying for an extended period of time I have to allow for an extended layover so that I have enough time to leave the secure area, find the pet relieving area and make it back through security before my plane boards.  This often means I have to leave the terminal where I am and travel to the main terminal or parking lot to relieve my service animal. Often the areas where the relieving areas are located are not safe or are poorly lighted.  Many times the airport staff has no idea where the relieving area is located so a lot of time is spent just trying to find an area to relieve my Service Animal, all the time concerned about my next plane boarding and if my Service Animal is going to be able to hold it long enough to find the relieving area. 

If there were Service Animal Relieving areas passed security it would mean I could fly more efficiently and would feel more secure while relieving my Service Animal.

Please approve the rule that would make Service Animal Relieving areas a requirement in airports that receive federal funds. It would make those of us who travel with a Service Animal feel safer while traveling.

As a family member and primary caregiver I am urging the DOT to require airports to locate a minimum of one Service Animal Relief Area per terminal inside the ""sterile area"" between the TSA security checkpoint and the gate areas.

Those disabled that travel with an assistance animal have special needs.  The needs of a living creature need to be taken into consideration.  The dogs obviously have the biological need to relieve themselves at reasonable intervals.  

 For the disabled who are often unable to walk or travel as quickly as the average traveler, caring for the elimination needs of their animal becomes a very long, drawn-out and many times painful process of exiting the secure area, finding the relief area, then getting back through security and finally making it back to the boarding gate in time for the flight.

My family has had personal experience with this issue.  During a delay between connecting flights in Arizona, my wife nearly missed her flight because of this issue.  It took time to get directions to find the relief area.  When she obtained directions and found the area it was outside of the secure area.  It was a very long walk in order to get the service dog outside, then an extended process to get back through security.  By the time my wife was able to return to the gate area she was within seconds of the gate being closed and being left on the ground.

At one time it was rare to see a baby-changing station in a men’s room.  Now it is the norm.  Having a relief area for service dogs inside the secure areas and close to the various terminal gates would be a kindness to our disabled citizens, to the animals that provide service to them, and would improve the efficiency of passenger movement by reducing traffic through the TSA security checkpoints.",,,,,,,

As I travel alone on most occasions with my service dog, it means having to go back through security with all my carry on baggage, myself, my power wheelchair, etc. I believe the airports need to have relief areas with better signage and access to the person traveling with a service animal. There should be places inside the security zone in addition to outside this area so our animals can get relief coming and going and also while waiting especially if there are flight delays. We should not be inconvenienced because we have to travel with a service animal.",,,,,,,

On 11/15/2011, we flew a return trip along the same route.

I traveled with my service dog, Grace.  As for pet relief areas (of course, my service dog is not a pet), we only used the one at O'Hare.  It was a nice area and clean, but quite a ways from the gate area, outside of the airport.  I use a wheelchair for distance walking and I was with another friend with a guide dog.

We had to leave our arrival gate and make our way through the airport.  Thankfully, we had requested the wheelchair and help, so in both directions, we had a great support in place to get to the relief area.  Of course, we were carrying all our carry-on items the whole way.  

Once our dogs had finished relieving themselves, we had to go back througn the airport again, including going through security.  Since we were traveling with our dogs, the always set off the detectors at security because of their gear, which contained metal rings.  Since the dog set off the detector, I had to be patted down again both time we were in O'Hare.

The bottom line is that although a nice area was provided, it was outside and far from the gates.  Taking time to go through security again, being patted down again, scanning all our carry-on again caused stress and concerns about making our next flight.  By the time we reached the gate for our trip home, they were ready to start pre-boarding.  ",,,,,,,

49 CFR Part 27

RIN 2105-AD91
[Docket No. DOT-OST-2011-0182]

	I am for this regulation in all its parts, focusing on the service animal relief areas, of this regulation. This service area should be placed with in the sterile area of the airport and not just past security, within reasonable distance from any terminal or within each terminal depending on the size of the airport. With larger airports, it is often difficult for the average passenger to make flights, let alone the traveler with disabilities, when compounding that problem with the necessary care of the service animal many feel that travel is just not in the available options for them. Currently the list of service animal areas in the airports show that a number of large airports only have one or two for the massive area of the whole airport, with the most of them located outside the sterile area, which requires the traveler to go through the screening process at security. During heavy air travel traffic time such as holidays the screening process can take even longer than normal, and is an unnecessary delay for travelers with disabilities, in order to care for their working animals. If the relief area was with in the sterile area it also would be a benefit to other travelers with pets, which would benefit the airport and airlines with more revenue, therefore the cost does not outweigh the benefit to all and there is no reasonable objections.  
	The time line that is imposed on the airports to implement this regulation is reasonable of 120 days. Currently airports offer services that are not as important or vital to a number of travelers as the service of animal relief area with no problem, such as smoking lounges. If they are able to offer non vital services then it should be expected to offer these vital ones in a timely matter, with little delay. A small room with drainage and Astor turf would not take long to implement and set up, and maintaining ",,,,,,,

What I anticipated this to be like and the reality of what came to be was completely different.  Although service animal relief areas are required, they are all outside of the airports, so, spite this consideration to provide something for us to access with our dogs to relieve them, there are barriers.  Currently, in order for me to relieve my service animal, I have to go outside of the secure area of the terminal, find the potty area, relieve my dog and then go back through the entire screening process again. 

This IS an unreasonable process to go through especially when rules are designed to help individuals with disabilities.  Since many airports are large and packed, flights can be missed easily!  Airports can be intimidating and stressful to start.  The first time I flew since having the service animal relief areas implemented I was very disappointed, after asking about 13 airport personnel where the designated area was, I was mislead by many who simply did not know, to finally realize it was outside passed security.  I no longer had time to relieve my dog, nor did I have a moment to sit and catch my breath, where if proper set up was placed, I would have been able to relieve my service dog, not have become stressed and would have been able to sit as the rest of the travelers get to experience.  My challenges are invisible, but I cannot imagine how person with mobility or vision challenges would have navigated their way through successfully since I could not spite my efforts. 

It is only reasonable to place relief areas within the terminals inside the security area somehow.  The space needs to me minimal, perhaps taking guidance and care as they are able to provide areas on cruises to accommodate.  When delayed overnight, I certainly was disgusted with the relief area in place in Detroit. Dirty, dark, isolated, unsafe and inconvenient...not cool!

It  is discrimination against physically challenged people to make them go through security twice just because their service animals have to go to the bathroom and they have a connecting flight and that may cause them to miss the connection.

After asking multiple times to have someone please escort me and my dog to the tarmac so he could relieve, I decided to try to make it outside.  But unfortunately, due to a long flight, my poor dog was unable to make it and relieved in the middle of a busy terminal.  The woman who was escorting me was kind enough to get paper towels to help clean up the mess as well as paige for more assistance.  

It is unfair for service animals who must endure long flights to be denied a convenient place to empty within the confines of security.  When I prepare to fly I must feed my dog enough to settle his stomach but not too much.  He also gets a very minimal amount of water and a few ice cubes on our journey.  He never complains once but I can't begin to imagine the discomfort he endures simply because there is no place for him to empty.  

When I walk through an airport I notice that no one is denied an opportunity to use the restroom within security.  Why shouldn't service animals be given the same respect?",,,,,,,

It seems very outdated and even anti-handicapped.  Current  service animal relief areas are outside security areas making them a very difficult for people with disablilities to access.  If all restrooms were outside of the secured area and required re-examination for re-entry it would be obvious that this would be an untenable situation. 

It is reasonable to have a timely, safe and accessible way to relieve my service dog. Not having reasonable access leaves the handler with the real issue of meeting the service dogs true health and wellness needs, or possibly missing their flight due to distance and disability issues.  It would be the ethical and legally correct thing to create areas safe and accessible for service dog teams. My challenges are invisible, but I cannot imagine how person with mobility or vision challenges navigate throught the current offerings for relieving a service dog at an airport.

It is reasonable and necessary to place relief areas for service dogs within the terminals secured areas.  Service dogs need a minimal space and the means to dispose of waste in a sanitary manner.  People with Disabilities who use Service Dogs should have reasonable accomodation to care for their dogs while traveling. If it can be done on a cruise ship, accommodating this need for people with disabilities who have a service dog in an airport is not only practical, it is the only humane way to go.

I support the IAADP in asking the DOT to require a  minimum of one Service Animal Relief Area located inside the sterile area of each terminal.  The lack of these relief areas creates a sever handicap on those of us who travel with our Service Animals .  Due to my disability, walking long distances is painful and a time consuming endeavor.  Providing this Relief Area would make travel more accessible to a large part of the population.  

I also believe that signs and maps should be clearly marked with the location of all Service Animal Relief Areas.  Please help those of us who through no fault of our own, rely on our Service Animals for our mobility and the ability to travel.

I am disabled and travel with a service dog.  I was thrilled to find a relief area within the sterile area at SeaTac but that turned to dismay once we tried to use it.  All that was provided were small potty pads.  My service dog is a Golden Retriever and doesn't use potty pads.  If she did, I could easily carry them myself and use the ladies room!  It seem like they were catering to people with small pet dogs (and how these areas are being marketed, this one even said ""Pet Relief Area""), not working service animals which tend to be the larger breeds.  At that point my dog is looking at me like ""you want me to do what, where?"" and I didn't know where the nearest relief area outside the sterile area was because we were directed to the one within it.  

I believe that the inside areas should use fake grass.  There are systems out there that have sprinklers and draining capabilities like the Porch Potty which would make maintenance easier.  Dog owners pick up the solid waste and liquid is rinsed through and can be directed through a hose to a floor drain. http://www.porchpotty.com/  

I wonder if relief areas could be a part of the regular people bathrooms with it's own stall or a separate one with a door like the family bathrooms.  Perhaps one or two family bathrooms could be re-purposed.  That would be ideal with a sink for washing your hands (there wasn't one in the SeaTac one) and you wouldn't have to worry about coming in contact with an uncontrolled pet dog in the area itself which is always a worry with a service animal.  I've heard of untrained, stressed out pet dogs and emotional support animals lunging at and attacking a service animal. 

Thank you for allowing people with service dog to comment.",,,,,,,

As someone with a service animal I would like to see a requirement of a minimum of one Service Animal Relief Area located inside the sterile area of each terminal so that time and distance do not impose a hardship on those of us who travel with assistance dogs.

When I have taken flights there are no clearly marked relief ares for service dogs within the security check ares. When I have connecting flights I am unable to go outside security check points and make it back inside the secured area before my connecting flight leaves. With travel being more and more convenient for the disabled we are flying more. But, with no conveniences for our service dogs being considered we often have to rethink our plans. If you would make it so EVERY airport in the US has a service dog relief area INSIDE check points THAT would be FANTASTIC and would allow us to travel more comfortably. It doesn't have to be a big area, just big enough for a big dog to potty in. Most service dogs are trained to relieve themselves on command so it wouldn't have to be too big. Most of us disabled folks are trained to pick up after our dogs too so it SHOULDN'T require any work on your part other than providing our much needed dogs with a decent place to relieve themselves INSIDE security check. Thank you for reading this. I hope this matter is addressed and is fixed soon. It would really make our travel a LOT easier!",,,,,,,

The animals cannot always wait for their slower moving persons to take them outside the airport, and then to ask the disabled person to go back through security is discriminating against them, and making missing their flights so much more likely.

For example, a trip from Philadelphia to Portland on Southwest Airlines may well involve two or more connecting flights with layovers that range from 30 minutes to 1 hour and involve moving from moving from one set of gates to another. Even if the layover is one hour, getting outside the security perimeter and back in time to board the flight is problematic at best.

People who require service animals need to be accommodated in the secure areas of our nation's airports. Disabled people have a right to travel independently, and should not be forced to leave and reenter the secure area to relieve their service animals. The way that our airports are set up today needlessly prevents many people with service animals from being able to travel by making connecting flights with short layovers impossible.

My mother is visually impaired, and our family has experienced firsthand how people with disabilities are seriously impacted by the current state of affairs.

The TSA has asserted that there is no negative security impact in providing relief areas past security. I urge you to address this issue, and require that our airports accommodate people with service animals at all terminals.

Thank you for addressing this important issue, and for working to provide reasonable accommodation to all of our nation's travelers, disabled or not.

Our family submitted a comment a few days ago, but over the weekend, I learned something which absolutely impacts persons with disabilities who are traveling with emotional service animals from the mainland to the State of Hawaii, specifically, if you miss a connecting flight from the mainland going into the State of Hawaii.
I am attaching the information I was provided.  Our family almost missed a connecting flight from DFW to Maui, Hawaii this past summer.  We are returing in two weeks and I felt I needed a back-up plan in case we missed a flight in the future. The attachment goes into detail as to what the State of Hawaii's Animal Quarantine officials advised me what could occur in such a circumstance.
I hope information such as this will help reinforce the need for a rule requiring the animal relief areas inside the sterile/secured areas between TSA and gates, in at least every terminal.

As a disabled handler of an assistance dog, and as a relatively frequent consumer of air travel, I can attest to the additional and unique challenges of traveling with a living assistive device.  

Although I make every effort possible to schedule my flights with the extra time required between the two to three legs I travel, I find it increasingly difficult due to the airlines' tighter scheduling. I am often faced with these choices: Withholding food and limit water intake to the possible discomfort of my assistance dog; risk an accident in the airport; pay nearly double fares to get the exact planes necessary to make time;  miss my flight and incur a $75-150 rescheduling fee and huge delays, resulting in further discomfort for both myself and my assistance dog.

Having the same relief that their handlers are provided will help ensure the professional working habits of assistance dogs.  It will alleviate further challenges created by the airlines' increasingly tight schedules.  Requiring relief areas within sterile zones will allow assistance dog teams to travel without additional hardship and will avoid the combined cost to airport, airline, and consumer of flight rescheduling or accidents within the terminal. 

I ardently support the passage of this requirement. ",,,,,,,

I understand the need for security and I would be willing to have an escort accompany me in and out out of the sterile area.  Providing an escort is necessary when trying to reach a relieving area quickly.  Along with educating the staff about where to relieve my dog, providing signage for sighted guides would allow me to quickly find the relieving area.

I have visited a variety of service dog relief areas during my travels, some very good, and some very bad. 

I strongly feel that service dog relief areas need to be available both within and outside of the security area. My dog needs to relieve herself when we arrive at the airport or leave the airport, so having one outside of baggage claim would be helpful.

I like to arrive early for flights so my dog and I can settle in before the gate area becomes very populated. We can't do this if I cannot take her to relieve herself just before a flight. At this point I have a choice--wait outside security until the last minute so I can take her to the relief area outside the secured area, or go through security to the gate, knowing it will be a long time before she has the opportunity to relieve herself. 

I almost missed a flight because she needed to relieve herself. Thankfully, a very nice security agent waited for me and walked me through security when we returned from the relief area. 

Individuals with disabilities need to be assisted in regard to service dogs; not penalized. We would all much rather be in a position in which we were healthy and did not need service dogs.",,,,,,,

Open Doors Organization has spent much time with its consultants in creating a Guideline for SA Relief Areas and recommends the DOT review this guide for this proposal (attached).  
Some additional suggestions are as follows: 

Regarding distance and location: As people walk at different speeds, blind and sight impaired passengers must wait for an escort, and indoor traffic and obstacles such as moving carts vary, using a performance requirement most likely wouldn’t work, and we recommend using a distance requirement of ¼ mile instead.  Being that most animals are trained to relieve themselves inside but handlers do not want to encourage this behavior, we suggest you require locating SARAs outside or inside with outdoor materials (grass) but maintaining this design can be too costly.  Creating an outside area that is closed off yet inside the sterile area is a design we’ve been recommending for a few years, but seems to be harder to implement.   120 days in some cases is perhaps unreasonable, and ODO suggests 6-12 months depending on airport size and budget (however all airports were required to have at least one SARA by May of last year). 

We feel that maintaining these areas to be clean is a must. 

We also feel that all US and foreign carriers should indeed be required to assist the passenger should that be needed, with a maximum wait time of 15 minutes, as well as maps provided in all their literature.  Airports should also provide in-terminal maps.  

We also feel that fences can create barriers for many PWD, and should not be in your requirements. 

Again, our guide for airports is attached. 



2. In regard for Captioning for passengers in terminals: ODO agrees that 30 days is reasonable, and that captioning should be required.  We also support simultaneous transmission of the information through PIDS, and suggest a 2-year 100% implementation for all airports, no matter the size.

I started out working for a major air carrier and later transitioned into a travel consultant. I am currently operating a travel resource site in which I provide travel information, resources and reviews for my readers. I have just recently begun to travel with a service dog. Immediately I found this to be quite a hassle when people and places are not very accommodating.  This led me to start a new project and website titled ""Have Service Dog Will Travel"". In my research I came across this rule proposal by the Dept. Of Transportation. I was already studying relief areas for dogs in airports, among other places. My actual proposal to you is that I would like to get personally involved in the process of evaluating the need for service dog relief areas in airports. I would like to do this in a  consultant capacity. I already travel and I have a service dog and I feel I understand the needs that have to be met. I also understand the workings of an airport and an airline both in the public sense and behind the scenes. My immediate reaction is that not all situations in all airports are identical so the new rule or regulation would need more tailoring than one would expect at first thought. I will be forwarding a more formal request to speak with someone in regards to my proposal. Thank  you in advance for your consideration.

Person who has had to leave sterile areas to provide my service animal relief I have found it difficult both physically and time wise being able to do so with adequate time to catch my connecting flight even when factoring in multiple hour layovers for this purpose.

I not only feel that there should be at least one location within the sterile areas for service animal relief stations but such should be clearly marked on maps along with a map provided at each area where a passenger enters the airport, deplaned or boards. Escort service and even transportation should be available on request.

As it is not a modification that can happen over night there should be a plan in place at each airport to provide escort service to a suitable location in the interim. In addition in such cases where it becomes necessary to leave sterile areas a secure locked area should be provided to leave carry on baggage before leaving the sterile area.

I remember a trip a few years ago when every delay possible seemed to happen. My original flight out of home was delayed for three hours. My connecting flight was set to leave only 10 minutes after we landed and I was lucky to even make that flight. Then due to weather we were in a holding pattern for over an hour and half before being diverted to an other airport. 

When we landed we were advised not to leave the terminal as our departure would be announced at any minute and if we were not there we would need to purchase a new ticket. The piolet was kind enough to offer to take my service animal out on the tarmac for me but she was too concerned for me to be able to relax and relieve herself

Later a foreman did escort me to a suitable location so my service animal might have some relief. It had been nearly 13 hours since she had been able to do so. To get to this location it was necessary for mr to carry my checked luggage down then back up 2 flights of steep stairs despite my mobility difficulties",,,,,,,

I thankfully don't require a service animal and seldom travel by air, BUT this would seem like a no-brainer to me. I never thought about it before, since I don't have or need a service dog...but it could happen to anyone that they DO need one at some point. I am a dog lover and I can say without doubt that most well trained dogs would rather die than mess where its not allowed, but they have physical needs like people and it is just as painful for a dog to hold its business as it is for a person. What could it hurt to provide facilities for the relief of an animal just before they get on the plane? Would you rather they do their business on the plane after takeoff if they could not hold it? As a passenger, I know I WOULD RATHER they have a place near the plane to relieve themselves before they get on! Thank you in advance for having some common sense in this matter. ",,,,,,,

Forcing disabled persons to leave to relieve their dogs, then come back through security is inexcusable. Major airports will likely require one in each terminal (LAX, DEN, etc), but smaller airports could likely get by with one or two.

It's hard enough to get through security checkpoints once per trip when you're disabled. To have to do it multiple times for the sake of your dog makes a bad situation worse, and it puts undue hardship on both dog and handler. Additionally, it adds congestion to already understaffed and overcrowded security lines, which isn't fair to anyone involved.

Signage should be a basic requirement and should be no different than posting directional signs for food, bathrooms, or departure gates.

Please, for the sake of dogs and handlers, mandate these changes. It can only have positive effects on the nation's travel and our sense of equality and compassion for others.",,,,,,,

We spent hours trying to arrange another flight (my husband is a very sick person requiring dialysis, which we had to rearrange for also) and we could not get another flight until the next day, which cost us a considerable amount of money we did not plan to spend, even with the discount offered to us by the airline.

As a manual wheelchair user, having to time the relief of my service dog before and between flights is often quit difficult. Traveling through the security check point often requires more time and inconvenience for me. Being unable to stand, I will always require a physical pat down. In addition, I am usually the first boarded onto an airplane and the last to deplane. Not having a service animal relief area in the sterile area means potentially extra hours of time between bathroom breaks for my dog. For cross country flights, this can mean quite long length of time before between relief breaks.

In addition, having to leave the sterile area for animal relief puts me at risk of missing my connecting flight. The difficulty and amount of time required to go through screening often is longer than airlines schedule for their passengers and since it is already difficult for me to move quickly, this can be prohibitive.

I also think it's worth pointing out that by requiring a service animal relief area within the sterile area, you will be helping TSA security and efficiency.

Each time I travel through the security check-point requires a halt in screening of able bodied passengers, then requires an extra person to perform a lengthy pat down. By reducing the number of times I need to pass through security, you are reducing the same number of wheelchair screenings required of TSA agents. Fewer screenings directly means fewer slow downs and better security.

In addition to making flying accessable for service dog handlers, it will benifit all passengers with better efficiency and safer travel. I believe it to be a win for everyone.

Sincerly,

I am a Guide Dog user and frequent many airports in this nation. I live in Alaska and have to travel out of the state on occasion. As you know you must travel a lot to get to the contiguous US.By the time I get to any connecting airport, it already has been up to 6 1/2 hours. That is a long time and that is just the first leg of the flight. HNL has made a great strides in this. They have a very easy place for this. SEA is looking into changing what they currently have, but have not made any improvements at this date. I know have to schedule at least 4-5 hour layovers between connections to relive my Guide Dog. It is so simple to accommodate this situation. At SEA I have given them suggestions to make that is at little or no cost. ATL, ORD, & ANC have not shown any interest in remedying this matter. Please give this some attention. This so easy to remedy. Thank you, Bryan Gearry.",,,,,,,

I have had to leave the terminal to toilet my dog and go all thru security again, needlessly.  I believe it is as essential to have a relief area for service dogs in each terminal as much as public toilets are provided, more so because so many of us are so limited, not forgetting the many wounded warriors that return from deployment with not only PTSD, but missing limbs, etc. It is a reality today that airports should and other facilities to travel should be required to accomodate service dog teams. Please try to put yourselves in our place and imagine the difficulties of even small efforts.  Thank you.",,,,,,,

I just traveled from CA to CT with my service dog.  Being disabled I have no chance in the 30 minutes I had to get my service dog out through security, to relief area (if there even is one) outside and then back through the security line.  To go through security I have to take off all of his vests, harness, leash act to get through without beeping.  I can barely walk without him and doing this in a 30 minute time crunch is impossible.  Even with a longer lay-over it's just too hard for me to do this.  My dog is well trained and will not go inside but as he gets older I am afraid.  Please please I am begging you to pass this with no objections.  Being disabled is hard enough but to have to worry about where to take him, going through security is just too hard.  I implore you do pass this measure.  I am available to come and speak if necessary ",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2011-0182-0331/attachment_1.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2011-0182-0331/attachment_1.pdf",

Due to the need to wait for assistance off the plane and to my next flight, not only was there no time to take Hazel for a break but I missed my flights.  Relief areas need to be in ea. airline terminal in the sterile zone.  Hazel ended up 'holding it for 15 hours!!!",,,,,,,

One terminal I frequent has gates that are literally over a half-mile apart from each other, still in the same terminal.  It is a very long walk!  Almost always, my flights leave from the gates that are over a half-mile from security.  If I were to have a connecting flight at this terminal and the gates were near each other but the only service dog relief area was a half-mile from them, that would be very hard to get to.  As it is, I have to use the moving sidewalks just to be able to walk the half-mile-long corridor that runs in between sections of the terminal, otherwise I would arrive at my gate out of breath, breathing from my mouth for the next ten minutes as I sat at the gate (I know because it happened the first time I used this terminal).  (A relief spot cannot be put in that corridor because it is underground, so if there was only one spot, it would be at either end.  Therefore, a terminal like this needs to have two relief spots, one at either end, where it wouldn't take more than fifteen minutes to get to the relief areas from any gates in the same end.)  Thank you!",,,,,,,

Planning these trips can be difficult. I try not to have a total flight time over 6 hours so that I can ""potty"" my service dog on the way into the airport and on the way out of the airport. 

This often means I have overnight stays in cities that are not my destination. For example, to fly from the east to west coast, I have to build in a stop in the midwest. This adds travel time and cost.

Delays are horrible - especially when they ask you to stay in the gate area in case they get clearance to load and take off quickly. There are always plenty of human restrooms nearby, but I risk missing my flight if I try to take my dog outside the sterile area to relieve himself.

Having a service dog relief area within a 10 minute walk of every gate would be a huge improvement! Remember that many of those using service dogs are doing so because of difficulty getting around. What would be a 10 minute walk for a regular passenger, might take 20-30 minutes for someone who has to walk slowly due to a disease like MS (multiple sclerosis), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), or severe arthritis.

When I get to a service animal rest area, I want the surface to be non-skid (a safety issue for my dog and those with mobility challenges). I would like it to be easy to clean (maybe a poured surface with a drain in the center). I realize grass is difficult indoors and to keep clean, but maybe some tiny gravel or shavings would work. (I used to clean up at a yearly dog show in the Atlantic City Convention Hall. They would put a 6' x 12' chain link pen and add a layer of shavings. The dogs would relieve themselves on the shavings. It was easy clean up and would be easy to periodically totally replace.)

Thanks for considering my suggestions.",,,,,,,
