We recently met with Dan Wolf, CEO of Cape Air and were most impressed with his honest answers to our questions and concerns. Mr. Wolf did not promise anything he and his company cannot deliver on. We basically found Cape Air to be consistent throughout the process, their proposal has remained unchanged since presented to the USDOT. 

The one area we would like to see addressed is a possible code-share with American Airlines in St. Louis. I believe AA is willing to work with Cape Air to make this possible.

I will be sending a formal letter of recommendation to Mr. Dennis DeVany of USDOT supporting the selection of Cape Air for the Quincy EAS service.

Re:	Comments on Medicare Program; Proposed Hospice Wage Index for 
Fiscal Year 2010; Proposed Rule; 74 Fed. Reg. 18912 (April 24, 2009), CMS-1420-
P
Dear Sir or Madam:
I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Proposed Hospice Wage Index 
rule for FY2010, issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”)  
My comments are specifically directed to the section entitled “FY 2010 Hospice 
Wage Index”.
	As the Director of Counseling Services of a hospice program, I have a 
substantial interest in the proposed changes to the Medicare hospice wage index 
for fiscal year 2010.  Hospice is an exceptional benefit that combines the 
attributes of excellent patient care and demonstrated cost savings to the Medicare 
program.  A recent independently conducted (funded under a grant from the 
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation) study conducted by Duke University 
demonstrated that hospice use reduced Medicare spending by an average of 
$2,309 per beneficiary.  These cost savings, when spread across the entire 
hospice patient population, result in a net reduction in end of life care expenses in 
excess of $2 billion. Over and over, I hear from the family members of patients that 
we serve that they wish they had known about hospice sooner.  
FY 2010 Hospice Wage Index
I strongly disagree with the proposed elimination of the Budget Neutrality 
Adjustment Factor (“BNAF”) used in the computation of the hospice wage index.  
After Congress stepped in, and delayed implementation of the first year of this 
regulation, the next phase of this implementation is projected to reduce Medicare 
hospice payments by 3.2% for fiscal year 2010, beginning October 1, 2009.  A 
reduction of 3.2% may not seem significant, but it needs to be put into the proper 
context.  A June 2008 report by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 
(“MedPAC”), found that overall hospices’ Medicare margins were only 3.4%, and 
such a cut will result in many hospices operating in a deficit.  This reduction will 
have a significant negative impact on hospice programs in my community and 
around the country.  Many hospices will be forced to institute hiring and wage 
freezes and in some cases layoffs and wage reductions. With the unemployment 
rate approaching 10% around the country, this course of action seems extremely 
imprudent and contrary to the current Administration’s goal of preserving jobs and 
stimulating growth.
As a senior leader in my program, I will have no choice but to reduce my service 
area, reduce staffing levels, cut back on services or undertake other drastic 
actions to absorb these unwarranted and ill-conceived reimbursement cuts.  
Currently, we plan to (insert your planned actions regarding staffing, service areas, 
etc.)
I strongly encourage CMS to withdraw the proposed elimination of the BNAF, 
particularly at this time in light of the fragile state of the Unites States economy.  
The same rationale used by Congress and President Obama in enacting the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which delayed the original 
implementation date of the phase-out of the BNAF, still applies in today’s 
economic climate.
I appreciate the opportunity to submit comments.
					Sincerely,

					Terri C. Ray, MA, LPC

need to have the information corridors opened so that drug and alcohol abusers
cannot get through the cracks.  We need to be able to identify these people
before they are accepted for employment.  Once they are on the rolls they become
a liability.  We need to know if they were released from employment from their
last employer for drug and/or alcohol related problems so that we might assess
this before hiring a new employee.  It's like hiring from a grab bag with a
blindfold on because information becomes so sensitive that no one can relay it
or receive it. Possibly, before placing new regulations into the mix we could
also implement a national register where employers can find out about a persons
past work history before making a hiring decision.  Similar to the register of
sex offenders that can be found on the internet.  We need a way of looking at
what a person has done because the truth is hard to come by when a person is
broke and in need of a job.",,,,,,,

Please adopt strict, enforceable regulations to protect airline passenger rights
to be treated with dignity and fairness.

The airline industry has shown time and again to be incapable of self regulation
in this area.  Therefore, the Federal government must step in and develop
strict, common sense regulations which apply to ALL airlines mandating the the
health, wellbeing and rights of passenger will be protected.

I do not believe the three hour tarmac time frame outline in the proposal is
acceptable.  It should be shortened to a maximum of two hours.  Airlines who
have knowledges of departure delay issues should be restricted from boarding
passengers until these are completely resolved.  Airlines should be responsible
for reasonable accommodations who incur complication with connecting flights. 
Passengers must be provided avenues of timely reporting and redress, including
full refund of all travel related expenses.

Agency oversight must include timely reporting, prominent posting of passenger
rights and strict penalties for non-compliance.

It is both time and appropriate that the airlines be held to a higher standard
for passenger rights and carrier responsibility.  The Federal government must be
the ones to actively impose these standards, ensure they are strictly enforced
and severely penalize  non-compliance.

Thank you",,,,,,,

treatment of passengers.  The industry is opposed to meaningful regulation and 
instead favors self regulation.  The fact of the matter is that the industry has had 
years to correct its shortcomings, but hasn’t done so.  In fact, industry 
performance has gotten worse and passenger satisfaction has declined in recent 
years.  I would favor a more comprehensive rulemaking procedure in which the 
DOT created industry wide minimum standards rather than allowing individual 
airlines to create their own plans of response.  Barring that, I believe DOT should 
move forward with the proposed rules.
The airline industry’s contention that the free market will drive the players in the 
industry to meaningfully self-regulate is absurd.  The industry is too consolidated 
with a few airlines providing the majority of flights in many regions of the country.  
There are insufficient competitive forces to provide consumers with the options 
necessary to choose one airline over another because one provides better delay 
contingency plans than another.  This is not an efficient market, consumers 
cannot readily use demand side pressure to force airlines to change.  Regulation 
in this field is appropriate.
It is amazing how so many of the airlines and airline associations can pay lip 
service to the need for a passenger’s bill of rights and the assurance that they 
have their own protective systems in place.  Yet at the same time, they are 
unwilling to make guarantee these procedures contractually for fear of liability?  It 
would seem to me that liability would only ensue if the airlines failed to meet their 
own policies and procedures.  And if they are committed to the ideals embodied in 
those policies, this would only occur on rare occasions.  If the airlines are 
unwilling to stand by their individualized procedures enough to risk liability, then 
following those plans must not be a high priority for the airlines.  It seems logical 
that, this being the case, external pressure in the form of liability for breach of 
contract, would be a suitable means of inducing the airlines to make customer 
satisfaction a priority.  
Please go forward with these rules and protect consumers from abussive use of 
power by the airlines.  Thank you for your time.

would invoke the carriers' obligations under their contingency plans.  I support
both standards: the maximum time that would trigger the plan, and the maximum
time after which carriers would be required to allow passengers to deplane. 
These uniform standards are necessary to ensure that the carriers create
effective contingency plans - not merely plans that minimize their costs. 
Currently, the DOT proposes to exclude any uniform standards from the final rule
because ""the Department should not substitute its judgment in this area for that
of the air carriers.""  The DOT currently regulates nearly every aspect of the
business and operations of commercial carriers. The argument that the DOT should
not step in ""in this area"" - protecting passengers - is misplaced.  A simple
provision that sets a maximum time interval is not interfering in the technical
decisions of the carriers.  While, as the ATA asserts, contingency plans ""must
be tailored to fit"" each carrier's ""facilities, equipment, operating procedures
and network,"" setting a time interval does not substantially invoke any of these
concerns.  Whether an airline has a three hour deplaning requirement set by the
DOT, or a three and a half hour interval set by its own internal contingency
requirement will not impair the airline's operations or ability to be flexible
under different weather and airport capacity limits.  But setting a uniform DOT
limit will significantly benefit the traveling public.  Passengers will know
that no matter the specific airline they have selected, they are entitled to
certain rights within a known time while sitting on the tarmac.  Perhaps a few
passengers out of a thousand read the specific carrier's contract of carriage,
but a uniform industry standard set by the DOT would quickly become common
knowledge among travelers.  This knowledge in turn would force the airlines to
live up to contingency plans in the contracts.  

As a specific recommendation for the time intervals, I believe that after one
and a half hours, the carriers should be required to discharge their obligations
under their contingency plans.  And after three hours, passengers should be
permitted to deplane.  Of course, this second requirement can still have some
built in flexibility.  Some discretion should be left in the hands of pilots to
decide whether to return to the gate.  But this does not mean that the
discretion cannot be standardized across the industry.  If a plane is, in the
ATA's hyperbolic scenario, ""the next in line to take off,"" the pilot would not
be required to return to the gate.  And of course, if a plane were quarantined
for health reasons, passengers would not be permitted to deplane.  But these
kind of rare cases can easily be dealt with in the final rule, while still
adopting a uniform standard that benefits travelers.  ",,,,,,,

proposed rule to enhance airline passenger protections.  Passengers and airlines 
alike will benefit from giving increased clarity and predictability to airline travel.  
While many of the specific provisions of this rulemaking might seem like common 
sense measures for airlines to adopt, in some cases they have not been adopted 
by airlines on their own. It is time that the Department of Transporation makes sure 
airlines have reasonable procedures in places for dealing with unforeseen, adverse 
circumstances, and that they clearly communicate these contingency plans and 
procedures to their passengers upfront.  This will go a long way toward making air 
travel more humane for those of us who regularly use it. 

It is not enough to rely on market forces to correct poor customer service. When 
inadequate checks on bad planning and procedure are in place, mere 
inconvenience can become a much more serious problem for all passengers.  
Though complying with these changes will likely involve some cost to the airlines, 
customers will be much more willing to travel by plane if they know that these 
safeguards are in place and they know what they are.  A rulemaking by the DOT is 
an appropriate means of assuring that there is a floor of decency in customer 
service below which no airline can sink.

General Comments

DOT is seeking comment on whether it should adopt a rule to enhance airline 
passenger protections by requiring carriers to adopt contingency plans for lengthy 
tarmac delays and incorporate them in their contract of carriage; require air 
carriers to respond to consumer problems; deem operating a chronically delayed 
flight to be unfair and deceptive; require carriers to publish delay data; require 
carriers to publish complaint data; require on-time performance reporting for 
international flights; and require carriers to audit their compliance with their 
customer service plans.

The comments below are generally similar to those submitted by NBTA on 
January 22, 2008.  Generally NBTA believes that customer service is a market-
driven issue, with purchasers able to make informed buying decisions based on 
facts related to airline service.  As certain types of information are only in the 
possession of air carriers, NBTA generally supports greater transparency and 
reporting requirements so long as such requirements provide useful information to 
the airline passenger and/or their purchasing agent and can be conducted with 
reasonable costs.  Certain parts of the proposals in the proposed rule, however, 
do not meet that test.  Moreover, while NBTA believes the federal government has 
an interest in mandating certain baseline consumer protections for airline 
customer service—or “passenger rights”—in general, airlines are in a much better 
position to ascertain what their customers expect and whether certain practices 
are worth the cost they entail.  Basic economics dictate that government 
mandates create private sector costs, and those costs are going to be borne, 
directly or indirectly, by the traveling public.

Contingency Plans
DOT seeks comment whether an air carrier operating a domestic service should 
be required to develop and publish a contingency plan for long ground delays on 
the tarmac for all its flights and incorporate this plan into the contract of carriage.  
Were this required, DOT indicates that passengers would gain the opportunity to 
sue an airline if the airline did not abide by that plan.  Carriers would be required to 
retain for two years information related to on ground delays that lasted for at least 
four hours.  

NBTA does not support generally requiring carriers to develop and publish 
contingency plans.  While NBTA supports carriers developing contingency plans 
and adopting recommendations set forth by the DOT Tarmac Delays Task Force, 
actions regarding use and implementation of such plans should not be required by 
regulation.  NBTA believes that airlines that fail to adopt or utilize contingency 
plans are extremely likely to provide poor service to passengers in lengthy delay 
situations, and such carrier are likely to be considered a much less desirable 
travel option.  Unfortunately, the causes of any specific lengthy tarmac delay is 
likely to be a combination of fact-specific occurrences related to weather, 
mechanical problems, or other factors.  We continue to believe that an airline, 
working through its pilot with local air traffic control and airport operators, is more 
likely to resolve a tarmac delay in a manner most beneficial to the largest number 
of passengers, than trying to resolve through previously-prepared scenarios.

For a market driven approach to be effective, NBTA does support requiring airlines 
to maintain and publish descriptions of lengthy tarmac delay situations.  


Response to Consumer Problems

The proposed rule seeks comments on a series of new requirements for air 
carriers to respond to consumer complaints.  These proposals would require air 
carriers to designate an employee at every airport who is responsible for 
monitoring the effects of flight delays, flight cancellations, and lengthy tarmac 
delays on passengers and who has input on decisions such as which flights are 
subject to the longest delays.  Air carriers would also be required to publish all 
information necessary for filing a complaint with the airline.  Finally, airlines would 
be required to send a response to each consumer complaint it receives within 30 
days.  

NBTA feels that this type of micromanagement of airlines customer service is 
unnecessary to meet the needs of business travelers.  Most, if not all, airlines 
have customer service departments specifically designed for this type of mission 
and have specific managers to handle key client needs.  Regulating a well-
established practice would unnecessarily burden the air carriers and create 
duplicative and redundant services.  How carriers respond to flight cancellations 
and other service problems is a key factor by which purchasers make their buying 
decisions.  Therefore, NBTA believes that diverting attention away from this 
business relationship to meet government-mandated solutions would be an 
unproductive endeavor.  

The cost of creating new customer service positions at each airport is also of 
great concern to NBTA.  Requiring airlines to enhance their physical customer 
service at airports may divert resources from customer service methods, such as 
customer service available by Internet or phone, that are more efficient for carriers 
to administer.  
 
Chronically Delayed Flights as Violations

The proposed rule would require a ‘chronically delayed flight’ as a flight that 
operates at least 45 times per quarter and is more than 15 minutes late 70% of 
the time.  

NBTA supports this new proposal as a helpful “bright line” standard that will force 
air carriers to meet baseline performance standards in order to advertise a flight.  
The proposed rule accurately states: “Consumers’ reliance on chronically 
inaccurate schedules works in their detriment both personally and professionally.”  
One of the key recommendations made by the DOT Inspector General’s office at 
several Congressional hearings was to provide DOT the tools and recourses to 
adequately pursue passenger’s rights issues.  NBTA supports adding this 
additional legal tool to the Secretary’s disposal. 

Require Carriers to Publish Delay Data on their Web Sites

The proposed rule would require airlines and travel agencies to provide on-time 
performance information on their websites as part of customers’ online 
transactions for purchasing tickets.  

NBTA supports requiring carriers to provide performance data to prospective 
purchasers so long as these requirements are aligned with performance reports 
that carriers must file with DOT.  NBTA recognizes that DOT is conducting an 
additional rule-making related to flight delays, and encourages DOT to align the 
requirements that might emerge from that rule-making with any new mandates in 
this area.  

Require Carriers to Publish Complaint Data on their Web Sites

The proposed rule would require that carriers publish an aggregate count of 
specific complaints filed by passengers on their Web sites.  

While NBTA appreciates the spirit of advancing transparency in the rule, requiring 
an air carrier to specifically highlight its complaints does not appear to offer 
meaningful value to prospective purchasers.  Many complaints would not fall into 
simple categories easily classified into aggregate data fields.  Furthermore, 
categorization of complaints would fail to distinguish the severity and rational of 
complaints.  For example, the proposed rule does not appear to require distinction 
between problems caused purely by airline issues and those that are the result of 
some uncontrollable factor such as the weather.  The ambiguity of complaint 
classification would also lead carriers to adopt disparate standards, which would 
make enforcement problematic.  In addition, many complaints are resolved over a 
period of time, requiring a constant reshuffling of data fields and arbitrary decisions 
whether a specific complaint was resolved.  

Require Carriers to Report On-Time Performance of International Flights

The proposed rule would require foreign carriers to report on-time performance for 
international flights.  

NBTA supports this requirement as a reasonable mechanism to bring greater 
transparency to a growing market of increasing significance to NBTA and its 
international partners.  NBTA encourages DOT, however, to align any new 
reporting requirements as much as possible with current requirements applicable 
to purely domestic flights.  In addition, to the extent such information can be 
communicated via transmissions mechanisms already in place for other purposes, 
such as the Advanced Passenger Information System, the new requirement may 
be implemented in a cost-effective manner.  

Carriers’ Adherence to Customer Service Plans

The proposed rule would require carriers to audit their adherence to their own 
customer service plans.  It also seeks comment whether carriers who do not have 
such plans should be required to adopt one and what might be included and 
whether they should be incorporated in their contract of carriage.  

It is difficult to imagine that self-audits of customer service plans will create 
significant credibility for such plans.  NBTA supports providing the DOT IG with 
resources to conduct audits of carrier customer service, whether they have 
adopted a specific plan or not, to improve public information about airline 
performance.  However, recognizing the cost of compliance, NBTA suggests that 
such audits be conducted no greater than every three years and that they be 
conducted at similar times in the year to provide accurate comparative 
information.  

As mentioned under the issues of contingency plans, NBTA believes that 
customer service is best left to market forces, subject to the baseline passenger 
rights.  

Retroactive Applicability of Amendments to Contracts of Carriage

DOT seeks comments on whether customers on the same flight should be 
subject to the same contract of carriage if changes or amendments occurred 
between passengers’ purchases.

NBTA believes that customers flying on the same flight should be subject to the 
same contract of carriage terms regardless of when their ticket was purchased.  
Often times business travelers schedule their trips at the last minute and should 
not be subjected to different regulations due to the nature of their business.

Such a practice could have potentially detrimental effects to airline customer 
service as well.  Providing customers on various flights with different responses 
and compensation would complicate the process and likely require additional 
staffing in airline customer service departments. 

Effective Date

The proposed rule would require airlines to adopt plans for compliance within 180 
days of the publishing date of the final rule.  It seeks comments on whether that 
gives airlines sufficient time for implementation.  

If implemented, some of the rules would require significant changes to airline 
practices resulting in the need for additional implementation time.  NBTA believes 
a reasonable effective date should be established by DOT after determining the 
impact the final rule will have on air carriers.

Subject:	Comments of FlyersRights.org on NPRM
?Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections?

Reference:	14 CFR Parts 234, 253, 259, and 399
Docket No. DOT-OST-2007-0022
RIN No. 2105-AD72

SUBJECT:	The Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) opposes the subject 
NPRM (Item 1) as an unlawful delegation of DOT authority and responsibility to 
regulate airlines in the public interest by delegating this function the airlines 
themselves.  As written it is an anti-consumer regulation that would take away 
existing common law tort rights of airline passengers for false imprisonment and 
negligence in situations of long confinements on the tarmac of 3-11 hours, that 
airlines now subject approximately 300,000 passengers a year to, and substitute 
an unenforceable contract cause of action.  ACAP supports Items 2-7 of the 
NPRM. 


Dear Secretary LaHood:

	The Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) was founded in 1971 as 
501(c ) 3 nonprofit organization that acts as voice for air travelers on issues of 
safety, security and airline consumer rights and interests.  It has held 
longstanding membership on the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee 
(ARAC) and the Aviation Security Advisory Committee.  We have testified before 
Congress on the issues in this NPRM and filed comments with DOT.  

	I have been executive director of ACAP since 1997 and as an attorney 
have represented ACAP, individual consumers and Flyersrights.org (fka the 
Coalition for an Airline Passengers Bill of Rights) in the federal and state courts on 
the issues addressed in this NRPM.

1.  Putting Contingency Plans in the Contract of Carriage.

	This NPRM (1) is a last gasp Bush Administration/Airline Industry effort 
to turn over DOT regulatory authority to the regulated party.  It would lead to a 
multiplicity of unenforceable ?standards? and ?plans.?  Some airlines already are 
using a 4 to 6 hour guideline for tarmac confinements.  As there is presently no 
federal standard, state common law standards for negligence and false 
imprisonment, state criminal statutes involving unsafe operation of aircraft and 
wrongful imprisonment or reckless endangerment, and possibly constitutional 
protections against unreasonable seizure are the only legal protections airline 
passengers have against indefinite tarmac confinements.  

	Most airlines now have or claim to have contingency plans to deal with 
flight disruptions of more than 2 hours.  But they are vague and commonly ignored 
(e.g. American Airlines has a contingency plan that is supposed to be activated 
after a 2 hours of delay but it was been found by the OIG to have been ignored and 
violated repeatedly in a Sept. 2007 report of its 12/29/06 mass diversion and 
stranding of over 100 flights involving over 10,000 passengers).  Such plans are 
vague and there is nothing in them that a airline passenger can really enforce in a 
contract action.  Such plans placed in the contract of carriage would just be 
another way for airlines to absolve themselves of responsibility for long tarmac 
delays, diversions and confinements.

	These confinements of 3- 11 hours now affect approximately 300,000 
passengers per year and have led to a national outcry and the formation of a 
national grass roots organization, Flyersrights.org with over 24,000 members.  The 
claims of the Air Transport Association that tarmac confinements have declined 
are false or at least unproven.  The DOT BTS only recently began collecting these 
statistics in 2008 and has had to remove the data presented by the airlines 
as ?corrupted? and therefore unreliable.

	The proposed regulation would wipe out existing legal protections and 
in our view would lead to more not less tarmac confinements as each airline would 
be in effect be able to write its own rule.  Such an unlawful delegation of DOT 
regulatory authority  would no doubt be challenged in court.   

	The age of self-regulation and deregulation whether in the financial 
industry, air safety, food safety, or airline consumer protection is over.  It has been 
thoroughly discredited by scandals and disasters over the past two years and 
even rejected by many of its former advocates.  The Obama DOT must reject the 
mantra of former DOT Secretary Peters that the ?market? will solve all consumer 
problems.  Senator and Candidate Obama endorsed airline passenger rights 
legislation that would outlaw tarmac confinements of over 3 hours, which this 
NPRM would clearly not do.  
	
	When an airline passenger brings an action in state court,  the airline 
almost invariably has it removed to federal court on grounds of federal preemption.  
The defendant airline will then file a series of motions to have the case transferred 
to its home state, often far from the consumer passenger?s residence.  The cost of 
such litigation far exceeds the individual claims for ordinary delays or tarmac 
confinements.  The airlines are generally successful in having such lawsuits 
dismissed, discouraged or abandoned.  Indeed a review of cases under CCH 
Aviation cases shows that virtually the only breach of contract cases brought 
under the contracts of carriage successfully involve cargo shipments by 
commercial shippers.   You can view the many technical defenses Recent cases 
involving passenger strandings which include  Ray v American Airlines, Inc. US 
DC WD AR 08-5072, Hanni v American Airlines, Inc. US DC ND CA 08-732; 
Harper v American Airlines, Inc. US DC ND AL 08-________ (filed 12/29/08); 
Biscone v JetBlue Airways Corp., NYS SC Queens Co. 3776/2008.  The motions 
to dismiss or transfer or for summary judgment filed by the airline defendants can 
be viewed online at Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) or the 
electronic dockets of the New York State Uniform Court System web site.

	Under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) (perhaps better 
described as the Consumer Class Action Elimination Act of 2005), nearly all state 
consumer class actions (which involves any case with a potential total claim over 
$5 Million) are removed to federal court where the bar is so high for certification 
that very few consumer class actions have ever been certified since this statute 
went into effect.  In the 5th Circuit which is the home of American, Southwest and 
Continental Airlines, none have been certified.  

	As to the issue of tarmac confinements, only one 1999 case against 
Northwest Airlines has been certified as a class action to our knowledge, and that 
occurred in Michigan state court involving confinements of up to 9 hours of 4,000 
passengers prior to the enactment of CAFA. Only through class actions in federal 
court or in local small claims court is it possible for airline passengers to judicially 
enforce breach of contract to tort claims that do not involve serious physical injury 
or death.  And since a class action requires that many passengers be involved 
with common facts and law, only mass stranding events would normally qualify.

	Some airlines already provide for compensation for delays and 
associated expenses of overnight lodging in their contracts of carriage, but these 
provisions are not as a practical matter enforceable and are frequently ignored or 
avoided entirely by airlines coding nearly every delayed or canceled flight as 
weather or FAA Air Traffic Control related.  There is no effective oversight by DOT 
and no fines of substance for airline violation of their own contracts or customer 
service plans or contingency plans or internal policies, and none seems likely in 
the foreseeable future.

	The NPRM if adopted would mean domestic US airline passengers 
would have rights inferior to those provided to international passengers under the 
Montreal Convention of 1999.  Under Art. 19, passengers may recover damages 
for delay of up to  about $6,400 on a near strict liability basis.  An airline to avoid 
liability has the burden of proving that it took all reasonable steps to avoid the 
delay or that the delay was impossible to avoid.  Damages include compensation 
for inconvenience as well as out of pocket losses and this treaty overrides the 
limitations or exclusions commonly found in domestic airline contracts of carriage, 
which make promises in those contracts largely illusory.  

	Should NPRM (Item 1) be adopted in any form, it should include 
provisions in domestic contracts of carriage a) requiring payment of litigation 
expenses of the passenger should s/he substantially prevail in the lawsuit, b) be 
no less favorable to domestic passengers than international passengers, c) should 
specifically authorize suits in state as well as federal courts, d) authorize class 
actions where appropriate, with the consumer class representative receiving a 
reasonable sum in compensation his time and representational responsibilities of 
the class, payment of class notification expenses by the airline defendant, plus 
treble damages or minimum compensation of  four times the ticket price, and e) 
have a hard 3 hour passenger right to deplane plus delay compensation of $10 per 
minute for on ground confinements over 3 hours. 

	Only with such pro-consumer provisions will airlines have an incentive 
to change their existing practices of ignoring passenger complaints and claims 
with impunity or offering only token compensation such as discount coupons or 
restricted vouchers.


	Items 2-7.  ACAP has long advocated for Truth in Scheduling regulation 
as a first line of defense against congestion delays caused by over scheduling by 
airlines.  These proposed measures are in line with our recommendations and 
would address the No. 1 airline passenger complaint:  flight delays.   As 
scheduling has been decontrolled airlines now have incentives to unrealistically 
schedule flights at popular times for competitive reasons, which in turn leads to 
unnecessary congestion at major choke point airports like NYC and Chicago.  
These regulations should allow consumers to avoid chronically delayed flights, 
should eliminate deceptively scheduled flights, and help relieve congestion delays 
at choke point airports.
 
	We generally support the comments of Flyersrights.org .

important that the Department consider ACI-NA’s comments because an airline’s 
failure to provide on-time performance has a significant impact on airport 
operations and facilities.  The effect of chronically delayed flights is even more 
severe as passengers often lose confidence in the operations at the airport, which 
could result in booking future flights at another airport or the use of an alternative 
mode of transportation, if possible. This impacts the finances of the airport and the 
economy of the local community. 

The impact at smaller airports is even more pronounced. The Department should 
keep in mind that delayed flights at the smaller (feeder) airports have a greater 
adverse effect on the ability to make connections at the hubs and are more 
disruptive to passengers.

Subject:	Comments of Aviation Consumer Action Project on NPRM
“Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections”

Reference:	14 CFR Parts 234, 253, 259, and 399
Docket No. DOT-OST-2007-0022
RIN No. 2105-AD72

SUBJECT:	The Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) opposes the subject 
NPRM (Item 1) as an unlawful delegation of DOT authority and responsibility to 
regulate airlines in the public interest by delegating this function the airlines 
themselves.  As written it is an anti-consumer regulation that would take away 
existing common law tort rights of airline passengers for false imprisonment and 
negligence in situations of long confinements on the tarmac of 3-11 hours, that 
airlines now subject approximately 300,000 passengers a year to, and substitute 
an unenforceable contract cause of action.  ACAP supports Items 2-7 of the 
NPRM. 


Dear Secretary LaHood:

	The Aviation Consumer Action Project (ACAP) was founded in 1971 as 
501(c ) 3 nonprofit organization that acts as voice for air travelers on issues of 
safety, security and airline consumer rights and interests.  It has held 
longstanding membership on the FAA Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee 
(ARAC) and the Aviation Security Advisory Committee.  We have testified before 
Congress on the issues in this NPRM and filed comments with DOT.  

	I have been executive director of ACAP since 1997 and as an attorney 
have represented ACAP, individual consumers and Flyersrights.org (fka the 
Coalition for an Airline Passengers Bill of Rights) in the federal and state courts on 
the issues addressed in this NRPM.

1.  Putting Contingency Plans in the Contract of Carriage.

	This NPRM (1) is a last gasp Bush Administration/Airline Industry effort 
to turn over DOT regulatory authority to the regulated party.  It would lead to a 
multiplicity of unenforceable “standards” and “plans.”  Some airlines already are 
using a 4 to 6 hour guideline for tarmac confinements.  As there is presently no 
federal standard, state common law standards for negligence and false 
imprisonment, state criminal statutes involving unsafe operation of aircraft and 
wrongful imprisonment or reckless endangerment, and possibly constitutional 
protections against unreasonable seizure are the only legal protections airline 
passengers have against indefinite tarmac confinements.  

	Most airlines now have or claim to have contingency plans to deal with 
flight disruptions of more than 2 hours.  But they are vague and commonly ignored 
(e.g. American Airlines has a contingency plan that is supposed to be activated 
after a 2 hours of delay but it was been found by the OIG to have been ignored and 
violated repeatedly in a Sept. 2007 report of its 12/29/06 mass diversion and 
stranding of over 100 flights involving over 10,000 passengers).  Such plans are 
vague and there is nothing in them that a airline passenger can really enforce in a 
contract action.  Such plans placed in the contract of carriage would just be 
another way for airlines to absolve themselves of responsibility for long tarmac 
delays, diversions and confinements.

	These confinements of 3- 11 hours now affect approximately 300,000 
passengers per year and have led to a national outcry and the formation of a 
national grass roots organization, Flyersrights.org with over 24,000 members.  The 
claims of the Air Transport Association that tarmac confinements have declined 
are false or at least unproven.  The DOT BTS only recently began collecting these 
statistics in 2008 and has had to remove the data presented by the airlines 
as “corrupted” and therefore unreliable.

	The proposed regulation would wipe out existing legal protections and 
in our view would lead to more not less tarmac confinements as each airline would 
be in effect be able to write its own rule.  Such an unlawful delegation of DOT 
regulatory authority  would no doubt be challenged in court.   

	The age of self-regulation and deregulation whether in the financial 
industry, air safety, food safety, or airline consumer protection is over.  It has been 
thoroughly discredited by scandals and disasters over the past two years and 
even rejected by many of its former advocates.  The Obama DOT must reject the 
mantra of former DOT Secretary Peters that the “market” will solve all consumer 
problems.  Senator and Candidate Obama endorsed airline passenger rights 
legislation that would outlaw tarmac confinements of over 3 hours, which this 
NPRM would clearly not do.  
	
	When an airline passenger brings an action in state court,  the airline 
almost invariably has it removed to federal court on grounds of federal preemption.  
The defendant airline will then file a series of motions to have the case transferred 
to its home state, often far from the consumer passenger’s residence.  The cost of 
such litigation far exceeds the individual claims for ordinary delays or tarmac 
confinements.  The airlines are generally successful in having such lawsuits 
dismissed, discouraged or abandoned.  Indeed a review of cases under CCH 
Aviation cases shows that virtually the only breach of contract cases brought 
under the contracts of carriage successfully involve cargo shipments by 
commercial shippers.   You can view the many technical defenses Recent cases 
involving passenger strandings which include  Ray v American Airlines, Inc. US 
DC WD AR 08-5072, Hanni v American Airlines, Inc. US DC ND CA 08-732; 
Harper v American Airlines, Inc. US DC ND AL 08-________ (filed 12/29/08); 
Biscone v JetBlue Airways Corp., NYS SC Queens Co. 3776/2008.  The motions 
to dismiss or transfer or for summary judgment filed by the airline defendants can 
be viewed online at Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) or the 
electronic dockets of the New York State Uniform Court System web site.

	Under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) (perhaps better 
described as the Consumer Class Action Elimination Act of 2005), nearly all state 
consumer class actions (which involves any case with a potential total claim over 
$5 Million) are removed to federal court where the bar is so high for certification 
that very few consumer class actions have ever been certified since this statute 
went into effect.  In the 5th Circuit which is the home of American, Southwest and 
Continental Airlines, none have been certified.  

	As to the issue of tarmac confinements, only one 1999 case against 
Northwest Airlines has been certified as a class action to our knowledge, and that 
occurred in Michigan state court involving confinements of up to 9 hours of 4,000 
passengers prior to the enactment of CAFA. Only through class actions in federal 
court or in local small claims court is it possible for airline passengers to judicially 
enforce breach of contract to tort claims that do not involve serious physical injury 
or death.  And since a class action requires that many passengers be involved 
with common facts and law, only mass stranding events would normally qualify.

	Some airlines already provide for compensation for delays and 
associated expenses of overnight lodging in their contracts of carriage, but these 
provisions are not as a practical matter enforceable and are frequently ignored or 
avoided entirely by airlines coding nearly every delayed or canceled flight as 
weather or FAA Air Traffic Control related.  There is no effective oversight by DOT 
and no fines of substance for airline violation of their own contracts or customer 
service plans or contingency plans or internal policies, and none seems likely in 
the foreseeable future.

	The NPRM if adopted would mean domestic US airline passengers 
would have rights inferior to those provided to international passengers under the 
Montreal Convention of 1999.  Under Art. 19, passengers may recover damages 
for delay of up to  about $6,400 on a near strict liability basis.  An airline to avoid 
liability has the burden of proving that it took all reasonable steps to avoid the 
delay or that the delay was impossible to avoid.  Damages include compensation 
for inconvenience as well as out of pocket losses and this treaty overrides the 
limitations or exclusions commonly found in domestic airline contracts of carriage, 
which make promises in those contracts largely illusory.  

	Should NPRM (Item 1) be adopted in any form, it should include 
provisions in domestic contracts of carriage a) requiring payment of litigation 
expenses of the passenger should s/he substantially prevail in the lawsuit, b) be 
no less favorable to domestic passengers than international passengers, c) should 
specifically authorize suits in state as well as federal courts, d) authorize class 
actions where appropriate, with the consumer class representative receiving a 
reasonable sum in compensation his time and representational responsibilities of 
the class, payment of class notification expenses by the airline defendant, plus 
treble damages or minimum compensation of  four times the ticket price, and e) 
have a hard 3 hour passenger right to deplane plus delay compensation of $10 per 
minute for on ground confinements over 3 hours. 

	Only with such pro-consumer provisions will airlines have an incentive 
to change their existing practices of ignoring passenger complaints and claims 
with impunity or offering only token compensation such as discount coupons or 
restricted vouchers.


	Items 2-7.  ACAP has long advocated for Truth in Scheduling regulation 
as a first line of defense against congestion delays caused by over scheduling by 
airlines.  These proposed measures are in line with our recommendations and 
would address the No. 1 airline passenger complaint:  flight delays.   As 
scheduling has been decontrolled airlines now have incentives to unrealistically 
schedule flights at popular times for competitive reasons, which in turn leads to 
unnecessary congestion at major choke point airports like NYC and Chicago.  
These regulations should allow consumers to avoid chronically delayed flights, 
should eliminate deceptively scheduled flights, and help relieve congestion delays 
at choke point airports.

		Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections

Reference:	14 CFR Parts 234, 253, 259, and 399
Docket No. DOT-OST-2007-0022
RIN No. 2105-AD72

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We the undersigned national organizations together representing hundreds of
millions of consumers in the United States wish to have our views considered on
the proposed regulation under consideration by the U.S. Department of
Transportation on “Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections.”

In general, our organizations support DOT’s taking an activist role in issuing
regulations that protect airline passengers during long tarmac delays, that
assure that air travelers will receive timely and accurate information from
airlines when there are flight delays, and that provide for the effective
enforceability of DOT requirements directly by passengers in state courts on
understandable provisions in airline Contracts of Carriage, along with an
activist DOT enforcement program.  Thus we support the proposals in the NPRM but
believe they should be strengthened.

Specifically, we are opposed to the DOT concept that would turn Federal
regulatory authority over to individual airlines -- who would each decide how
much protection to offer airline passengers stuck on airline aircraft at
airports for many hours.  In lieu of setting minimum Federal standards for
airlines to provide water, food, working restrooms, comfortable cabin
temperatures and an option to deplane when it is safe to do so, DOT is proposing
to let each U.S. airline set its own guidelines without any Federal review and
approval.

One of the criteria states ""that if the control tower deems the return of a plane to be disruptive to normal airport operations, then that individual in the control tower can deny the plane a return to a gate."" To the average traveler, we would never be informed of the real reason why the long delay, but the wording on this opens up a whole new set of issues, including the opportunity for collusion between the airlines and the control tower staff, where this excuse can be used on a regular basis and we the people, have nothing to say about it unless one goes into a very deep (and expensive) investigation as to why the control tower made this call. It's not tight enough, so it needs to be revisited again and reworded, in my opinion, so as to offer more transparency as opposed to ""the decision was made and cannot be changed"" method of operations. Too often we, the paying public, are herded into an area where we are simply told that this is the way it is and if you do not agree, you can write your state representative or Congressman (or woman) and voice your opinion. But, we all know that this usually doesn't too far and most of us do not have enough time at our disposal to chase this down. let's protect the high airfare-paying public from the very beginning and making this legislation a lot tighter, so there are no misunderstandings or surprises and that we are all working off the same sheet of music, please.

RE: Docket DOT-OST 2008-0252

Dear Madam Secretary:

Having been furloughed from American Airlines nearly six years and facing the 
potential of having my rights to return to work expire, I am urging you to seek job 
assurances from American Airlines when considering their application for anti-trust 
immunity with its   partner British Airways.

While other carriers have received anti-trust immunity, this one is unique.   
American Airlines still has thousands of workers on lay off as a result of its DOT 
approved merger with TWA and the events of 9/11.

These workers deserve to have consideration and assurances they will remain on 
the recall list, in exchange for any immunity granted by the Department of 
Transportation.

I urge you to ensure that any agreements reached include provisions and oversight 
to protect the interest of these workers in this time of economic uncertainty.

coordinate air service is mired in the mud at the DOT. The DOT granted other 
major U.S. carriers immunity years ago, but continues to subjugate American to 
financial discrimination. You need to be helping the U.S. traveler move around the 
globe seamlessly by allowing ALL U.S. carriers to compete. This smacks of 
politics and favoritism. You do not help me, the traveler, by putting restrictions on 
a deregulated market. British Airways is not buying control of American so why is 
the DOT trying to restrict our options. Not approving the merger does nothing to 
change the status quo in London’s Heathrow airport while approving it might 
actually open some slots that could be had by others. Air service is expensive for 
a multitude of reasons. One of those reasons should not be the onerous 
application of government bureaucracy.

Dear Madam Secretary:

Having been furloughed from American Airlines nearly six years and facing the 
potential of having my rights to return to work expire, I am urging you to seek job 
assurances from American Airlines when considering their application for anti-trust 
immunity with their partner British Airways.

While other carriers have received anti-trust immunity, this one is unique.   
American Airlines still has thousands of workers on lay off as a result of its DOT- 
approved merger with TWA and the events of 9/11.

These workers deserve to have consideration and assurances they will remain on 
the recall list, in exchange for any immunity granted by the Department of 
Transportation.

I urge you to ensure that any agreements reached include provisions and oversight 
to protect the interest of these workers in this time of economic uncertainty.

I have been a flight attendant for almost 40 years.  When AA purchased TWA, the 
company and the union placed us on the bottom of the seniority list.  As a 
consequence, I was laid off for 4 years while others with 1 year seniority were still 
flying.  This in itself is a travesty and should be addressed.  However, the union and 
company are negotiating and implementing ways to increase furloughs and prevent the 
thousands who are still awaiting recall to fall off the list.
If it is not possible for the government to step in and give the TWA flight attendants their 
rightful seniority, please at least extend the recall rights for those of us on the street and 
those of us who may be soon.  By the way, we are all over 40 years old and many are 
in our 50's and 60's. 
There should be unlimited recall rights.  We lost most of our retirement with Carl Ichan 
and need this job.

RE: Docket DOT-OST 2008-0252

Dear Madam Secretary:

Having been furloughed from American Airlines nearly six years and facing the 
potential of having my rights to return to work expire, I am urging you to seek job 
assurances from American Airlines when considering their application for anti-trust 
immunity with its   partner British Airways.

While other carriers have received anti-trust immunity, this one is unique.   
American Airlines still has thousands of workers on lay off as a result of its DOT 
approved merger with TWA and the events of 9/11.

These workers deserve to have consideration and assurances they will remain on 
the recall list, in exchange for any immunity granted by the Department of 
Transportation.

I urge you to ensure that any agreements reached include provisions and oversight 
to protect the interest of these workers in this time of economic uncertainty.

RE: Docket DOT-OST 2008-0252

Dear Madam Secretary:

As one of thousands of furloughed American Airlines flight attendants still layed off 
for nearly six years since 9-11, hear our plea.  We are fast approaching the time 
where our rights to return to work expire. I am asking you to seek job assurances 
from American Airlines when considering their application for anti-trust immunity 
with its partner British Airways.

While other carriers have received anti-trust immunity, this one is unique.   
American Airlines still has thousands of workers on lay off as a result of its DOT 
approved merger with TWA and the events of 9/11. 

Senator Claire McCaskill is very familiar with the unfortunate circumstances of  
these former TWA workers with airline careers crippled by 9-11 and the actions of 
American Airlines, and its flight attendant union. Many with over 20 years of 
experience, still desire the chance to finish their careers and regain the ability to 
retire with pensions and benefits they worked hard for.

These workers deserve to have consideration and assurances they will remain on 
the recall list, in exchange for any immunity granted by the Department of 
Transportation.

I urge you to ensure that any agreements reached include provisions and oversight 
to protect the interest of these workers in this time of economic uncertainty. 

Sincerely,
Carol L. Harvey

Dear Mr. Secretary:

Having been furloughed from American Airlines nearly six years and facing the 
potential of having my rights to return to work expire, I am urging you to seek job 
assurances from American Airlines when considering their application for anti-trust 
immunity with its partner British Airways.

While other carriers have received anti-trust immunity, this one is unique. 
American Airlines still has thousands of workers on lay off as a result of its DOT & 
DOJ approved merger with TWA and the events of 9/11.

These workers deserve to have consideration and assurances they will remain on 
the recall list, in exchange for any immunity granted by the Department of 
Transportation.

I urge you to ensure that any agreements reached include provisions and oversight 
to protect the interest of these workers in this time of economic uncertainty.

Please HELP.  The 2 year extension that wonderful Claire McCaskill gained for us 
TWA'ers is going to expire in approximately one year.  We have a website that 
keeps us going, that gives us hope, that keeps us united.  It is on myfamily.com.  
We have had it since we were furloughed.  We are ladies and gentleman in our 
30,s 40's and 50's still missing our airline career which we offered our 
professionalism and loyalty to for many years.  As you know, the ""fair and 
equitable"" treatment by American Airlines (quote:  ""Two great airlines, one great 
company"") --- except they stapled us to the bottom - below 20 year olds that had 
2 years with the company (I had 20 plus) when furloughed.  I miss my job and 
have grieved for it.  I was layed off shortly before my husband was diagnosed with 
terminal cancer.  Not only was my cherished career taken from me - also Bob, my 
husband.  I can't get him back, but I want my job at American Airlines back.  
Please HELP.

Mr. Secretary:

I am an American Airlines flight attendant on furlough. I was furloughted by AA in 
November 2002 after their acquisition of TWA where I had 15 years seniority.  
American Airlines still has thousands of workers on lay off as a result of its DOT & 
DOJ approved merger with TWA and the events of 9/11. This merger effectively 
wiped-out decades of hard-earned seniority for all TWA employees. 

I am urging you to seek job assurances from American Airlines when considering 
their application for anti-trust immunity with its partner British Airways. My recall 
rights will expire in Nov. 2009, and will have lost the 16 years I have invested in my 
airline career and retirement benefits. American Airlines will go on to hire 
inexperienced cheaper workforce and thus cheat former workers of their 
livelihoods, careers and their retirements.

Dear Mr. Secretary,

I am one of the very unfortunate TWA flight attendants who was furloughed from 
American Airlines more than six years ago.  I continue to face the potential of 
having my rights to return to work expire, even though I HAD NEARLY 17 YEARS 
EXPERIENCE.  Therefore, I am urging you to seek job assurances from American 
Airlines when considering their application for anti-trust immunity with its partner 
British Airways.

While other carriers have received anti-trust immunity, THIS ONE IS UNIQUE. 
American Airlines still has thousands of workers on furlough as a result of its DOT 
& DOJ approved merger with TWA and the events of 9/11.

I and ALL OF MY COWORKERS DESERVE to have CONSIDERATION and 
ASSURANCES that we will remain on the recall list, IN EXCHANGE FOR any 
IMMUNITY granted by the Department of Transportation.

I URGE YOU to ensure that any agreements reached include provisions and 
oversight  TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS of me and my coworkers in this time of 
economic uncertainty.

RE: Docket DOT-OST 2008-0252

Dear Mr. Secretary,

I am asking that before this anti-trust immunity is even entertained by our 
government, that you review the very real possibility of even more job losses within 
the US airline industry. We have suffered unprecedented layoffs since 9/11 and 
any agreements with foreign countries and U.S. companies should be certain to 
include protections with regard to U.S. workers. 

American Airlines already employs hundreds of foreign nationals, even though 
there are over a thousand U.S. citizens currently furloughed at American that 
could use those jobs and contribute to our country's tax base. We must have job 
security assurances from American Airlines before they are permitted to enter into 
any agreements with foreign countries or carriers.

I am a former TWA flight attendant with 30 years of experience who has been laid 
off twice since 9/11. Of approximately 4,000 former TWA flight attendants at the 
time of American Airline's acquisition (which was sanctioned by our own 
government), there are presently only 250 who are actively flying . 1,261 are 
currently furloughed. Most of my fellow furloughees have worked 25 years or more 
in the airline industry and deserve to have consideration and assurances that they 
will remain employed and/or on the recall list if this anti-trust immunity is granted.

Our country is already faced with many thousands who are unemployed. I urge 
you to ensure that any agreements reached will include provisions and oversight 
to protect the interest of the American Airlines employees, including those waiting 
to be recalled to their jobs.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Yvonne Perano

provider of commuter vanpools, wishes to comment DOT staff for the proposed 
rulemaking to implement the eligibility changes to TIFIA required by SAFTETEA-
LU.

VPSI requests clarification regarding the eligibility changes outlined in Section 
80.7.  Pursuant to the authorizing sections of SAFTETEA-LU, the NPR indicates 
that eligible projects must be contained within an approved STIP at the time the 
credit instrument with DOT is entered into.  What the NPR does not cover is 
situations where the project may not be required to be contained within a STIP.  
The question of staff is whether they plan to cover such a situation within their final 
rule.

One scenario that could cover this situation is a request of capital assistance from 
a private provider of public transportation that provides an interstate service.  Given 
that the service covers multiple states, and the capital provision is coming from a 
private provider, this type of situation may not be contained within a STIP.  Does 
DOT plan on covering this scenario in the final rule?

A second scenario that might apply to this situation is a request of capital 
assistance from a private provider of public transportation where operations in any 
one particular state may not meet eligibility thresholds, but that their collective 
operations may meet those thresholds but for the STIP requirement.  Does DOT 
plan on addressing projects of national scope that do not fit within current planning 
requirements under the final rule?",,,,,,,

have delayed the recipients for the workload to submit the DBE rule in the departments of 
transportation, transit authorities and airports; however, a higher quality of internal administration 
organization of the task to submit goals and adjusting new opportunities in the work force should

opportunities annually will benefit all in the List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 26, which are in 
general administrative practices, government contracts and the transportation sector.

According to 49 CFR Part 26, Subpart A, Section 26.1, two of the main objectives of 
the DBE Program are:
¨	To create a level playing field on which DBEs can compete fairly for DOT-
assisted contracts
¨	To ensure that the Department’s DBE Program is narrowly tailored in 
accordance with applicable law.
By going to an every three-year overall goal submission for Part 26 recipients, we 
would be failing to achieve these two objectives which are based on the Supreme Court 
decision regarding Adarand Constructors v. Pena as well as failing to meet DOT 
standards for the DBE Program.  

To substantiate my reasoning I submit the following information from the DOT OSDBU 
website, specifically from web address: 
http://osdbu.dot.gov/DBEProgram/sectionbysection.cfm:

“Q. Section 26.45 How Do Recipients Set Overall Goals? 

A.Since its inception, the recipient's overall goal has been the heart of the DBE 
program. Responding to Adarand, DOT clarified the theory and purpose of the overall 
goal in the SNPRM. In the proposed rule, the Department made clear that the purpose 
of the overall goal-- and, in fact, the DBE program as a whole--is to achieve a ``level 
playing field'' for DBEs seeking to participate in federal-aid transportation contracting. 
To reach a level playing field, recipients need to examine their programs and their 
markets and determine the amount of participation they would expect DBEs to achieve 
in the absence of discrimination and the effects of past discrimination. The focus of the 
goal section of the SNPRM was to propose ways to measure what a level playing field 
would look like and to seek input on the availability of data to make such a 
measurement.”

Under “The Proposed Rules and Comments,” please refer to paragraph 8:
“In view of the complexity and importance of the goal setting process and the many 
issues raised by commenters, the Department has decided to adopt a two step process 
for goal setting. The process is intended to provide the maximum flexibility for 
recipients while ensuring that goals are based on the availability of ready, willing and 
able DBEs in each recipient's relevant market. The Department believes that this 
approach is critical to meeting our constitutional obligation to ensure that the program 
is narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of discrimination. The first step of the 
process will be to create a baseline figure for the relative availability of ready, willing 
and able DBEs in each recipient's market. The second step will be to make adjustments 
from the base figure, relying on an examination of additional evidence, past 
experience, local expertise and anticipated changes in DOT-assisted contracting over 
the coming year.”

Under, “Step 1: Determining a Base Figure for the Overall Goal, “ please refer to 
paragraphs 1, 2, 3 & 15:
Paragraph 1: “The base figure is intended to be a measurement of the current 
percentage of ready, willing and able businesses that are DBEs. Ensuring that this 
figure is based on demonstrable evidence of each recipient's relevant market 
conditions will help to ensure that the program remains narrowly tailored. To be explicit, 
recipients cannot simply use the 10 percent national goal, their goal from the previous 
year, or their DBE participation level from the previous year as their base figure. 
Instead, all recipients must take an actual measurement of their marketplace, using the 
best evidence they have available, and derive a base figure that is as fair and accurate 
a representation as possible of the percentage of available businesses that are DBEs.”

Paragraph 2: “…In this final rule, the Department is placing primary emphasis on the 
principles underlying the measurement, mandating only that a measurement of the 
relative availability of DBEs be made on the basis of demonstrable evidence of relevant 
market conditions, rather than requiring that any particular procedure or formula be 
used…”

Paragraph 3: ”… By fixing only the basic principle, but allowing the methodology to 
change, recipients will have the opportunity to fine tune the process each year as their 
experience grows and the data available to them improve. Finally, the rule makes sure 
that every recipient will have at least one reasonable and practical goal setting method 
available to them.”

Paragraph 15: ”… the methodology must be based on demonstrable data of relevant 
market conditions and be designed to reach a goal that the recipient would expect 
DBEs to achieve in the absence of discrimination.”

Under “Additional Goal Setting Issues,” please refer to paragraph 1:
Paragraph 1: “The Department proposed, in both the 1992 NPRM and the 1997 
SNPRM, that overall goals be calculated as a percentage of DOT funds a recipient 
expects to expend in DOT-assisted contracts…”

By going to an every three-year overall goal submission for Part 26 recipients, we 
would be failing to achieve the originally stated two objectives and the published 
directives.  

AIP (Airport Improvement Program) projects vary significantly from year to year in 
regard to construction work items as well as dollars available for projects.  For example, 
one year you might be determining the DBE goal for a $1.0 million asphalt overlay 
project and the next year a $2.1 million lighting project.  NAICS (North American 
Industry Classification System) codes for these two projects vary greatly and 
significantly affect goal determination.  For clarification, NAICS codes are used to 
determine the work items for the AIP project and from this list we derive the DBEs 
potentially available to perform the work.

As referenced in “Tips for Goal-Setting in the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise 
(DBE) Program,” located on FAA Office of Civil Rights website as well as the DOT 
OSDBU website: “STEP ONE:  The most important thing to remember about step one 
of the goal setting process is that you are attempting to come up with a measurement 
of the actual relative availability of DBEs to perform the types of contracts (both prime 
and sub) that you intend to let.”  The types of projects and the availability of ready, 
willing and able DBEs will most definitely vary from year to year.  Therefore an every 
three-year goal submission does not “level the playing field” and does not ensure 
a “narrowly tailored” program.

Regarding “whether to provide for annual reviews of goals or adjustments for new 
opportunities,” for AIP projects that change from year to year, this is a must.  An 
annual review ultimately defeats the purpose of the every three-year goal submission 
because a review requires proceeding through the entire goal-setting process and 
results in the new submittal of an overall goal.  In a nutshell, the same amount of work is 
required for an annual review or an overall goal submission in order to “level the 
playing field” and to “narrowly tailor” the program.  An annual review ultimately is a 
NEW OVERALL GOAL SUBMISSION.

The every three-year goal submission, probably works well for ACDBE 49 CFR Part 23 
where NAICS codes are generally the same from year to year.  However for 49 CFR 
Part 26 where the NAICS codes change significantly from year to year, the every 
three-year goal submission would not work well and ultimately defeats the purpose of 
the two main objectives of the DBE Program as well as the directives issued on the 
OSDBU website.

be a three-year goal which would allow the recipients to better manage their

49 CFR Part 26

Docket No. OST-2009-0081

The Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) welcomes the opportunity to 
comment on the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) notice of 
proposed rulemaking (NPRM), which proposes to revise 49 CFR Part 26.45(f)(1).  
MDOT has three modal administrations that are subject to the annual goal-setting 
process for the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program – the 
Maryland Aviation Administration, the Maryland Transit Administration and 
Maryland’s State Highway Administration.      

MDOT agrees that the current “process of setting annual overall goals can be time-
consuming.”  (Quoting NPRM, 74 Fed. Reg. 15910 (Apr. 8, 2009).)  USDOT’s 
proposal to establish a staggered three-year schedule for submission of DBE 
goals should help MDOT and USDOT better manage their respective workloads.  
MDOT, therefore, supports the provisions for submitting DBE goals every three 
years as well as the proposal to stagger the submission schedules so that the 52 
jurisdictions do not have the same triennial deadline.  MDOT also supports 
changes to Part 26 to allow USDOT operating administrations to grant program 
waivers for different schedules that recipients such as MDOT suggest.  MDOT 
further supports provisions for annual reviews of goals or adjustments for new 
opportunities, along the lines of section 23.45.

This comment was prepared by the MDOT Office of Minority Business Enterprise 
(MBE), the designated DBE/MBE certification office for the State of Maryland, 
7201 Corporate Center Drive, Hanover MD 21076, 410-865-1269.  The point of 
contact is Mr. Micah Watson at 410-865-1258 or mwatson@mdot.state.md.us.

In response to USDOT Docket Numbers OST-2009-0081 and OST-2009-0082 
issued April 8, 2009, Diversity Matters 2 US, LLC (“DM2US”), an independent 
consulting firm specializing in DBE participation and Buy America compliance, 
respectfully submits the following comments:

DM2US would be honored to participate in the stakeholder meetings that bring 
together prime contractors, DBEs and state and local government representatives 
to discuss ways of improving administration of the DBE program. During my 15-
year career, I have managed more than $200 million in subcontract awards and 
payments to DBE, MBE and WBE subcontractors and provided DBE and Buy 
America training to more than 400 employees worldwide. 

The comments stated below may contain excerpts from the author’s previous 
written statements to USDOT, FTA, FTA recipients, APTA, and/or other transit-
related and/or supplier diversity-focused organizations.  


Docket Number OST-2009-0081
How recipients set overall goals

Although the actual results of my past TVM annual goal-setting projections (i.e., 
each FY’s actual DBE goal attainment) were relatively accurate, it was an 
extremely challenging and time-consuming responsibility to “guesstimate” 
specifically when all subcontracts (not just DBE’s) would be awarded because 
production/delivery schedules changed so frequently.  The DOT might consider 
giving recipients the choice between an annual DBE goal and a 2 year fiscal 
period with the option of revising their goal after the first year. 

A significant percentage of government officials are elected during even-numbered 
years (e.g., 2006, 2008, etc.) and subsequently begin their term the following 
January of an odd-numbered year (e.g., 2007, 2009, etc.).  These newly (re-)
elected government officials may inherit existing transportation multiple-year 
budgets/projects/proposals and/or develop new ones based upon needs, funding 
and their personal views toward public transportation.  This ever-changing political 
landscape makes it difficult for recipients to accurately estimate a DBE goal 
beyond one year.

A far more important issue is how goals are set. Although recipients may be 
required to publish their annual DBE percentage goals (perhaps broken down by 
race-conscious and race-neutral amounts), I’ve yet to see any that define how 
they established their percentage.  These DBE goal public notices often state that 
their methodology is available for inspection (only) on-site for (only) 30 days.  
Recipients should be required to post their DBE goal-setting methodologies on 
their website so that bidders/proposers (both DBE and non-DBE) can see for 
themselves which workscopes were/are identified for “ready, willing, and able” 
DBEs.  It’s not well understood at the prime and subcontractor level why this 
information is so difficult to access, especially since public (i.e., taxpayer) funds 
are involved.  Some speculate that, with some recipients, politics may affect DBE 
goal percentages more than available workscopes and therefore expanded public 
access could reveal unsubstantiated goal-setting methodologies.

Establishing an overall fiscal DBE goal, regardless of the time period, is similar to 
projecting sales/income and awards/subcontracts in any organization – it’s based 
upon the larger actual known contracts awarded and pending awards (e.g., 
Notices to Proceed). Some contracts are simply more conducive to DBE 
participation than others.  The DBE goal for any specific time period should 
depend upon various factors such as the type of work involved, the location of the 
work, and the availability of qualified ready, willing and able DBEs. 

Within the passenger railcar industry, some bids are for the remanufacturing 
(refurbishment) of existing vehicles. Since recipients’ DBE goal-setting guidelines 
are neither restricted nor perhaps monitored by the FTA on remanufacturing bids, 
recipients sometimes set DBE goal percentages that, in some cases, are 
technically and/or commercially unattainable. Some recipients set the same 
percentage DBE goal on every eligible bid based upon the anticipated total 
contract value, regardless of available workscopes for ready, willing, and able 
DBEs.  

Some recipients actually do compare NAICS codes and their corresponding 
workscopes to the items needed to build their railcars when establishing DBE 
goals.  However, NAICS codes do not necessarily mean any or all DBEs within a 
certain NAICS code actually possess the capability to perform on a railcar 
contract. For example, there are several DBE truckers and transportation 
suppliers located throughout the country. Included in this list are dump trucks, 
gravel haulers, and food delivery vehicles. However, there are very few, if any, 
DBEs capable of transporting 85-foot carshells or over-dimensional components 
(e.g., locomotive truck assemblies containing traction motors, wheels, and axles). 
The most practical way for a recipient to accurately measure the number of 
capable DBE firms within certain NAICS codes on a railcar contract bid is to 
closely examine the bid specification and determine who is technically qualified to 
perform the work.

Currently, some recipients’ DBE directors do not discuss with their own 
procurement departments what DBE goals they believe are attainable prior to their 
bid specification’s release. It’s time to re-build and strengthen this very important 
relationship.  Recipients need to bring together their engineering, procurement, 
new bids, contract management and DBE departments in order to agree on what 
is a reasonable, attainable DBE goal for each specific contract. Anticipated prime 
bidders and experienced, eligible DBEs could also be involved in the goal setting 
process.  Once a sensible DBE goal is established, prime bidders should make a 
commitment to meet and exceed that goal.
 
Docket Number OST-2009-0082
DBE Program; Potential Program Improvements


Counting of DBE credit for items obtained by DBE contractors from other sources, 
particularly the prime contractor for whom they are working on for a particular 
contract.

Option 1 should remain unchanged to help insure the spirit and intent of the DBE 
program.  Unfortunately, too many individual decision-makers on the prime 
contractor/subcontractor side do not understand the value of supplier diversity.  
Some of these individuals view DBE participation as a recipient- and/or FTA-
mandated cost-driver and will do nearly anything to inflate their DBE “numbers” 
while reducing their DBEs’ actual workscopes.

I strongly agree with the USDOT’s response to Ohio DOT that “doing so (i.e., 
counting the prime contractor’s materials issued to the DBE subcontractor) would 
have the effect of permitting prime contractors to meet the DBE goals while 
minimizing the actual contributions they need to obtain from DBEs.”  The 
USDOT’s Part 26 rule issued in 1999 significantly reduced the damaging practice 
of “backsubbing.”  Why would we now go back to the days of “pass-through” 
DBEs receiving large “sweetheart” deals from prime contractors and not 
performing commercially useful functions?

Both Option 2 and Option 3 opens the floodgates to “backsubbing” and will likely 
encourage prime contractors to inflate their internal “mark-ups” and overhead 
costs before “selling” it their DBE subcontractors.  Even if these prime contractor 
mark-ups and overhead costs are true and accurate costs, how does the FTA 
and/or their recipients challenge, audit, and accept or reject these alleged costs?  
Politically-connected DBEs performing minimal actual work will secure the lion’s 
share of “sweetheart” subcontracts while the legitimate value-added DBEs will be 
excluded.

The competition among railcar prime contractors is fierce and the successful 
bidder often wins the contract (whether negotiated or lowest 
responsive/responsible) with razor-thin profit margins.  Since these large prime 
contractors buy and/or produce their needed materials in such large quantities, 
it’s far more cost-efficient for them to make/buy as much as they can “in-house” 
and then “feed it back” via a DBE “pass-through”  to maximize DBE amounts while 
minimizing actual DBE participation.  This practice doesn’t level the playing field 
and significantly excludes many smaller DBEs from even showing up for the game 
(i.e., compete for and win business).

USDOT’s “question about normal industry practices…on a project in which DBE 
participation is not at issue…” in which the prime contractor does “typically simply 
make the commodity available on the job site, hiring the subcontractor just to do 
the installation work” nicely addresses the “backsubbing” problem.  If the prime 
contractor has a manufacturing or distribution facility for the commodity involved, 
the prime contractor does not “commonly sell the commodity to the 
subcontractor, who is then reimbursed by the prime contractor for the sale price 
as part of the subcontract price.”  Adding two additional steps needlessly 
increases the time and effort of labor and documentation costs to duplicate 
paperwork.  No one would bother to make that type of arrangement because it’s 
simply not cost-effective to extend the paper trail. Although it would lead to higher 
(i.e., artificially inflated) reported DBE participation, it would undermine, to an 
overwhelming extent, the principle of DBE participation.  

As stated in Section 26.55(c)(2), a DBE does not perform a commercially useful 
function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in a transaction, 
contract, or project through which funds are passed in order to obtain the 
appearance of DBE participation.”  
Since the DOT has made so many improvements to the DBE program - especially 
since the 1999 issuance of Part 26 – it’s difficult to justify regressing back to 
this “good old boy” approach. If the USDOT allows “backsubbing” to re-emerge, 
the creditability of the entire DBE program will be at risk.  

Option 4 is too extreme and would destroy business opportunities for DBE 
distributors (i.e., “regular dealers”).  If you examine a cross-section of Transit 
Vehicle Manufacturer (TVM) contracts among various recipients’ contracts, you’re 
likely to see half or more of a contract’s overall DBE “counting value” is derived 
from DBE distributors. Furthermore, it’s not uncommon for prime contractors to 
actively assist/mentor DBEs in sourcing supplies/services the DBE needs to 
distribute to the prime contractor.  A legitimate DBE distributor provides value-
added, secure, just-in-time, warehousing and inventory control services that the 
prime contractor can’t often perform itself in a cost-effective and efficient manner.

If Option 4 were enacted, recipients would be forced to significantly lower their 
DBE goals because the number of ready, willing and able DBE distributors would 
be excluded from the formula.  

Although not addressed specifically in this ANPRM, one area that seems to be 
abused occasionally by primes and larger non-DBE subcontractors (and not 
necessarily known by the FTA’s recipients) on major contracts (e.g., $50 million 
or more) is the practice of overstating a DBE’s actual “counting value” as 
described in Section 26.55(e).   Non-DBE primes and larger non-DBE 
subcontractors sometimes claim DBE regular dealers (worth 60% counting value) 
as manufacturers (worth 100% counting value) and/or claim “brokers” (i.e., neither 
manufacturers nor regular dealers worth only fees and commissions – perhaps 
only 5% to 10%) as regular dealers (worth 60% counting value).  

DBE manufacturers must perform more than mere kitting and re-labeling or turning 
a few screws to earn their 100% counting value.   DBE regular dealers must 
provide distribution services beyond that of a mere broker (who pushes a few 
papers yet rarely or never actually handles or even sees the product) to earn their 
60% counting value.  There is a wide discrepancy when comparing different 
recipients concerning how closely they monitor this improper behavior.  
Unfortunately, those non-DBE primes and larger non-DBE subcontractors that 
ignorantly view the DBE program as a burdensome mandate (instead of 
understanding the value of supplier diversity) and/or are more concerned with 
reporting higher (albeit illegitimate) DBE goal percentages may take advantage 
of “don’t ask, don’t tell” monitoring practices.  

One way to improve DBE “counting value” accuracy is for the DOT to define 
minimum standards for recipients’ DBE certification approval letters.  Upon issuing 
DBE certification letters, recipients should list the firm’s NAICS codes, matching 
workscopes/areas of expertise and corresponding DBE credit percentages (i.e., 
100 percent, 60 percent, fees and commissions), especially for those DBEs 
capable of performing as both a manufacturer and a distributor. Failing to do so 
encourages prime contractors to misrepresent the legitimate workscope 
contributions of potential DBE suppliers.  Reporting higher total contract dollars 
may “look good on the resume of a DBE to say that it had completed a relatively 
large project” but success in business should be based on actual performance of 
a commercially useful function.


Ways of encouraging recipients to break up contracts into smaller pieces that can 
more easily be performed by small businesses like DBEs, known as “unbundling.”

One of the inherent problems of the DBE rule from the transit vehicle manufacturer 
(TVM) perspective is that TVMs are required and expected to operate within rules 
better-suited for the construction side of transportation (e.g., building roads, 
bridges, tunnels, etc.).  Construction contracts by nature are more conducive to 
unbundling because there are not as many technical/engineering system 
integration requirements that essentially disqualify smaller companies in the TVM 
arena. In the passenger railcar industry, roughly 80% of the total materials are 
major components (e.g., propulsion, brakes, carshells, etc.)  It’s impractical and 
unrealistic, if not impossible, for recipients to unbundle many of a railcar’s major 
components.  For example, would the FTA expect a recipient’s engineer or 
program manager to unbundle its railcar HVAC unit so that the condenser is 
sourced out separately from the compressor while others bid on the metal 
fabrication or hardware or wiring – and then have others bid to build it? Would 
anyone buy an HVAC system for their own home in that manner?  Would it be 
cost-efficient?  

Many recipients require prime contractors to subcontract only to those major 
subsystem suppliers that are technically qualified to meet the recipient’s specific 
technical specifications (e.g., propulsion, auxiliary power, braking system, etc.). 
Generally, DBEs do not meet these major subsystem technical specifications. If 
you surveyed the 10 largest recipients and asked their program/project managers 
to send a list of their “technically approved” major system railcar component 
suppliers, you’d find very few, if any, DBEs on that list.  It’s not that DBEs aren’t 
capable of providing major components on a railcar – in fact, some already are 
and/or many more may be if given the opportunity.  However, in order to provide 
multi-million dollar major railcar components, a company’s sales level (i.e., 26.65 
term “gross receipts”) needed to offset the manufacturing costs (e.g., equipment, 
facilities, material, labor, engineering, etc.) would likely cause a DBE to lose its 
eligibility.  In other words, DBEs that build their business up to compete as a 
prime contractor are somewhat subsequently penalized by their success. 

A prime contractor’s ability to obtain second-tier DBE participation on the railcar 
major subsystems is limited by the amount they derive from non-DBE major 
system suppliers. If these non-DBE suppliers are single- or sole-source-listed by 
the recipient in the bid specification, the prime has no control over those suppliers’ 
level of second-tier DBE participation. Hence, many non-DBE major system 
suppliers offer minimal second-tier DBE participation, especially on a responsive 
approach contract. However, if there is more than one non-DBE supplier 
technically qualified by the recipient, the prime contractor should consider the 
potential subcontractor’s second-tier DBE participation as an important sub-bid 
evaluative criterion. 

Taking into account the limited DBE participation available on railcar major 
subsystems, prime contractors must maximize DBE participation through direct 
purchases from DBEs that provide supplies and services that are not within the 
major systems, such as metal fabrication, wire/cable and industrial hardware.  

Recipients can expand opportunities for DBEs another way.  Since all recipients 
now maintain a database of certified DBEs, they could cross-match the various 
workscopes contained within their bid specifications to each DBE’s NAICS 
Codes.  The recipient could “bulk e-mail” their bid specifications and a list of 
(anticipated) prime bidders to all cross-matched DBEs to bid upon (multiple) 
workscopes.  To illustrate this point, let’s presume metal fabrication, wire/cable, 
and industrial hardware are contained on all railcar bid specifications.  In this 
instance, a recipient issuing any railcar bid spec would automatically e-mail 
railcar bid specifications to any and all DBEs whose NAICS Codes correspond to 
metal fabrication, wire/cable, and industrial hardware.  Some TVMs and other 
prime bidders with a proactive DBE participation program are already utilizing this 
approach to enhance supplier diversity.

Contact unbundling should be done whenever and wherever practical.  The Mentor-
Protégé program could enhance contact unbundling in the railcar industry for 
everyone if the funding level increased and the administration/implementation was 
improved.  


Potential ways of improving the DBE application and personal new worth (PNW) 
forms.

There’s inconsistency in how recipients develop their PNW statements and 
interpret the financial data reported by DBE applicants. Some DBEs (and their 
accountants) find these forms both confusing and misleading.  If a DBE owner’s 
primary residence and the equity in their business doesn’t count toward their 
PNW, then some owners don’t understand why various recipients “dig deeper” 
than others into the DBE’s personal assets outside of their business. Instead of 
allowing recipients to (re)create additional burdensome and potentially intrusive 
documentation requirements, the DOT should standardize the PNW statement for 
all recipients or at least publish a “draft” version for industry comment via a future 
NPRM.

If any changes are made to what’s included/excluded in a DBE owner’s PNW, the 
owner’s equity should still remain excluded.  If a DBE owner’s primary residence 
is to be considered, the $750,000 cap must be raised.  Calculating ever-changing 
local real estate market values (e.g., a house in Buffalo is worth less than a 
similar house on Long Island) and/or cost of living adjustments may open up a 
never-ending debate.


Potential ways of improving program oversight.

Requiring prime contractors to report actual payments to DBEs, instead of the 
subcontract award amount, should keep everyone honest and accountable. The 
true value of any DBE program should always be measured by actual 
performance, not promises. The MARTA in Atlanta audits their prime contractors’ 
reported DBE supplier payments each quarter by directly contacting each “listed” 
DBE to verify the prime’s most recent and cumulative payments. 

Recipients have a choice between handling bidder compliance with contract goals 
as a matter of responsiveness (committing to specific DBE subcontractors “up-
front” in their bid submittals) or responsibility (committing to a DBE contract goal, 
but selecting DBE suppliers after the recipient has awarded the contract to the 
prime contractor). Many recipients prefer the responsiveness approach as a 
deterrent to bid-shopping while others believe the responsibility concept offers a 
more flexible and cost-effective approach. 

The DOT maintains that recipients should continue to use their own discretion on 
this issue.  However, my experience has shown that, on applicable DOT-assisted 
contract bid solicitations issued since the 1999 issuance of the Part 26 DBE rule, 
nearly all recipients have required prime contractors to abide by the 
responsiveness approach. In essence, this means guaranteeing all DBE 
subcontracts up front in their bid proposals through “DBE Letters of Intent.” 
Excerpts from Section 26.53 (b) reveal why recipients so consistently utilize the 
responsiveness approach in their bid solicitations: 
“In your solicitations for DOT-assisted contracts for which a contract goal has 
been established,…All bidders/offerors will be required to submit the following 
information to the recipient [recipient]…: (i)The names and addresses of DBE 
firms that will participate in the contract; (ii) A description of the work that each 
DBE will perform; (iii) The dollar amount of the participation of each DBE firm 
participating; (iv) Written documentation of the bidder/offeror's commitment to use 
a DBE subcontractor whose participation it submits to meet a contract goal; (v) 
Written confirmation from the DBE that it is participating in the contract as 
provided in the prime contractor's commitment;…”

Perhaps the reason the responsibility approach isn’t utilized by recipients is that 
this important option is (unintentionally) buried 12 paragraphs later in Section 
26.53 (e) which states:
“In a ‘design-build’ or ‘turnkey’ contracting situation, in which the recipient 
[recipient] lets a master contract to a [prime] contractor, who in turn lets 
subsequent subcontracts for the work of the project, a recipient may establish a 
goal for the project. The master contractor then establishes contract (DBE) goals, 
as appropriate, for the subcontracts it lets. Recipients must maintain oversight of 
the master contractor's activities to ensure that they are conducted consistent 
with the requirements of this part.”

These excerpts from the “Preamble” (or Background Information) section of the 
1999 issuance of the Part 26 DBE rule offer a good argument relevant to the 
railcar industry:
“…In a sense, the master contractor stands in the shoes of the recipient 
[recipient]. On design-build contracts, the normal process for setting contract 
goals does not fit the contract award process well. At the time of the award of the 
master contract, neither the recipient nor the master contractor knows in detail 
what the project will look like or exactly what contracting opportunities there will 
be, let alone the identity of DBEs who may subsequently be involved. In these 
situations, the recipient may alter the normal process, setting a project goal to 
which the master contractor commits. Later, when the master contractor is letting 
subcontracts, it will set contract goals as appropriate, standing in the shoes of the 
recipient…”

Some recipients prefer the responsiveness approach because some prime 
contractors commit to using specific DBEs in meeting their contractual goal and 
subsequently don’t honor their commitment (i.e., they don’t walk the talk). The 
solution is simple. Recipients should include in their contracts a financial penalty, 
equal (or greater) to the DBE shortfall amount, that the prime contractor must pay 
the recipient. Furthermore, the recipient must enforce this policy. 

Some recipients claim they prefer the responsiveness approach to avoid “bid 
shopping.” It is important to note the difference between bid shopping and 
competitive bidding. Bid shopping is when a prime contractor reveals the bid price 
of their potential DBE subcontractors to competing DBE subcontractors and 
requests that they beat the original price. This kind of bid shopping (DBE or non-
DBE) should never be allowed because it’s unethical to reveal proprietary 
information. However, allowing prime contractors to request competitive bids after 
the recipient has awarded the contract is not bid shopping - it’s capitalism. Since 
most recipients make awards to the lowest responsible bidder, it would make 
sense that prime contractors (if so compelled) should be able to use the same 
system to select their subcontractors, DBE or not.  Although some DBEs argue 
that this competition forces them to submit bid prices that are too low to provide 
them a reasonable profit margin, any business owner (DBE or not) must 
understand what constitutes a sensible, profitable bid. A DBE owner should be 
exposed to the same risks and rewards as any other entrepreneur. 

The practice of guaranteeing contracts with DBE firms prior to a contract award 
has been advocated in other business sectors, especially construction. In a fixed-
price construction bid, (when the design is substantially or totally defined and the 
contractor is dealing primarily with first-tier subcontractors whose scope of work 
can be determined based on that completed design), such a “lock-in” may make 
sense in order to assure achievement of a DBE goal. It’s widely acknowledged 
that the railcar industry differs from construction in that most DBE subcontracting 
opportunities are defined months and even years after a contract award. 
Recipients do not finalize many engineering designs until they have received and 
accepted the prime contractor's first prototype vehicle(s). A prime contractor’s 
ability to increase DBE participation is best-served when they’re entrusted with 
the responsibility for awarding DBE contracts throughout the duration of their 
multiyear contracts.  As an example, wire/cable assemblies are needed on a 
railcar remanufacturing project. How can a prime contractor or their potential major 
system suppliers guarantee up-front specific DBE names, workscopes, and 
dollars on a multi-year contract when the DBE wire/cable assembly firm won’t 
know the cost of copper six months hence?

A prime contractor’s procurement process is affected by provisions that 
encourage the use of second-tier DBE subcontractors, but that also require 
primes and their non-DBE major suppliers to obligate workscope and price to 
DBEs before the recipient’s award date. That, in effect, means that prime 
contractors and their non-DBE major system suppliers have almost no ability to 
adjust scope or price to conform to post-award approvals of neither major 
component specifications nor the prime contractor’s final executed purchase order 
with DBE suppliers. This subverts the normal relationship between contractor and 
subcontractor and places everyone, including the DBE, at risk of realistic 
adjustments to workscope and price.

When recipients require prime contractors to abide by the responsiveness 
approach, the few larger, well-established DBEs (who are capable of providing 
multiple subsystems) receive the lion’s share of the DBE subcontracts, effectively 
shutting out many up-and-coming DBEs who need more opportunities. When 
given the flexibility to select their DBE subcontractors throughout a contract’s 
duration, primes can often double the number of DBE participants. The overall 
contract DBE participation amount doesn’t necessarily increase (although it often 
does), but many more DBEs subsequently get a piece of the pie.

Prime contractors should be willing to contractually obligate themselves to an 
attainable DBE contract goal suggested by the recipient and should guarantee 
that level of DBE participation by certified DBE firms throughout the lifetime of the 
contract. The elimination of the requirement to obligate proposers to specific DBE 
firms for specific dollar amounts prior to contract award is in the best interest of all 
parties. DBEs participating in the bidding process throughout contract duration 
would be afforded more opportunity to compete and grow.


Potential ways of reducing burdens on firms seeking certification as DBEs in more 
than one state

My review of dozens of recipients’ DBE directories reveals no common format. 
Some directories sort alphabetically only by company name, others only 
numerically by NAICS code, and others only by workscope alphabetically (most 
useful of the 3). Even worse, many recipients will publish their DBE directories in 
only.pdf format or hard copy. This cumbersome format makes it impossible for 
anyone to sort and customize a list of potential DBEs that match their 
subcontracting needs.  The DOT should consider requiring all recipients to develop 
an on-line user-friendly DBE database similar to the NYSDOT’s that enables any 
user to sort and customize a potential DBE subcontractor list to meet their 
specific needs. 

Since out-of-state recipients aren’t required to accept an out-of-state DBE 
applicant’s home state certification, out-of-state DBE applicants often face 
unnecessary delays and unending requests for repetitive documentation.  Some 
recipients tell me they believe their own internal DBE application approval process 
is more thorough than an out-of-state DBE applicant’s home state recipient’s 
process and therefore they fear that the out-of-state applicant may have slipped 
through the path of least resistance.  If this is truly a concern, then perhaps the 
DOT should standardize a minimum set of application review procedures that all 
recipients must follow to insure no illegitimate applicants slip through the system.  
Since gathering 50 states’ worth of recipients’ DBE managers for discussion, 
resolution and training is unlikely, perhaps each of the 10 FTA Regional 
Administrators could work within their own geographic areas to standardize DBE 
application processing procedures.  

If you surveyed the larger recipients across the country and asked them to name 
the most thorough out-of-state recipients administering DBE certification, you’re 
likely to narrow it down to a short list.  The DOT could then observe the best 
recipients to see what makes them successful.   The New York MTA DBE 
certification process appears to be well-respected throughout at least the 
Northeast US (if not nationwide).  Although a “one state fits all (states)” scenario 
may be too large of a pill for recipients to swallow today, perhaps a DBE’s initial 
certification should be reciprocal within their FTA regional area for one year and 
then reciprocated on a national basis after 2 or 3 years. 

The recipient’s decision-making timeline in Section 26.83(k) is a major roadblock 
for DBE applicants because the 90-day “decision clock” never starts ticking 
until “receiving from the applicant firm all information required under this part.”  All 
information includes the recipient’s review of all of the DBE’s application 
documentation, the recipient’s “desk audit,” and the recipient’s on-site visit.  
DBEs sometimes wait several months waiting for recipients to schedule an on-site 
visit following their initial desk audit.  Recipients sometimes tell DBEs that, due to 
a lack of funding and/or travel authorization restrictions, the on-site visit is 
postponed until further notice.  In essence, the 90-day clock might not begin 
ticking until several months after a DBE submits their application.  Meanwhile, 
legitimate DBEs lose contracting opportunities because they lack certification.  
It’s a lose-lose Catch-22 because recipients will only count certified DBEs toward 
a bid/contact goal but recipients can’t/won’t certify pending DBE applicants before 
a bid due date.

Closing Statement

When you consider the transit industry’s ultimate customer base (the riders), 
minorities and women represent a significant portion, and perhaps a majority, of 
the market. It stands to reason that minorities and women should also be a 
significant part of the supplier base. Supplier diversity is a tremendous value to 
everyone and must succeed at every level.  DM2US thanks the DOT for their 
outstanding continuous efforts toward improving the DBE program and this 
opportunity to submit comments.

Please contact me whenever I may be of assistance. 

Respectfully yours,

Counting Credit for Items Obtained by DBEs From Non-DBE Sources

We support either option 1 or 2  as we have not experienced any of the problems
raised in the ANPRM with regard to counting credit for items obtained by DBEs
from non-DBE sources.

Contract Unbundling

We support unbundling contracts as a race neutral measure, however we feel that
additional regulatory requirements might place burdensome limitations on the
decision-making process.  We believe that the recipient must have some
flexibility to determine the structure of its own projects based on a balance of
many factors. We recommend additional guidance rather than regulatory
requirements to provide assistance to recipients in this area. 

Revised DBE Certification Application and Personal Net Worth Statement

We believe that the current application works very well in most situations.  It
would be beneficial to provide better instruction regarding affiliates,
including what documentation must be submitted.  In addition, specific contract
information (gross revenues, term, etc.) for ACDBE applicants would be helpful.

We strongly support a standardized PNW form.  In addition, the following added
information would be of benefit:

•	A listing of trusts for which the applicant owner is trustee or beneficiary
•	Guidance for valuing ownership interest in other firms
•	Information and instructions for claiming the exclusion of up to $3 million in
assets for ACDBE owners


Interstate Certifications

We believe that additional training is needed for certifiers before regulatory
requirements dealing with required reciprocity will work.  We support a
requirement for updated on-site reviews every three to five years.

Federal Register: April 8, 2009; Docket OST-2009 DBE Potential Program 
Improvements in 49 CFR Part 26
 
This NPRM proposes changes on 5 matters:
    1.  Counting of items obtained by a DBE subcontractor from its prime 
contractor -   The current DBE regulations doesn't allow the counting of supplies 
and materials purchased from the prime contractor.  This may put a contractor at 
a competitive disadvantage bidding a project where they are the only supplier of a 
product needed by subcontractors (e.g. the contractor owns all the ready mixes in 
a geographic area).  Other bidders can count the full DBE quote for subcontract 
(including materials) but the contractor with the ready mix must deduct the cost of 
concrete sold to the DBE firm.  The Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) feels 
the prime contractor should be allowed to count the cost of material/supplies sold 
to a DBE firm IF the DBE firm was not required to purchase the materials from the 
prime AND the cost of the materials sold to the DBE firm was at the same price 
the prime was quoting the cost of these materials to other contractors bidding the 
project.  We feel the biggest potential for abuse is in areas where the recipient is 
getting only one bidder and a contractor could increase their DBE commitment by 
artificially increasing the cost of materials sold to DBE firms.  We feel a recipient 
could independently check that the contractor was not overcharging DBE firms or 
the recipient could have a process where they react to complaints from other 
contractors as a method to ensure a contractor is not overcharging DBE firms to 
increase their DBE commitments.

    2.  Unbundling of contracts into smaller contracts – The Iowa DOT agrees it is 
in the best interest of our construction industry to have small contracts for which 
small contractors can complete and develop into larger contractors.  However we 
do not believe the US DOT should mandate it to their recipients. Rather we believe 
that the US DOT should provide guidance to recipients and expect some 
justification if the recipient is not offering some contracts for small contractors to 
complete for.
    3.  Improvement to the DBE application form – The NPRM suggestion is to 
make the standard DBE application form more comprehensive so individual 
recipients are not asking for additional information from applicants.  The NPRM 
also suggests changes to make the application form simpler to complete by DBE 
applicants. While the Iowa DOT supports both suggestions they seem to run 
counter to each other.  The Iowa DOT supports the formation of a task group to 
provide recommendations on a universal, comprehensive DBE Application Form 
which would be used by all recipients without additional information needed from 
the DBE applicant by individual recipients.  The NRPM also suggests recipients 
consider factors other than the $750,000 PNW for economically disadvantaged.  If 
other factors are to be considered the Iowa DOT feels they need to be consistent 
among all recipients rather than having each recipient develop their own factors for 
economically disadvantaged.  Therefore the other factors for recipients to consider 
should be listed in the regulations.
    
4.  Program Oversight - The NPRM suggests several changes to the regulations to 
facilitate interstate certification.  The Iowa DOT believes the DBE program has one 
set of certification requirements.  Therefore we feel that the submittal of the 
identical certification materials to multiple states is burdensome for DBE 
applicants.  We feel if all recipients follow the same DBE certification 
requirements then a firm certified by one recipient should be certified by all other 
recipients.  Therefore we believe a unitary certification system operated by the US 
DOT should be put into place.  If this is not possible to have one certification 
process by the US DOT then a reciprocal DBE certifications between recipients 
should be implemented with a challenge process that allows other recipients to 
challenge a certification which should ensure a recipient does not incorrectly 
certify a firm that doesn’t meet the federal DBE requirements.    

5.  Termination of a DBE for convenience - Some recipients allows the prime 
contractor to terminate a DBE for convenience once the prime contractor has 
achieved their DBE goal.  The Iowa DOT believes the contractor makes DBE 
commitments to the named DBE firms at the time of award and each named DBE 
firm must complete their commitment to each firm for the dollar amount they have 
agreed to as part of the prime contractor obligations. Therefore a contractor should 
not be able to cancel a commitment to a DBE firm just because they have used 
other DBE firms for work on the contract and have already exceeded the dollar 
amount of their overall DBE commitment.  A second proposal would require the 
prime contractor to subcontract additional work added to the contract to the DBE 
firm who performed the original work for this item on the contract.   The Iowa DOT 
feels DBE usage on change orders (e.g. additional work) should be addressed on 
an individual contract basis rather than having the federal regulations mandate 
additional regulations which may not fit every situation.  We feel it is the 
recipient’s responsibility to achieve their annual DBE goals and they should be 
given flexibility on how they achieve it.

provided or counted for other Federal or State programs. They must be unique
credits and once credited, can't be used again

2) Way to encourage recipients to break up contracts - Many studies point out
that by bundling products and services, costs and delivery terms increase. This
should be a large selling point to break up requirements. The basis of decisions
in this area is a thorough market analysis combined with a detailed spend
profile and supplier capability matrix. Recipents can also be required to
evaluate breakout as part of their procurement planning activity.

3) Improving the forms- No comment but the number of fields should be reduced.
What about having the applicant certify just like contractors certify their
business size. That would do away with the form altogether. Check out the State
of Maryland and State of Connecticut processes.

4) Improving Program Oversight- Evaluate the procurement plans for contracts
over $100,000 to ensure that the recipients have evaluated and documented
breakout opportunities; Use self surveys for field compliance; Test program
compliance on project sites; Ensure that the recipients are documented how they
are developing their annual plans; Interview DBEs doing business with recipients
to confirm programs; Look at trends and if they are improving, ask for
corrective actions; an on-line compliance tool can be created to track all 450
grantees

5) Reducing burdens- Reciprocal arrangements should be in place such that if one
State DOT has approved the DBE, it is accepted in all States. Requirements to
have DBEs meet requirements of all 50 States based on narrow differences in
State programs is extremely counterproductive.",,,,,,,

the ""facilitating interstate certification"" issue.

We strongly favor a DBE certification national reciprocity (within the existing UCP 
network), perhaps where the state that the firm is based in, is solely reponsibe for 
certification (that is then accepted by the other states).  In that the DBE 
certification standards that the states (UCPs) apply should be relatively-consistent 
nationwide (is based on the same set of DOT rules), a single certification of DBEs 
in the U.S. seems to make sense.  Having a state by state DBE certification 
requirement or even a reciprocity agreement among a few states (little sign that 
states are interested in this, in any case) unnecessarily imposes an additional 
burden on DBE firms, and others.

This is an issue for us because our contracts (where we require consultant 
services) are typically for professional, specialized technical work, and are 
relatively small, in the under $400,000 federal dollars range.  Many of the prime 
contractors that we require are not located in Ohio and, in turn, the primes often 
select DBEs (subcontractors) that are also located in other states and regions of 
the country.  Often, to meet the MPO DBE goal, more than one DBE firm is 
included in the contract work.  Under current rules, it is our understanding, that to 
get DBE firm participation 'credit,' we are required to have these DBEs get certified 
in Ohio, if they are not already.

We feel that this puts an unnecessary extra burden on the DBEs and on the 
prime contractor (and on us), for the relatively small, non-construction contracts 
that we have.  This is in cases where the prime is already putting in the extra 
effort to meet or exceed our contract DBE goal (usually 12%).  We would like to 
be free to accept DBE certfications from other states, and eliminate the step of 
getting Ohio UCP certification (unless the firm is based in Ohio).

Again, one way to do this might be to make the home state of a firm provide 
certification, as the home state UCPs are probably in the best position to 
determine eligibility and to keep DBE status current (perhaps, eventually, DOT 
could maintain a single database of all eligible DBEs, accessible via the DOT 
website).  There could then be a mandatory presumption (without additional 
documentation required) that the firm is certified per DOT requirements.  This 
would simplify the certification process and delays to potential DBEs, and for 
others involved in the process.

If states want to be able to verify the certification documents provided by a DBE 
firm, the state that did the certification could be required to provide the application 
package, and an opportunity for contesting the certification provided.  If it turns out 
that some states are not performing the certifications per DOT requirements 
(perceived uneven quality of certifications), this could be addressed on an 
individual state basis.

Thanks for the opportunity for comment.

This purpose of this letter is to comment on the proposed rulemaking related to 
the Department of Transportation’s DBE Program—specifically the Revised DBE 
Certification Application and Personal Net Worth Statement.  

Outreach Process Partners, Inc. (OPP) is a woman-owned small business that 
participates in the DBE program and we appreciate the opportunity to comment.  
Specifically:

Date of Birth and Retirement Savings: We agree strongly that date of birth should 
be included in the application and a reasonable, age-appropriate allowance for 
retirement savings be excluded from the Personal Net Worth (PNW) calculation.  
Under the current program, all 401-k, IRA and similar retirement savings accounts 
are calculated in PNW.   This gives an unfair advantage to younger individuals and 
individuals with pension plans.  For individuals with pension plans, only the 
income from the pension is considered—not the financial value of the pension 
itself.  These pensions are typically life-long and adjust upward with Cost of 
Living.  To purchase a similar annuity plan would cost hundreds of thousands of 
dollars.  Likewise, including retirement savings in the PNW give an advantage to 
younger applicants (with less experience) over older applicants who have 
responsibly saved for their retirement. Our recommendation is to develop a 
reasonable calculation of responsible retirement savings based on age—and 
exclude that amount from the PNW total.

Overall Household PNW:  We also agree that overall household assets should be 
considered in the PNW. As you mentioned, the current program encourages the 
titling of assets in other household member’s names. Likewise, focusing on 
spouses is yet another disincentive for couples to get married in our society.  The 
current rate of births of unwed babies in the U.S. is approaching 50%.  This is 
fueled in part by policies that penalize marriage—as this one does.  We believe 
the overall assets of the household—individuals living at the same address, 
regardless of family ties—should be factored into the PNW.  This would level the 
playing field between those who are married and those who are simply living 
together, especially if they have been living together for over a year (clearly a 
committed relationship). If an individual claiming disadvantage is living in a palace 
with all of his/her bills paid, they are not economically disadvantaged—in fact they 
are quite advantaged over the rest of us with bills to worry about while trying to 
make a business succeed.  In this model, the total household assets should not 
exceed 2X the individual PNW limit.

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this announcement. We appreciate 
the opportunity to participate in the DBE program and your efforts to make the 
program fairer.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or 
require further clarification.

RE: DBE Program; Potential Program Improvements 
       Docket No OST-20009 
       Agency: Office of the Secretary, DOT

Dear Mr. LaHood, 

Thank for the opportunity to provide comment on the proposed rulemaking
regarding 49 CFR Part 26. As an attorney, I have represented small, socially and
economically disadvantaged businesses seeking participation as a DBE in
federally-assisted contracts in all but two of our nation’s states. Thus, I have
developed a great deal of practical experience and knowledge of the
administration of Part 26 and its effectiveness at leveling the competitive
playing field for DBEs seeking participation in such contracts.	

PROPERLY EMPHASIZE PART 26 OBJECTIVES REGARDING INCREASED DBE COMPETITIVENESS 

While the Objectives of Part 26 include ensuring that only qualified DBEs are
certified for participation in this program, the program’s written objectives
place much more emphasis on increasing a DBE’s ability and opportunity to
compete for federally-assisted contracts. In practice, however, recipients
throughout the nation place the largest amount of their resources on the
certification objective, with post-contract-award compliance enforcement drawing
the second largest share of a program’s energies. The “playing field”—or RFP
solicitation and pre-award competitive process, is largely ignored. Given this
context, it is not surprising that there are no studies that present a
statistically significant improvement in the competitiveness of DBEs for
DOT/FAA-assisted contracts, much less any study that concludes that any
improvement can be directly attributed to the implementation of Part 26.

In terms of competition for the award of a contract, the only real DBE program
mechanism designed to effect the “playing field” is the program’s monitoring of
a Prime’s “good faith effort” in complying with the contract’s “DBE
Participation Goal”. However, Primes and program administrators throughout the
nation engage in a myriad of practices that result in the appearance of
compliance with Part 26 regulations, but that, in substance, circumvent the
intent of the program and regulations. 

Some of those practices, as engaged in by Primes, include:

1)	Submitting “Good Faith Certification” forms which fail to list all DBEs that
presented themselves to the Prime as Ready, Willing, and Able (RWA) DBEs for the
project. Thus, when a DBE program administrator contacts the DBE’s on the Good
Faith Certification form, the administrator is never made aware of other DBEs
that expressed to that Prime its interest in participating in the project/contract.
2)	Engaging in negotiations with, and obtaining commitments from, DBE firms even
though its (the Prime’s) intent is to submit a Proposal with a “Good Faith”
waiver request, and with the intent of submitting a proposal that omits the
committed DBE.
3)	Sending “blast” solicitations of participation to DBE’s whose business is in
no way related to the subject matter of the project.
4)	Rejecting interested DBEs on the grounds that:
a)	“The DBE is redundant to the team”—i.e. that the Prime will go with a NON-DBE
to obtain the services or materials provided by the DBE. This justification is a
blatant rejection of the overall intent of Part 26, and, ergo, ought to be a
presumption of non-compliance with Part 26;
b)	“The selection committee will only count black-owned DBEs towards the DBE
participation goal.” This reason is given even where no properly-supported
race-specific goal has been created, as in the City of Birmingham;
c)	“The selection committee will only count local DBE’s towards the DBE
participation goal.” This reasoning is farcical given that projects which
trigger DBE program requirements are usually sought after by Primes and DBEs
from across the region, and even from across the nation; and
d)	“The RFP mandates consideration of only DBEs that are on the local DBE
list.”This justification is given even where the RFP clearly allows for
out-of-state DBE participation in the contract (which, by the way, is allowed on
most of the RFPs that I have read).
 
These types of practices are common throughout the industry, and are used to
such an extent that Primes everywhere are engaging in conduct that strongly
suggests that they consider compliance with DBE program requirements, especially
at the contract competition phase, as an optional rule of play on this playing
field. 

Thus, it is critical to the substantive implementation of Part 26 that DBE
programs close these gaps by either requiring the Prime to pull DBEs from a
national list of DBEs or by maintaining a reporting mechanism whereby all DBEs
can learn of RFPs and all interested DBEs can register their interest in
participating in any given project, or by requiring both activities. By
requiring both, a DBE compliance officer can refer to the “Interest
Registration” list to use in the verification of a Prime’s good faith efforts,
and Primes will be less able to avoid real compliance with Part 26. 

RECOGNIZE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PLAYING FIELD IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF PART 26

Please also consider the following situational factors that contribute to
reducing the effectiveness of Part 26 in achieving its “playing field” objectives:

1)	Participants in federally-assisted contracts come from a regional and a
national pool of contractors and sub-contractors. Yet, DBE programs base their
disparity studies and “market area” on a much smaller geographic area. This
basis, and the recipient’s resulting “pool” of DBEs, falls egregiously short of
a real or accurate reflection of the actual playing field for these contracts.
To compound the problem, project administrators occasionally require a currently
certified out-of-state DBE to be “in-state” certified before the RFP submittal
deadline. These practices demonstrate that being a certified DBE hardly gets the
disadvantaged business unto the playing field, much less able to move about it
with the other competitors.
2)	Primes are usually large firms that also often have internal marketing
departments with teams of 10, 20, or more individuals to prepare proposals.
Truly small, socially and economically disadvantaged businesses do not have such
resources, and often cannot afford to allocate staff to the writing of
proposals, even though they are competent to deliver on the project. Currently,
I know of no recipient that addresses this situation.
3)	Often Primes further restrict the DBE’s competitiveness by requiring the DBE
to commit exclusively to that Prime and/or prohibit the DBE from participating
in any other Prime’s team. 
4)	Project administrators do not, as an industry practice, allow DBE
sub-contractors to compete independently from non-DBE Primes for portions of a
federally-assisted contract. Further, it is unrealistic for a DBE—especially a
professional services DBE, to spontaneously indicate their interest in a project
by submitting a proposal or cost estimate to a Prime, as the DBE will not be
privy to the Prime’s approach to the project and to the Prime’s intended scope
of work for any necessary team members. Here again, the DBE is ineffective as a
real competitor for any portion of the federally-assisted contract.
5)	Large Non-DBE Primes do not compete for the federally-assisted contracts that
are too small to trigger compliance with Part 26. Yet, project administrators
are not required to consider DBEs participation for these contracts, even though
many DBEs would appreciate increased opportunity to compete for them.

In order give substance to the implementation of Part 26, DBE program
administrators must routinely survey and educate themselves as to the practices
occurring during the RFP process, and must use that information to develop
initiatives that are narrowly tailored to achieve the Part 26 objectives
regarding DBEs’ competitiveness and opportunities.

REQUIRE CERTIFICATION VIA RECIPROCITY

The current practice by ALL recipients of refusing to recognize out-of-state
DBEs imposes an unfair and excessive burden on socially and economically
disadvantaged businesses, and unreasonably restricts the DBEs ability to compete
for any federally-assisted contract in which it is RWA to participate. This
situation must be corrected.

A survey of my own DBE clients demonstrates that Part 26 has done little to
strengthen DBEs’ competiveness for federally-assisted contracts. In fact,
participation in the DBE presents as an unjustifiable cost to the economically
disadvantaged business. I found that, on average, my DBE clients spent $1.80 to
be awarded $1.00 as a DBE on federally-assisted contracts. The survey also
demonstrates that my DBE clients spent an average of 8.5 hours completing the
certification application (excluding site-visit), and an average of $600 in
incidental costs to prepare and submit the application. 

Given that transportation construction projects are not the type to repeat
themselves frequently, contractors and DBEs whose mainstay is transportation
construction must seek work across a wide geographic range. However, even though
the CFR’s allow for certification via reciprocity, only two states in fifty have
offered even a truncated certification process. Not one state offers
certification via reciprocity. Thus, a DBE must submit complete certification
applications to many recipients if it wants to be considered as a DBE
participant for transportation projects occurring throughout its own market area.

This situation is untenable and undermines the entire DBE program. 

Its continued existence is made even more egregious given that the certification
process and form is narrowly prescribed by Part 26 and that recipients are
mandated not to stray from the process or the form. That recipients are allowed
to claim a general distrust of other recipients’ certification process is
unreasonable and shoves the burden of the program on the very entities the
program is designed to benefit: socially and economically disadvantaged businesses.

Certification via reciprocity should be the rule. Further, once certified under
a Part 23 or Part 26 administered program, the DBE should be listed as a
properly certified DBE throughout the nation. It should then be the
responsibility of the recipient to demonstrate cause for requiring submittal of
an application from a properly certified DBE. 

DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT, AND MONITOR A STRONGER OVERSIGHT PROGRAM FOR NON-PRIMARY
RECIPIENTS

Currently, Non-Primary Recipients number in the hundreds once municipalities and
regional transportation organizations are tallied. Yet, even though these
entities are required to comply with Part 26, I rarely find that such a
recipient has substantively met the requirements of the Part. Almost every
recipient-municipality or recipient-regional transportation entity that I have
encountered has either deviated grossly from the Parts’ requirements and
objectives, or has simply wholly failed to meet them. 

Further, it is not uncommon for such a recipient to issue an RFP, yet to make no
information available regarding their DBE program, its staff, its policies, or
its monitoring and enforcement strategies. A recipient’s failure to publish or
to provide public access to any DBE program statements, mechanisms, etc. renders
the recipient’s participation goals easily ignored or manipulated by Primes and
even by project managers, as happened recently in the City of Birmingham.
Further, when the recipient does not advertise information on how, or to whom,
to present concerns about their DBE program, the contract award process, etc.,
this leaves the concerned party with little recourse other than to pursue a
formal complaint or litigation to resolve what may be best resolved informally.
Unfortunately, it is also not uncommon for federal offices that are responsible
for oversight of these recipients to be completely unaware of the recipient’s
non-compliance.

Thus, a comprehensive oversight or auditing program of Non-Primary Recipients’
DBE Program would be instrumental in providing information to recipient DBE
program administrators. Further, every recipient that issues a RFP should be
required to coincidentally publish the entirety of their DBE program policies
and enforcement mechanisms, as well as the contact information for the office or
personnel responsible for processing concerns and complaints, whether formal or
informal. Failure to do so should trigger a timely audit and imposition of
appropriate adjustments.

SUMMARY OF COMMENTS

For the following reasons, current administrative policies and procedures
greatly reduce Part 26’s effectiveness at creating opportunities for DBE
participation in federally-assisted contracts, and impose significant undue
burdens on DBE’s seeking participation in the Part 26 program. 

First, DOT civil rights officers and DBE program administrators across the
country place the majority of their programs’ energies on the certification
process. This practice is at the expense of developing, implementing, and
monitoring policies and procedures which provide substance to Part 26’s other
objectives, especially those intent on leveling the “competitive” playing field
and creating opportunities for DBE involvement in federally-assisted contracts. 

Second, because DBE programs, policies, and administrators fail to implement and
monitor substantive programs aimed at the RFP solicitation process,
non-disadvantaged firms continue to engage in a myriad of techniques that
circumvent DBE participation goals and render the program without substance.

Third, DBE program administrators across the country deviate from the intent and
letter of Part 26’s certification procedures and form. Part 26 creates a
narrowly-tailored certification process that requires use of a specific form.
However, most recipients claim that others’ certification process is so
deficient that they require the DBE to “re-apply” by submitting an entirely new
application. Recognition of Part 26’s focus on uniformity of process and on
assistance to the DBE is obliterated by the failure of every single recipient to
offer certification via reciprocity. 

Fourth, DOT Civil Rights Regional offices have not published nor implemented an
oversight policy or program that specifically regulates the DBE programs of the
hundreds of Non-Primary Recipients of federal transportation monies. These
Non-Primary Recipients are often municipalities or regional transportation
bodies that are also required to comply with Part 26. However, the large
majority of these recipients that I have encountered fail the requirements, and
the objectives, of Part 26, in any number of ways. Further, it is extremely
difficult to find the recipients’ DBE program material or officers’ contact
information, and the intent of Part 26 is often subverted into serving the
recipient’s unique agenda. Thus, Part 26 is rendered without substance in a
large number of areas throughout the country.

To address these concerns, please consider the following broadly described
changes to the administration of Part 26:
1)	Adjust administrative emphases to better encompass all stated objectives of
the programs, giving more balanced attention to the objectives of;
		a) ensuring “nondiscrimination in the award and administration of
                                  DOT- assisted contracts”(§26.1(a)); 
		b) creating “a level playing field on which DBEs can compete fairly for
                                 DOT-assisted contracts” (§26.1(b)); and
		c) removing “barriers to the participation of DBEs in DOT-assisted 		         
                                  contracts”(§26.1(e)).
2)	realize and incorporate a thorough understanding of actual competitive
practices into DBE programs’ enforcement and monitoring procedures;
3)	Require all recipients to honor another recipient’s certification—i.e. for
all DBEs that were properly certified by their home-state, presume certification
via reciprocity is the appropriate path for certification by all other
recipients or DBE programs; and
4)       Implement a comprehensive and public auditing program regarding Non-Primary
Recipients’ DBE programs (such as those required of municipalities and regional
transportation organizations), and make information gleaned from the audits
available to all DBEs and DBE program administrators throughout the country.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, my experience with Part 26 leads me to conclude that oversight of
this program must occur under the philosophy that the program’s ultimate
objective is not to define the players or to effect the people, but to effect
the process.

Thank you for your consideration of my comments. If you have any questions,

RE:  	Office of the Secretary, DOT
	Docket Number OST-2009

To Whom It May Concern:

My company, Beth’s Barricades, became a certified DBE through the PaUCP 
program in 2006. I recently submitted my recertification packet to the Allegheny 
County PaUCP office and while completing the Recertification Application, I 
concluded that the program application is outdated. Specifically, the Personal Net 
Worth Statement should be revised to exclude IRA/other retirement account as an 
Asset.   

By placing IRA or other retirement account under the Assets table, the 
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program is encouraging business owners to 
consider cashing out their retirement funds and using them as a potential crutch 
for their business.  Why endorse funding a business this way when significant 
lack of retirement funds is a prevalent theme within America today?  

According to the 2008 Retirement Confidence Survey (Employee Benefit Research 
Institute and Matthew Greenwald & Associates, Inc.):
•	Twenty-five percent of women have neither retirement savings nor other 
savings, compared with 18 percent of men.  
•	62% of Men and 63% of Women expect to work for pay in retirement. 
Women highlighted keeping company health insurance and wanting money to 
make ends meet as the main reasons.
•	In recent years, savings outside of pensions has actually been 
negative.  The lack of individual saving outside of pensions is confirmed by the 
2004 Survey of Consumer Finances, which shows the typical household is 
approaching retirement with less than $30,000 of financial assets.     

Within the past 25 years, the retirement landscape has dramatically changed.  
Due to escalating costs, the days of a company taking care of its employees via a 
defined benefit pension plan are gone. Today, employees are encouraged to 
contribute to their primary retirement vehicle, the company sponsored 401(k) plan, 
and pay a portion, if not all of their health care costs. 

In addition, the Federal Government retirement plans, Social Security and 
Medicare, face their own challenges.  Social Security will provide less in the future 
than it does today because of increased retirement age from 65 to 67, and 
Medicare Part B premium will increase from 9.4% to 11.8% in 2030.  
Acknowledging the uncertainty of Social Security, Medicare and lack of individual 
retirement savings, President Obama has proposed an automatic workplace 
pension plan and mandatory enrollment in IRAs to strengthen retirement savings.  

Consequently, the onus of funding retirement now falls solely on the individual’s 
shoulders.  If the retirement plan is consistently funded over a period of time, the 
employee can obtain his long-term goals.  

If the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program would still like to include the 
IRA or other retirement account as an asset, a solution would be to include it as 
an asset only if the individual is older than 59 ½  and has redeemed/converted his 
retirement account.   In this case, the amount listed under assets would be the 
redeemed amount less any taxes.  If the individual is less than 59 ½, the 
IRA/other retirement account should be excluded.  

In conclusion, I strongly encourage the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise 
Program to exclude IRA/other retirement account as an Asset on the Personal 
Net Worth Statement.   Due to proposals supported by the Federal Government 
and President Obama and the disappearance of the traditional defined benefit 
pension plan, the individual has no choice but to control his own retirement 
destiny through contribution to any available retirement accounts.

contractors to terminate DBE’s for convenience, once the prime contractor has
committed to using the DBE as part of good faith efforts. The intent of the
revisions is to make more meaningful the commitment of the prime contractor to
the particular DBE firm that was part of the contract award process. 

It is recommended that the sixth concern be revised to include the wording,
“When a prime contractor has relied on a commitment to a DBE firm to meet all or
part of a contract goal, the prime contractor could not terminate the DBE firm
for convenience without the recipient’s written approval, based on a good cause
for termination.” 

DBE firms invest large sums of time and financial energy during the proposal
process and are terminated before the initial percentage goals have been met.
The larger firms use a ""Divide and Conquer"" technique, intimidating smaller
firms with the the threat that they will not be able to work with the larger
firm again. This abuse should be recognized by the DOT and addressed. This
clause should protect the DBE from this type of activity. Without this
protection, the smaller firms are pitted ""Brother against Brother,"" and the
cohesion of the Small and Disadvantaged Businesses group organizations is
thereby diminished. Who is promised the work and who later gets the work are two
different firms sitting at the same table, trying to get along. There is a lot
of tension in the air. This is not a good working atmosphere. Also, one never
knows when the big firm might change their mind, which has a tremendous impact
on the financial stability of the small firms.

Also recommended is an amendment to section 26.53 to “require the recipient, as
a result of a change order, to approve a decision by the prime contractor to
give a significant increment of work to a second DBE subcontractor without the
initial DBE subcontractor meeting all or part of its contract goal.” 

Currently, large pieces of transportation design assigned to one firm, are
transferred to a second firm under the guise of a change order. The change order
may be minimal, but a much larger body of work is attached to it and then
transferred to a second firm. This leaves the first firm out in the cold.

Recommended is an amendment to section 26.53 to “require the recipient, as a
result of a change order, to approve a decision by the prime contractor to give
a significant increment of work to a second DBE subcontractor without the
initial DBE subcontractor meeting all or part of its contract goal.” In other
words, the first DBE should be notified and allowed to discuss the change order
and the ramifications to their original work.

In response to USDOT Docket Numbers OST-2009-0081 and OST-2009-0082 
issued April 8, 2009, Diversity Matters 2 US, LLC (“DM2US”), an independent 
consulting firm specializing in DBE participation and Buy America compliance, 
respectfully submits the following comments:

DM2US would be honored to participate in the stakeholder meetings that bring 
together prime contractors, DBEs and state and local government representatives 
to discuss ways of improving administration of the DBE program. During my 15-
year career, I have managed more than $200 million in subcontract awards and 
payments to DBE, MBE and WBE subcontractors and provided DBE and Buy 
America training to more than 400 employees worldwide. 

The comments stated below may contain excerpts from the author’s previous 
written statements to USDOT, FTA, FTA recipients, APTA, and/or other transit-
related and/or supplier diversity-focused organizations.  


Docket Number OST-2009-0081
How recipients set overall goals

Although the actual results of my past TVM annual goal-setting projections (i.e., 
each FY’s actual DBE goal attainment) were relatively accurate, it was an 
extremely challenging and time-consuming responsibility to “guesstimate” 
specifically when all subcontracts (not just DBE’s) would be awarded because 
production/delivery schedules changed so frequently.  The DOT might consider 
giving recipients the choice between an annual DBE goal and a 2 year fiscal 
period with the option of revising their goal after the first year. 

A significant percentage of government officials are elected during even-numbered 
years (e.g., 2006, 2008, etc.) and subsequently begin their term the following 
January of an odd-numbered year (e.g., 2007, 2009, etc.).  These newly (re-)
elected government officials may inherit existing transportation multiple-year 
budgets/projects/proposals and/or develop new ones based upon needs, funding 
and their personal views toward public transportation.  This ever-changing political 
landscape makes it difficult for recipients to accurately estimate a DBE goal 
beyond one year.

A far more important issue is how goals are set. Although recipients may be 
required to publish their annual DBE percentage goals (perhaps broken down by 
race-conscious and race-neutral amounts), I’ve yet to see any that define how 
they established their percentage.  These DBE goal public notices often state that 
their methodology is available for inspection (only) on-site for (only) 30 days.  
Recipients should be required to post their DBE goal-setting methodologies on 
their website so that bidders/proposers (both DBE and non-DBE) can see for 
themselves which workscopes were/are identified for “ready, willing, and able” 
DBEs.  It’s not well understood at the prime and subcontractor level why this 
information is so difficult to access, especially since public (i.e., taxpayer) funds 
are involved.  Some speculate that, with some recipients, politics may affect DBE 
goal percentages more than available workscopes and therefore expanded public 
access could reveal unsubstantiated goal-setting methodologies.

Establishing an overall fiscal DBE goal, regardless of the time period, is similar to 
projecting sales/income and awards/subcontracts in any organization – it’s based 
upon the larger actual known contracts awarded and pending awards (e.g., 
Notices to Proceed). Some contracts are simply more conducive to DBE 
participation than others.  The DBE goal for any specific time period should 
depend upon various factors such as the type of work involved, the location of the 
work, and the availability of qualified ready, willing and able DBEs. 

Within the passenger railcar industry, some bids are for the remanufacturing 
(refurbishment) of existing vehicles. Since recipients’ DBE goal-setting guidelines 
are neither restricted nor perhaps monitored by the FTA on remanufacturing bids, 
recipients sometimes set DBE goal percentages that, in some cases, are 
technically and/or commercially unattainable. Some recipients set the same 
percentage DBE goal on every eligible bid based upon the anticipated total 
contract value, regardless of available workscopes for ready, willing, and able 
DBEs.  

Some recipients actually do compare NAICS codes and their corresponding 
workscopes to the items needed to build their railcars when establishing DBE 
goals.  However, NAICS codes do not necessarily mean any or all DBEs within a 
certain NAICS code actually possess the capability to perform on a railcar 
contract. For example, there are several DBE truckers and transportation 
suppliers located throughout the country. Included in this list are dump trucks, 
gravel haulers, and food delivery vehicles. However, there are very few, if any, 
DBEs capable of transporting 85-foot carshells or over-dimensional components 
(e.g., locomotive truck assemblies containing traction motors, wheels, and axles). 
The most practical way for a recipient to accurately measure the number of 
capable DBE firms within certain NAICS codes on a railcar contract bid is to 
closely examine the bid specification and determine who is technically qualified to 
perform the work.

Currently, some recipients’ DBE directors do not discuss with their own 
procurement departments what DBE goals they believe are attainable prior to their 
bid specification’s release. It’s time to re-build and strengthen this very important 
relationship.  Recipients need to bring together their engineering, procurement, 
new bids, contract management and DBE departments in order to agree on what 
is a reasonable, attainable DBE goal for each specific contract. Anticipated prime 
bidders and experienced, eligible DBEs could also be involved in the goal setting 
process.  Once a sensible DBE goal is established, prime bidders should make a 
commitment to meet and exceed that goal.
 
Docket Number OST-2009-0082
DBE Program; Potential Program Improvements


Counting of DBE credit for items obtained by DBE contractors from other sources, 
particularly the prime contractor for whom they are working on for a particular 
contract.

Option 1 should remain unchanged to help insure the spirit and intent of the DBE 
program.  Unfortunately, too many individual decision-makers on the prime 
contractor/subcontractor side do not understand the value of supplier diversity.  
Some of these individuals view DBE participation as a recipient- and/or FTA-
mandated cost-driver and will do nearly anything to inflate their DBE “numbers” 
while reducing their DBEs’ actual workscopes.

I strongly agree with the USDOT’s response to Ohio DOT that “doing so (i.e., 
counting the prime contractor’s materials issued to the DBE subcontractor) would 
have the effect of permitting prime contractors to meet the DBE goals while 
minimizing the actual contributions they need to obtain from DBEs.”  The 
USDOT’s Part 26 rule issued in 1999 significantly reduced the damaging practice 
of “backsubbing.”  Why would we now go back to the days of “pass-through” 
DBEs receiving large “sweetheart” deals from prime contractors and not 
performing commercially useful functions?

Both Option 2 and Option 3 opens the floodgates to “backsubbing” and will likely 
encourage prime contractors to inflate their internal “mark-ups” and overhead 
costs before “selling” it their DBE subcontractors.  Even if these prime contractor 
mark-ups and overhead costs are true and accurate costs, how does the FTA 
and/or their recipients challenge, audit, and accept or reject these alleged costs?  
Politically-connected DBEs performing minimal actual work will secure the lion’s 
share of “sweetheart” subcontracts while the legitimate value-added DBEs will be 
excluded.

The competition among railcar prime contractors is fierce and the successful 
bidder often wins the contract (whether negotiated or lowest 
responsive/responsible) with razor-thin profit margins.  Since these large prime 
contractors buy and/or produce their needed materials in such large quantities, 
it’s far more cost-efficient for them to make/buy as much as they can “in-house” 
and then “feed it back” via a DBE “pass-through”  to maximize DBE amounts while 
minimizing actual DBE participation.  This practice doesn’t level the playing field 
and significantly excludes many smaller DBEs from even showing up for the game 
(i.e., compete for and win business).

USDOT’s “question about normal industry practices…on a project in which DBE 
participation is not at issue…” in which the prime contractor does “typically simply 
make the commodity available on the job site, hiring the subcontractor just to do 
the installation work” nicely addresses the “backsubbing” problem.  If the prime 
contractor has a manufacturing or distribution facility for the commodity involved, 
the prime contractor does not “commonly sell the commodity to the 
subcontractor, who is then reimbursed by the prime contractor for the sale price 
as part of the subcontract price.”  Adding two additional steps needlessly 
increases the time and effort of labor and documentation costs to duplicate 
paperwork.  No one would bother to make that type of arrangement because it’s 
simply not cost-effective to extend the paper trail. Although it would lead to higher 
(i.e., artificially inflated) reported DBE participation, it would undermine, to an 
overwhelming extent, the principle of DBE participation.  

As stated in Section 26.55(c)(2), a DBE does not perform a commercially useful 
function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in a transaction, 
contract, or project through which funds are passed in order to obtain the 
appearance of DBE participation.”  
Since the DOT has made so many improvements to the DBE program - especially 
since the 1999 issuance of Part 26 – it’s difficult to justify regressing back to 
this “good old boy” approach. If the USDOT allows “backsubbing” to re-emerge, 
the creditability of the entire DBE program will be at risk.  

Option 4 is too extreme and would destroy business opportunities for DBE 
distributors (i.e., “regular dealers”).  If you examine a cross-section of Transit 
Vehicle Manufacturer (TVM) contracts among various recipients’ contracts, you’re 
likely to see half or more of a contract’s overall DBE “counting value” is derived 
from DBE distributors. Furthermore, it’s not uncommon for prime contractors to 
actively assist/mentor DBEs in sourcing supplies/services the DBE needs to 
distribute to the prime contractor.  A legitimate DBE distributor provides value-
added, secure, just-in-time, warehousing and inventory control services that the 
prime contractor can’t often perform itself in a cost-effective and efficient manner.

If Option 4 were enacted, recipients would be forced to significantly lower their 
DBE goals because the number of ready, willing and able DBE distributors would 
be excluded from the formula.  

Although not addressed specifically in this ANPRM, one area that seems to be 
abused occasionally by primes and larger non-DBE subcontractors (and not 
necessarily known by the FTA’s recipients) on major contracts (e.g., $50 million 
or more) is the practice of overstating a DBE’s actual “counting value” as 
described in Section 26.55(e).   Non-DBE primes and larger non-DBE 
subcontractors sometimes claim DBE regular dealers (worth 60% counting value) 
as manufacturers (worth 100% counting value) and/or claim “brokers” (i.e., neither 
manufacturers nor regular dealers worth only fees and commissions – perhaps 
only 5% to 10%) as regular dealers (worth 60% counting value).  

DBE manufacturers must perform more than mere kitting and re-labeling or turning 
a few screws to earn their 100% counting value.   DBE regular dealers must 
provide distribution services beyond that of a mere broker (who pushes a few 
papers yet rarely or never actually handles or even sees the product) to earn their 
60% counting value.  There is a wide discrepancy when comparing different 
recipients concerning how closely they monitor this improper behavior.  
Unfortunately, those non-DBE primes and larger non-DBE subcontractors that 
ignorantly view the DBE program as a burdensome mandate (instead of 
understanding the value of supplier diversity) and/or are more concerned with 
reporting higher (albeit illegitimate) DBE goal percentages may take advantage 
of “don’t ask, don’t tell” monitoring practices.  

One way to improve DBE “counting value” accuracy is for the DOT to define 
minimum standards for recipients’ DBE certification approval letters.  Upon issuing 
DBE certification letters, recipients should list the firm’s NAICS codes, matching 
workscopes/areas of expertise and corresponding DBE credit percentages (i.e., 
100 percent, 60 percent, fees and commissions), especially for those DBEs 
capable of performing as both a manufacturer and a distributor. Failing to do so 
encourages prime contractors to misrepresent the legitimate workscope 
contributions of potential DBE suppliers.  Reporting higher total contract dollars 
may “look good on the resume of a DBE to say that it had completed a relatively 
large project” but success in business should be based on actual performance of 
a commercially useful function.


Ways of encouraging recipients to break up contracts into smaller pieces that can 
more easily be performed by small businesses like DBEs, known as “unbundling.”

One of the inherent problems of the DBE rule from the transit vehicle manufacturer 
(TVM) perspective is that TVMs are required and expected to operate within rules 
better-suited for the construction side of transportation (e.g., building roads, 
bridges, tunnels, etc.).  Construction contracts by nature are more conducive to 
unbundling because there are not as many technical/engineering system 
integration requirements that essentially disqualify smaller companies in the TVM 
arena. In the passenger railcar industry, roughly 80% of the total materials are 
major components (e.g., propulsion, brakes, carshells, etc.)  It’s impractical and 
unrealistic, if not impossible, for recipients to unbundle many of a railcar’s major 
components.  For example, would the FTA expect a recipient’s engineer or 
program manager to unbundle its railcar HVAC unit so that the condenser is 
sourced out separately from the compressor while others bid on the metal 
fabrication or hardware or wiring – and then have others bid to build it? Would 
anyone buy an HVAC system for their own home in that manner?  Would it be 
cost-efficient?  

Many recipients require prime contractors to subcontract only to those major 
subsystem suppliers that are technically qualified to meet the recipient’s specific 
technical specifications (e.g., propulsion, auxiliary power, braking system, etc.). 
Generally, DBEs do not meet these major subsystem technical specifications. If 
you surveyed the 10 largest recipients and asked their program/project managers 
to send a list of their “technically approved” major system railcar component 
suppliers, you’d find very few, if any, DBEs on that list.  It’s not that DBEs aren’t 
capable of providing major components on a railcar – in fact, some already are 
and/or many more may be if given the opportunity.  However, in order to provide 
multi-million dollar major railcar components, a company’s sales level (i.e., 26.65 
term “gross receipts”) needed to offset the manufacturing costs (e.g., equipment, 
facilities, material, labor, engineering, etc.) would likely cause a DBE to lose its 
eligibility.  In other words, DBEs that build their business up to compete as a 
prime contractor are somewhat subsequently penalized by their success. 

A prime contractor’s ability to obtain second-tier DBE participation on the railcar 
major subsystems is limited by the amount they derive from non-DBE major 
system suppliers. If these non-DBE suppliers are single- or sole-source-listed by 
the recipient in the bid specification, the prime has no control over those suppliers’ 
level of second-tier DBE participation. Hence, many non-DBE major system 
suppliers offer minimal second-tier DBE participation, especially on a responsive 
approach contract. However, if there is more than one non-DBE supplier 
technically qualified by the recipient, the prime contractor should consider the 
potential subcontractor’s second-tier DBE participation as an important sub-bid 
evaluative criterion. 

Taking into account the limited DBE participation available on railcar major 
subsystems, prime contractors must maximize DBE participation through direct 
purchases from DBEs that provide supplies and services that are not within the 
major systems, such as metal fabrication, wire/cable and industrial hardware.  

Recipients can expand opportunities for DBEs another way.  Since all recipients 
now maintain a database of certified DBEs, they could cross-match the various 
workscopes contained within their bid specifications to each DBE’s NAICS 
Codes.  The recipient could “bulk e-mail” their bid specifications and a list of 
(anticipated) prime bidders to all cross-matched DBEs to bid upon (multiple) 
workscopes.  To illustrate this point, let’s presume metal fabrication, wire/cable, 
and industrial hardware are contained on all railcar bid specifications.  In this 
instance, a recipient issuing any railcar bid spec would automatically e-mail 
railcar bid specifications to any and all DBEs whose NAICS Codes correspond to 
metal fabrication, wire/cable, and industrial hardware.  Some TVMs and other 
prime bidders with a proactive DBE participation program are already utilizing this 
approach to enhance supplier diversity.

Contact unbundling should be done whenever and wherever practical.  The Mentor-
Protégé program could enhance contact unbundling in the railcar industry for 
everyone if the funding level increased and the administration/implementation was 
improved.  


Potential ways of improving the DBE application and personal new worth (PNW) 
forms.

There’s inconsistency in how recipients develop their PNW statements and 
interpret the financial data reported by DBE applicants. Some DBEs (and their 
accountants) find these forms both confusing and misleading.  If a DBE owner’s 
primary residence and the equity in their business doesn’t count toward their 
PNW, then some owners don’t understand why various recipients “dig deeper” 
than others into the DBE’s personal assets outside of their business. Instead of 
allowing recipients to (re)create additional burdensome and potentially intrusive 
documentation requirements, the DOT should standardize the PNW statement for 
all recipients or at least publish a “draft” version for industry comment via a future 
NPRM.

If any changes are made to what’s included/excluded in a DBE owner’s PNW, the 
owner’s equity should still remain excluded.  If a DBE owner’s primary residence 
is to be considered, the $750,000 cap must be raised.  Calculating ever-changing 
local real estate market values (e.g., a house in Buffalo is worth less than a 
similar house on Long Island) and/or cost of living adjustments may open up a 
never-ending debate.


Potential ways of improving program oversight.

Requiring prime contractors to report actual payments to DBEs, instead of the 
subcontract award amount, should keep everyone honest and accountable. The 
true value of any DBE program should always be measured by actual 
performance, not promises. The MARTA in Atlanta audits their prime contractors’ 
reported DBE supplier payments each quarter by directly contacting each “listed” 
DBE to verify the prime’s most recent and cumulative payments. 

Recipients have a choice between handling bidder compliance with contract goals 
as a matter of responsiveness (committing to specific DBE subcontractors “up-
front” in their bid submittals) or responsibility (committing to a DBE contract goal, 
but selecting DBE suppliers after the recipient has awarded the contract to the 
prime contractor). Many recipients prefer the responsiveness approach as a 
deterrent to bid-shopping while others believe the responsibility concept offers a 
more flexible and cost-effective approach. 

The DOT maintains that recipients should continue to use their own discretion on 
this issue.  However, my experience has shown that, on applicable DOT-assisted 
contract bid solicitations issued since the 1999 issuance of the Part 26 DBE rule, 
nearly all recipients have required prime contractors to abide by the 
responsiveness approach. In essence, this means guaranteeing all DBE 
subcontracts up front in their bid proposals through “DBE Letters of Intent.” 
Excerpts from Section 26.53 (b) reveal why recipients so consistently utilize the 
responsiveness approach in their bid solicitations: 
“In your solicitations for DOT-assisted contracts for which a contract goal has 
been established,…All bidders/offerors will be required to submit the following 
information to the recipient [recipient]…: (i)The names and addresses of DBE 
firms that will participate in the contract; (ii) A description of the work that each 
DBE will perform; (iii) The dollar amount of the participation of each DBE firm 
participating; (iv) Written documentation of the bidder/offeror's commitment to use 
a DBE subcontractor whose participation it submits to meet a contract goal; (v) 
Written confirmation from the DBE that it is participating in the contract as 
provided in the prime contractor's commitment;…”

Perhaps the reason the responsibility approach isn’t utilized by recipients is that 
this important option is (unintentionally) buried 12 paragraphs later in Section 
26.53 (e) which states:
“In a ‘design-build’ or ‘turnkey’ contracting situation, in which the recipient 
[recipient] lets a master contract to a [prime] contractor, who in turn lets 
subsequent subcontracts for the work of the project, a recipient may establish a 
goal for the project. The master contractor then establishes contract (DBE) goals, 
as appropriate, for the subcontracts it lets. Recipients must maintain oversight of 
the master contractor's activities to ensure that they are conducted consistent 
with the requirements of this part.”

These excerpts from the “Preamble” (or Background Information) section of the 
1999 issuance of the Part 26 DBE rule offer a good argument relevant to the 
railcar industry:
“…In a sense, the master contractor stands in the shoes of the recipient 
[recipient]. On design-build contracts, the normal process for setting contract 
goals does not fit the contract award process well. At the time of the award of the 
master contract, neither the recipient nor the master contractor knows in detail 
what the project will look like or exactly what contracting opportunities there will 
be, let alone the identity of DBEs who may subsequently be involved. In these 
situations, the recipient may alter the normal process, setting a project goal to 
which the master contractor commits. Later, when the master contractor is letting 
subcontracts, it will set contract goals as appropriate, standing in the shoes of the 
recipient…”

Some recipients prefer the responsiveness approach because some prime 
contractors commit to using specific DBEs in meeting their contractual goal and 
subsequently don’t honor their commitment (i.e., they don’t walk the talk). The 
solution is simple. Recipients should include in their contracts a financial penalty, 
equal (or greater) to the DBE shortfall amount, that the prime contractor must pay 
the recipient. Furthermore, the recipient must enforce this policy. 

Some recipients claim they prefer the responsiveness approach to avoid “bid 
shopping.” It is important to note the difference between bid shopping and 
competitive bidding. Bid shopping is when a prime contractor reveals the bid price 
of their potential DBE subcontractors to competing DBE subcontractors and 
requests that they beat the original price. This kind of bid shopping (DBE or non-
DBE) should never be allowed because it’s unethical to reveal proprietary 
information. However, allowing prime contractors to request competitive bids after 
the recipient has awarded the contract is not bid shopping - it’s capitalism. Since 
most recipients make awards to the lowest responsible bidder, it would make 
sense that prime contractors (if so compelled) should be able to use the same 
system to select their subcontractors, DBE or not.  Although some DBEs argue 
that this competition forces them to submit bid prices that are too low to provide 
them a reasonable profit margin, any business owner (DBE or not) must 
understand what constitutes a sensible, profitable bid. A DBE owner should be 
exposed to the same risks and rewards as any other entrepreneur. 

The practice of guaranteeing contracts with DBE firms prior to a contract award 
has been advocated in other business sectors, especially construction. In a fixed-
price construction bid, (when the design is substantially or totally defined and the 
contractor is dealing primarily with first-tier subcontractors whose scope of work 
can be determined based on that completed design), such a “lock-in” may make 
sense in order to assure achievement of a DBE goal. It’s widely acknowledged 
that the railcar industry differs from construction in that most DBE subcontracting 
opportunities are defined months and even years after a contract award. 
Recipients do not finalize many engineering designs until they have received and 
accepted the prime contractor's first prototype vehicle(s). A prime contractor’s 
ability to increase DBE participation is best-served when they’re entrusted with 
the responsibility for awarding DBE contracts throughout the duration of their 
multiyear contracts.  As an example, wire/cable assemblies are needed on a 
railcar remanufacturing project. How can a prime contractor or their potential major 
system suppliers guarantee up-front specific DBE names, workscopes, and 
dollars on a multi-year contract when the DBE wire/cable assembly firm won’t 
know the cost of copper six months hence?

A prime contractor’s procurement process is affected by provisions that 
encourage the use of second-tier DBE subcontractors, but that also require 
primes and their non-DBE major suppliers to obligate workscope and price to 
DBEs before the recipient’s award date. That, in effect, means that prime 
contractors and their non-DBE major system suppliers have almost no ability to 
adjust scope or price to conform to post-award approvals of neither major 
component specifications nor the prime contractor’s final executed purchase order 
with DBE suppliers. This subverts the normal relationship between contractor and 
subcontractor and places everyone, including the DBE, at risk of realistic 
adjustments to workscope and price.

When recipients require prime contractors to abide by the responsiveness 
approach, the few larger, well-established DBEs (who are capable of providing 
multiple subsystems) receive the lion’s share of the DBE subcontracts, effectively 
shutting out many up-and-coming DBEs who need more opportunities. When 
given the flexibility to select their DBE subcontractors throughout a contract’s 
duration, primes can often double the number of DBE participants. The overall 
contract DBE participation amount doesn’t necessarily increase (although it often 
does), but many more DBEs subsequently get a piece of the pie.

Prime contractors should be willing to contractually obligate themselves to an 
attainable DBE contract goal suggested by the recipient and should guarantee 
that level of DBE participation by certified DBE firms throughout the lifetime of the 
contract. The elimination of the requirement to obligate proposers to specific DBE 
firms for specific dollar amounts prior to contract award is in the best interest of all 
parties. DBEs participating in the bidding process throughout contract duration 
would be afforded more opportunity to compete and grow.


Potential ways of reducing burdens on firms seeking certification as DBEs in more 
than one state

My review of dozens of recipients’ DBE directories reveals no common format. 
Some directories sort alphabetically only by company name, others only 
numerically by NAICS code, and others only by workscope alphabetically (most 
useful of the 3). Even worse, many recipients will publish their DBE directories in 
only.pdf format or hard copy. This cumbersome format makes it impossible for 
anyone to sort and customize a list of potential DBEs that match their 
subcontracting needs.  The DOT should consider requiring all recipients to develop 
an on-line user-friendly DBE database similar to the NYSDOT’s that enables any 
user to sort and customize a potential DBE subcontractor list to meet their 
specific needs. 

Since out-of-state recipients aren’t required to accept an out-of-state DBE 
applicant’s home state certification, out-of-state DBE applicants often face 
unnecessary delays and unending requests for repetitive documentation.  Some 
recipients tell me they believe their own internal DBE application approval process 
is more thorough than an out-of-state DBE applicant’s home state recipient’s 
process and therefore they fear that the out-of-state applicant may have slipped 
through the path of least resistance.  If this is truly a concern, then perhaps the 
DOT should standardize a minimum set of application review procedures that all 
recipients must follow to insure no illegitimate applicants slip through the system.  
Since gathering 50 states’ worth of recipients’ DBE managers for discussion, 
resolution and training is unlikely, perhaps each of the 10 FTA Regional 
Administrators could work within their own geographic areas to standardize DBE 
application processing procedures.  

If you surveyed the larger recipients across the country and asked them to name 
the most thorough out-of-state recipients administering DBE certification, you’re 
likely to narrow it down to a short list.  The DOT could then observe the best 
recipients to see what makes them successful.   The New York MTA DBE 
certification process appears to be well-respected throughout at least the 
Northeast US (if not nationwide).  Although a “one state fits all (states)” scenario 
may be too large of a pill for recipients to swallow today, perhaps a DBE’s initial 
certification should be reciprocal within their FTA regional area for one year and 
then reciprocated on a national basis after 2 or 3 years. 

The recipient’s decision-making timeline in Section 26.83(k) is a major roadblock 
for DBE applicants because the 90-day “decision clock” never starts ticking 
until “receiving from the applicant firm all information required under this part.”  All 
information includes the recipient’s review of all of the DBE’s application 
documentation, the recipient’s “desk audit,” and the recipient’s on-site visit.  
DBEs sometimes wait several months waiting for recipients to schedule an on-site 
visit following their initial desk audit.  Recipients sometimes tell DBEs that, due to 
a lack of funding and/or travel authorization restrictions, the on-site visit is 
postponed until further notice.  In essence, the 90-day clock might not begin 
ticking until several months after a DBE submits their application.  Meanwhile, 
legitimate DBEs lose contracting opportunities because they lack certification.  
It’s a lose-lose Catch-22 because recipients will only count certified DBEs toward 
a bid/contact goal but recipients can’t/won’t certify pending DBE applicants before 
a bid due date.

Closing Statement

When you consider the transit industry’s ultimate customer base (the riders), 
minorities and women represent a significant portion, and perhaps a majority, of 
the market. It stands to reason that minorities and women should also be a 
significant part of the supplier base. Supplier diversity is a tremendous value to 
everyone and must succeed at every level.  DM2US thanks the DOT for their 
outstanding continuous efforts toward improving the DBE program and this 
opportunity to submit comments.

49 CFR Part 26

Docket No. OST-2009-0082

The Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) welcomes the opportunity to 
comment on the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) advance 
notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM), which seeks input on six issues of 
concern to participants in the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) 
Program.  MDOT has three modal administrations that participate in the DBE 
Program – the Maryland Aviation Administration, the Maryland Transit 
Administration and Maryland’s State Highway Administration.

1.  Counting or DBE credit for items obtained by DBE subcontractors from other 
sources, particularly the prime contractor for whom they are working (§ 26.55(a)(1))
 
If there are to be any changes to the current regulations, MDOT supports Option 2 
that leaves the basic structure of section 26.55(a)(1) intact but permits recipients 
to make exceptions based on criteria stated in an amendment to the regulation.  
MDOT supports Option 2 because it helps recipients (i) ensure that DBE credit is 
given only for contributions made by DBE firms, and (ii) avoid issues concerning 
whether a DBE is actually controlling and managing its work on a given project.  
Any regulatory change that maintains the separation between the work performed 
by the prime and the work performed by the DBE will facilitate the recipient’s 
ability to monitor the independence of DBE subcontractors.  If USDOT pursues 
Option 2, MDOT suggests the amendment include an exception that allows 
counting of proprietary items provided by prime contractors to DBE firms when 
those proprietary items are required under the terms of the bid documents.  (By 
proprietary item, we refer to those products or services manufactured or offered 
under exclusive rights of ownership, including rights under patent, copyright, or 
trade secret law.)  MDOT further suggests that the process for granting this 
exception include submission of a certification by the prime that the cost of these 
items is fair and reasonable.

2.  Contract Unbundling (race neutral measure under § 26.51(b)(1))

MDOT believes that unbundling of contracts for purposes of increasing DBE 
participation should be left to the discretion of each recipient because the 
contracting agencies are in the best position to determine what contracts are 
suitable for unbundling.  Thus, MDOT would not favor mandatory unbundling.  
Rather, MDOT would support the development of procedures to facilitate 
cooperation among small businesses and DBE firms (including the formation of 
joint ventures) to allow them to better compete for larger contracts.     

 3.  Certification Application (§ 26.83(c)(7)) and PNW Statement

Although MDOT is in favor of allowing DBE applicants to continue to provide their 
own version of a personal net worth (PNW) statement, we suggest that the DBE 
regulations discourage the use of SBA Form 413 and specify the required data in 
more detail.  It would be helpful if the PNW instructions described those items 
most often omitted or incorrectly listed, e.g. the value of the owner’s primary 
residence and the value of stock held in the applicant firm.  MDOT further supports 
asking applicants to submit W-2 “Wage and Tax” statements because that data 
can illuminate a key component of business operations – owner and employee 
remuneration.

4.  Program Oversight

MDOT would welcome USDOT guidance on strategies for enhanced compliance, 
enforcement, and oversight, and recommends comprehensive and routine training 
of recipients’ staff by USDOT experts.  A best practice for ensuring the integrity of 
the DBE program is to require certifiers to adhere to their respective state ethics 
laws and regulations. 

5.  Interstate Certification (§ 26.81(e) & (f))

As a co-creator of and participant in the MD/VA/DC reciprocity program, MDOT 
believes that interstate reciprocity reduces the burden on firms seeking multi-state 
certification and facilitates cooperation among recipients.  MDOT, however, does 
not support a regional or national “rebuttable presumption of eligibility” given the 
significant procedural and resource differences among recipients’ certifying 
offices.  MDOT also agrees that fraud and error are more likely to occur with 
nationwide certification, and feels strongly that, under any approach, recipients 
must be able to deny an application if the firm is, based on reasonable grounds, 
ineligible for certification.  Further, although MDOT is hesitant to rely on outdated 
on-site reviews, we believe fiscal realities would make periodic updates to on-site 
reviews impossible without the use of USDOT funds.  As an alternative, MDOT 
suggests that recipients under reciprocity programs retain the option of 
conducting their own “updated” on-site review when the original on-site is 
outdated.  

6.  Termination for convenience and substitution (§ 26.53(f)(1) & (2))
 
MDOT supports any limitations on a prime contractor’s ability to remove DBE 
firms for convenience.  MDOT believes the commitment to a particular DBE during 
the procurement process should be a meaningful commitment, and a prime 
contractor should not be allowed to alter or amend its initial affirmative action plan 
without the express consent of the contracting recipient.  USDOT guidelines for 
determining whether the circumstances support approval of the termination and/or 
substitution, including specific examples, would be helpful.

Docket No. OST-2009

ANPRM-COMMENTS DUE JULY 7, 2009

The comments below are suggestions on different methods that can be discussed 
further and potentially used to improve the DBE Program.  The methods are meant 
to assist in providing ideas that may help to lessen a lot of the ongoing 
administrative issues that continue to plague the DBE Program and cause 
unnecessary certification delays, incorrect certification/decertification decisions, 
varied interpretations on DBE program requirements, etc. 

1.	COUNTING OF DBE CREDIT FOR ITEMS OBTAINED BY DBE 
SUBCONTRACTORS FROM OTHER SOURCES, PARTICULARLY THE PRIME 
CONTRACTOR FOR WHOM THEY ARE WORKING ON A GIVEN CONTRACT; 
(no comment at this time)

2.	WAYS OF ENCOURAGING RECIPIENTS TO BREAK UP 
CONTRACTS INTO SMALLER PIECES THAT CAN MORE EASILY BE 
PERFORMED BY SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE DBES, KNOWN AS 
UNBUNDLING;

a.	WHAT STEPS DOT CAN TAKE TO FOSTER UNBUNDLING, 
ADVOCATE GREATER USE OF THE TECHNIQUE
i.	Ensure that when unbundling does occur, recipients DO NOT still 
place a goal as this has been happening with some of the unbundling that has 
taken place; Reiterate that not ALL contracts require, warrant, need a goal.
ii.	Require that each recipient unbundle the % of contracts equal to their 
annual goal; for example if their annual goal is 15% and they let out about 20 
contracts that year- then at least 3 MUST be small enough for small businesses 
to compete successfully; perform as a look ahead based on past year’s goal 
achievement (this is not a set-aside or quota as ALL interested firms, DBE and 
non-DBE, can bid on these smaller projects).
iii.	Recipients must show what proactive measures (specific details) they 
took during the year to ensure that there was DBE participation via race-neutral 
means in their Annual DBE Accomplishment reports (December-DBE/March-
ACDBE).
iv.	Recipients must give credit to Primes when they provide evidence that 
Primes unbundled contracts to attract small businesses 
v.	Provide a monetary incentive (more federal grant money?) to recipients 
who unbundled and achieve small business participation via those contracts; in 
alternative- recipients in a region vie for 1 federal grant that is awarded based on 
who achieved the highest DBE participation via unbundling.

3.	POTENTIAL WAYS OF IMPROVING THE DBE APPLICATION AND 
PERSONAL NETWORTH (PNW) FORMS;

a.	NATIONAL DATABASE FOR UCPs TO ACCESS. The database 
should include (1) firms certified as DBE and in which states certified; and (2) 
firms that have been decertified and reasons for decertification, (3) copies of site 
visit reports. The database should only be accessible by UCPs and no personal or 
financial information will be released unless DBE provides written consent. 
Ongoing Maintenance and cost of this may be an issue but perhaps is handled by 
all UCPs paying for a portion of it with additional federal aid? Or to be funded 
directly by DOT, or funding through application fees for multistate certification, or 
by fees charged to Primes for confirmation of a DBE’s certification.
i.	Nationalize only the PNW/Business Size Review by FAA/DOT in 
Washington, DC; a small fee can be assessed to each state to offset cost of 
CPAs, consultants, etc. This centralizes this piece of the certification process 
and allows states to continue to review other areas of application and local 
information and may help to decrease number of certification appeals to DOT and 
subjective/varied interpretations of PNW.
b.	Place UCP Application on FAA/DOT website or OSDBU and that is the 
ONLY place that applicant can obtain the application and submit to UCP; 
guarantees that the same application is used by all.

4.	POTENTIAL WAYS OF IMPROVING PROGRAM OVERSIGHT

a.	UCPs required to submit an annual audit report to FAA detailing the 
year in review of certification, decertification, mandatory on-going training/refresher 
course on certification for certifiers;
b.	Alternative FAA/DOT surprise audits and take a sampling of 
certifications/decertifications and review for consistency.
c.	Ongoing case file history on OSDBU website or FAA/DOT website that 
details actual cases (certifications/decertifications) what was the outcome
d.	DOT/FAA do an annual certification training every year; with breakout 
sessions specific to certain areas of interest (PNW- i.e. count of retirement); if 
cost is issue- do webinar.
e.	All certifiers should be required to take training and pass a test and 
achieve a certain grade to be able to be a certifier? FAA/DOT perform regional 
training sessions (4x a year)-required as mandatory for all UCPs and certification 
staff to attend.
f.	All applicants asked to send comments on the application process to 
DOT/FAA after certification decision made; no incentive to do so but those who do 
may provide ongoing insight on issues that need to be resolved with the process. 

5.	POTENTIAL WAYS OF REDUCING BURDENS ON FIRMS SEEKING 
CERTIFICATION AS DBEs IN MORE THAN ONE STATE

a.	NATIONAL DATABASE FOR UCPs TO ACCESS. The database 
should include (1) firms certified as DBE and in which states certified; and (2) 
firms that have been decertified and reasons for decertification, (3) copies of site 
visit reports. The database should only be accessible by UCPs and no personal or 
financial information will be released unless DBE provides written consent. 
Ongoing Maintenance and cost of this may be an issue but perhaps is handled by 
all UCPs paying for a portion of it with additional federal aid? Or to be funded 
directly by DOT, or funding through application fees for multistate certification, or 
by fees charged to Primes for confirmation of a DBE’s certification.
b.	Absolutely require a time-limit within which certifying entity MUST 
respond to new certifying entity seeking site visit report; (30 days).  This has been 
an ongoing issue for certified DBEs seeking certification in other states as original 
certifying entity has not always been timely in responding to new agency seeking 
site visit report. 
c.	All currently certified firms in one state seeking certification in another 
state MUST be put on a fast track (30 days or less) application process after 
showing proof of out of state certification and submittal of all documents within 
their power, and pending opportunity (LOI) (does not include site visit report to be 
submitted by certifying entity). 
i.	FAA/DOT maintains a database of all site visit reports only to be 
accessible by UCPs as needed.
d.	National Certification Reciprocity is acceptable if there is National 
Certification Training that is mandatory of all certifiers otherwise issues regarding 
Forum Shopping etc will happen.
e.	Split entire U.S. into 8 regions and require that states that fall in those 
regions form a Regional UCP and that they have a mandate on how certification is 
to be handled; this mandate should be uniform for all 8 regions and 
reviewed/approved by FAA/DOT- Appoint a Regional UCP Director for each region 
from FAA/DOT who should receive annual/quarterly reports on Regional UCP’s 
program.

options that would allow recipients to count supplies purchased from or equipment 
leased from prime contractors.  Based on experience monitoring projects, D. 
Wilson Consulting Group strongly believes that this rule should not be changed.  
An example of a the abuse that could and probably will occur if this rule is 
removed actually occurred on a project that D. Wilson was a participant.  A DBE 
purchased a large piece of machinery (a truck) that the DBE never saw nor used.  
At the end of the project, the prime contractor was going to “buy” the truck back 
from the DBE for $1.  We have seen examples of DBEs leasing equipment from 
prime contractors; however, the DBE never conducted work on the leased 
equipment.  We strongly urge DOT not to change the language in section 26.55(a)
(1).

 

We believe that methods to encourage unbundling would be beneficial for the DBE 
program.  Recently, in Colorado, CDOT gave scoring points on a design-build 
contract to proposers for unbundling parts of its project so that small businesses 
could have more of a chance to bid on large projects.  Therefore, we encourage 
DOT to add unbundling as an incentive—not as a requirement.

to the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program.  Ohio would like to comment 
on Issue 1 - Counting Credit for Items Obtained by DBEs from Non-DBE Sources.

As noted in the supplementary information, the Ohio Department of Transportation 
requested a waiver of Section 26.55 in 2007 in order to recognize a long-standing 
practice among DBE firms in Ohio.  At that time, Ohio had a policy of allowing 
prime contrators to count DBE participation achieved from asphalt purchased by 
the DBE from the prime contractor's or its affiliate's asphalt plants. This policy 
reflected the market conditions in Ohio wherein ownership of asphalt companies 
had been condensed to a few select companies.  This coupled with the fact that 
Ohio's Construction and Material Specifications prohibited the hauling of hot mix 
from a distance greater tha 50 miles created a unique situation in Ohio where it 
was almost impossible for the DBE to submit a bid.  While Ohio recognized that 
the purpose of the exclusion of supplies and equipment purchased or leased from 
the prime contractor was to ensure that the DBE firm was independent and 
performing a commercially useful function (CUF), we believed that there were 
safeguards that could have been implemented to assure the Department that the 
DBE firm was actually responsible for negotiating price, determining quality and 
quantity, ordering material and installing and paying for material itself.

Ohio is pleased that the Department is now seeking comments on four potential 
options which attempt to address some of Ohio's and other stakeholder's 
concerns.  Ohio supports Option 3 which permits items obtained by DBEs to be 
counted regardless of the source.  This option provides a level playing field for all 
DBE firms in purchasing supplies and equipment, especially asphalt, and would 
allow the DBE firms to operate in a normal industry fashion.  Also, this option is 
consistent with the intent of the DBE program to provide a competitive playing field 
for DBE firms; it eliminates intentional inconsistencies in the program; and allows 
transportation departments the flexibility to adapt to marktet conditions within their 
own state.

Thank you again for the opportunity to comment.",,,,,,,

Claitt, Director",,,,,"The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) - DBE Program 
Office offers the following comments on five of the items being addressed in this 
ANPRM.

Item 1:	Counting Credit for Items Obtained by DBEs from Non-DBE Sources

Comment:	Option 1:  No change.  Leave the language of section 26.55(a)(1) as it 
is.


Item 2:	Contract Unbundling

Comment:	Over the past two – three years, our agency has seen an increase in 
the number of DBE contractors bidding on smaller contracts, and being 
successful as prime contractors.  It is our belief that some of these firms may be 
excellent candidates for joint venturing. Therefore, the suggestion with the most 
merit for advocating the inclusion of small and disadvantaged businesses in larger 
federal contracting opportunities would be to facilitate DBE “joint venturing”.  Joint 
venturing could be included as a business development strategy within the 
recipient’s DBE Program. This concept would have to be promoted through 
collaboration between recipients, minority and women business organizations, 
minority business chambers, and small business development agencies.  
However, persuading DBEs that joint venturing is a viable means to business 
growth may not be readily acceptable to many small business owners, unless 
advocated through the respective organization/agency memberships.   Addressing 
the fears and apprehensions of DBEs to take this next step could be a major 
obstacle.  The focus would have to be those DBEs who are established 
businesses, have successfully participated in the DBE Program in a 
subcontracting capacity, or have participated as a prime contractor on small 
contracts.  Communication, education, and technical support, together with 
conducting thorough capability assessments, would be key components to the 
formation and success of joint ventures among DBEs.


Item 3:	Revised DBE Certification Application and Personal Net Worth 
Statement

Comment:	We offer the following suggestions:
a) The regulations should clarify whether or not a firm must be in business for a 
certain period of time (e.g., at least two (2) years) prior to applying for DBE 
certification vs. the current regulation which states, in part, “Nor must you refuse 
to certify a firm solely on the basis that it is a newly formed firm.”

b) Section 1: Certification Information, Part A. Prior/Other Certifications - Require 
that the application be completed in its entirety regardless of whether the firm is 8
(a) or SDB certified.  Clarification is required on the Memorandum of 
Understanding between the U.S. DOT and the SBA.  If a firm is 8(a) certified, they 
should be certified as a DBE on a reciprocal basis; no additional certification 
application should be required.  Also, the reference to SDB certification should be 
removed since SDB certification does not follow the same strict requirements of 
the 8(a) and DBE Programs. 

c) We agree that the certification application should include more details 
concerning owners’ outside employment or other business dealings to include a 
description of the time spent at these operations and an explanation of how these 
activities do not conflict with their ability to manage the applicant firm.

d) The certification application should include a section for the applicant firm to 
provide the NAICS codes associated with their business.

e) Amend the Supporting Documents Checklist to separate the requirements for 
Corporations and LLCs – i.e., two separate sections.

f) Personal Net Worth Statement:
     1. It should be mandatory that the disadvantaged individual(s) include the 
information for their personal residence on the statement.
     2. Provide examples of “Personal Property” to assist applicants in completing 
this section and ensuring they disclose pertinent information.

g) Personal / Corporate Tax Returns – specify that the tax returns submitted must 
be all inclusive (i.e., all schedules; W2 forms; etc.) and must either be signed or 
be accompanied by an electronic submission receipt.


Item 5:	Facilitating Interstate Certification

Comment:	We support interstate certification, as well as nationwide reciprocity, 
with the stipulation that the Federal government take the lead and oversee the 
process.  A few recommendations would be:

     a) The reassessment date should be the same for firms certified on a 
reciprocal basis.  For example, a firm is certified in State A and applies to State 
B.  When State B reviews and certifies the firm, the firm’s reassessment date for 
State B should be the same as State A’s reassessment date.

    b) It should be a requirement that on-site reviews be conducted at certain 
intervals (e.g., every six years), or when a firm relocates its primary business 
location.


Item 6:	Terminations for Convenience and Substitution

Comment:	SEPTA currently requires prime contractors to submit a request for 
termination/substitution to include a thorough explanation of the reason for their 
request.  We require that they include with their request the substitute DBE firm
(s) that will now be participating, or their good faith efforts in meeting the contract 
goal.  The prime contractor must receive our approval prior to implementing any 
changes.  Additionally, if a prime contractor is issued a change order in the area 
of work on which a DBE is currently participating, and the DBE is still on-site, that 
DBE should participate in the change order.

Being mentally ill with my service animal I am required to give proof and required to warn them of my flying because I am mentally ill and use a service animal.

How can DOT's reasoning have anything to do with this being because of invisible disabilities because the mentally ill are the only ones required to give proof of disability and warning before flying!  Other invisibly disabled folks who might be seen using service animals are among folks who suffer from hearing loss, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, sleeping disorders, chronic pain, Multiple Sclerosis, and epilepsy.  

I ask why is this ruling named ""Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel"" when DOT has obviously created a separate list of rules for the mentally ill.  This is specific discrimination based on type of disability.  It if offensive and is just wrong!!!

Are people who use wheel chairs required to provide ""proof"" of disability prior to using a ramp or a lift?  I think not because it would be wrong!

The only difference I see is discrimination against the mentally ill in a ""Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel"" Ruling!

I believe it is fair to require documentation so that people can fly with Emotional Support Animals, as they are not Service Animals and need not be highly trained. However, users of Service Animals should not be required to submit documentation or to give advance notice before travel. 

Almost all types of Service Animals can be, and often are, trained by their owners. Just as some psychiatric Service Animals are trained by professional programs.

If there are some issues with non disabled passengers falsely claiming their pets are Service Animals, then surely that is happening across the board. They will be claiming their animals as any type of Service Animal that assists with any type of invisible disability that Service Animals are typically used for, such as diabetic alerts or seizure alerts. I don't believe non disabled people who want to pretend their pet is a Service Animal will be choosing to pretend to have mental illness when there is any number of other invisible disabilities they could be pretending to suffer from. Yet, users of diabetic alert Service Animals and seizure alert Service Animals are not required to provide private medical documentation or advance notice of travel.

Users of all types of Service Animals should be treated equitably. It does not make sense to single out people who use Service Animals for psychiatric disabilities and place extra requirements on them. Either all users of Service Animals should be required to provide documentation and give advance notice of travel, or none should be required to do so. There should be no distinction due to the type of disability. Drawing a distinction because of the nature of a person's disability is discriminatory.

Please revoke the discriminatory rules that require documentation and advance notice of travel from users of psychiatric Service Animals.",,,,,,,

It is after all discriminatory since you've chosen to single out an entire category of the disabled to certify their disability down to a letter of documentation from their medical provider in advance of their travel.  The only way to make this right is to require this of all service dog users or of no service dog users.  After all, Emotional Support Animals, by law, are NOT service animals.  They don't have the training to do work or tasks to mitigate their handler's disability or even the requirement of basic public access manners. 

If your fear is ""fakers"", what makes you think they'd all be hiding amongst the users of emotional support animals and psychiatric service dogs?  Now that letters of documentation are required of these two groups, if ""fakers"" are a problem, they'll just move along to another class of invisible disability that doesn't require all the documentation such as medical alert.  So I really don't even see a point in the requirement for documentation from users of psychiatric service dogs - since after all a psychiatric service dog IS a service dog and NOT an emotional support animal.  If fakers are the problem, wouldn't it be better to institute a penalty for getting an animal into the passenger area that's not really a service animal instead of penalizing and discriminating against an entire class of the disabled?",,,,,,,

My psychiatric service dog has been specifically trained to recognize signs of a panic attack or bipolar mood swing. He is trained to alert me, and to ground me with deep pressure therapy and tactile stimulation until the episode passes, or until I can get to a place where I can take my ""rescue"" medications, which cause me to sleep for four hours. Using a service dog I need my ""rescue"" medications every 1-2 weeks. Before, I was using these medications daily. 

The last time I flew before having a psychiatric service dog, I fainted twice due to extreme anxiety, requiring medical assistance and oxygen, and nearly causing the plane to divert to another airport to let me deplane. Use of my service dog in the cabin has enabled me to fly without issue ten times since then.

A psychiatric service dog is very different from an emotional support animal. A psychiatric service dog has been trained to do work to mitigate the handler's disability, and to behave in public. Emotional support animals are not specifically trained to do these things. They are a class of pet that DOT has granted special access to. It takes 1-2 years to train a psychiatric service dog to mitigate the handler's disability and to behave in public. Your average emotional support animal has had as much (or little) training as your average pet.

The changes to the ACAA require psychiatric service animals (and only this type of service animal) to provide advanced notice and documentation. No other type of service animal is required to do these things. Additionally, these changes lump psychiatric service animals with emotional support animals. Emotional support animals are pets, psychiatric service animals are not. 

The purpose of the ACAA is to ensure nondiscrimination in air travel. Requiring people with one type of disability using a service animal to provide additional documentation, whereas no person with another type of service animal must provide it, is extremely discriminatory!",,,,,,,

DOT enacted changes over worries people might fraudulently represent pets as psychiatric service animals, but it is just as easy to 'fake' a service animal that alerts to seizures or diabetes. Some people even purchase a guide harness to pass their pet off as a guide dog! Requiring notice and documentation for one class of service animal will encourage fraudulent activity for other types of service animals.

I encourage DOT to adopt measures other than documentation to weed out 'fake' service animals. The ADA provides two questions that can be asked to determine legitimacy (1) Is this service animal required because of a disability? 2) What type of assistance does this animal perform?). If an animal is disruptive or destructive, no matter if it is a service animal or not, it can legally be forced to leave:

DOT can ask these or similar questions for “credible verbal assurance”. Although not required by the ADA, DOT might require markings indicating service animal status (eg vest, service harness, leash slide, bandana, markings on a collar, etc).

I suggest DOT implement punishments for fraudulent service animal activity. If a person has fraudulently claimed a pet as a service animal, they should be refused service from that airline in the future (regardless of whether they have the animal with them). If the animal is disruptive or destructive during the flight, the passenger and animal can be forced to deplane, and/or refused their return flight while they have the animal accompanying them. Fines or jail time for fraudulent service animal activity could be implemented.

I support the Psychiatric Service Dog Society's positions. I urge DOT to be nondiscriminatory, and to outline questions that can be asked to provide ""credible verbal assurance"". I encourage DOT to provide consequences for fraudulent service animal activity. As to emotional support animals (pets), either DOT should require documentation, or they should exclude them from in-cabin air travel.",,,,,,,

So it should not be surprising that there may be some overlap of the services provided by emotional support animals and service animals.   Some of the services listed in the previous answer require less training than others, and some gifted animals may be able to perform a couple of them naturally (without specific training).  So we should expect that there are some emotional support animals that can, without training, provide some of the same services a service animal can.  However, by definition none of an emotional support animal's disability-mitigating services are trained, and they will usually not exhibit any disability-mitigating behaviors that normally require training.  In contrast, an animal that is both trained to do work or tasks to mitigate a disability of its handler, and trained to behave properly in public (not just during air travel), is a service animal.  A service animal may perform a whole host of services that emotional support animals can't, especially the ones that require intensive training.

Psychiatric service animals already belong to a protected class of animals (service animals), about which there has been no question as to the nature of their unimpeded access to travel.  If the DOT decides to allow another class of animals similar access to air travel (emotional support animals), that should not impugn the integrity of psychiatric service animals.  Take the prior example of the gifted,  untrained pet that is able to perform a disability-mitigating service for its mobility-impaired handler.  This doesn't make us think we should treat that pet the same as a service animal, even if the pet is able to behave properly during air travel.  Neither should it make us think that a mobility-assistance service animal should be treated with more suspicion than other service animals, even if the DOT were to allow the untrained pet to travel like it does emotional support animals.",,,,,,,

The difference between emotional support animals and psychiatric service animals is in whether the animal is trained both to do work or tasks to mitigate the handler's life-limiting disability, and to behave properly in public.  DOT members should consider the following hypothetical situation.  Some pets of handlers with non-psychiatric life-limiting disabilities are not trained as service animals (both to do work or tasks to mitigate the handler's life-limiting psychiatric disability, and to behave properly in public), yet those pets are able to perform some of the same disability-mitigating services for their handlers as service animals could.  Imagine that these animals are allowed to travel with their handlers, just like emotional support animals do now.  What would be the basis for treating these animals differently than their service animal counterparts?  There is a strict analogy between this situation and that of emotional support animals and psychiatric service animals, so the principles used to answer the latter question should be the same as those used to answer the question to which this responds (about what would support different treatment for the groups in air travel).",,,,,,,

8. “The Department notes that the ACAA is a separate statute from the ADA. The ACAA is a specialized statute dealing only with transportation by air, in an environment in which a large number of people are confined within a limited space for what may be a prolonged period of time. The Department has long taken the position that accommodations for persons with disabilities, and DOT 
requirements for them, may justifiably differ between the air travel context and other contexts, such as places of public accommodation regulated by the Department of Justice under its ADA regulations. We seek comment on the application of this principle in the matter of PSAs and ESAs.”
/__________/
It is true that requirements for accommodations for persons with disabilities may justifiably differ between air travel and other contexts.  However, the differences should be limited to practical considerations, such as aisle width, restroom size, threshold height, etc.  The same ethical principles of non-discrimination should not be thrown out the window.  License for accommodation requirements to differ is not license to start from scratch with a new set of principles about which kinds of disabilities deserve external barriers to travel and which don't.  I encourage revisers of the ACAA to keep this in mind when considering whether certain revisions are acceptable, and moreover whether they are best in keeping with the principles that are intended to drive both the ADA and the ACAA.",,,,,,,

  Indeed, how would you feel if you were told ‘you can’t practice law, or secure a job at any airline facility because of your cognitive disability that requires you to have a service dog (or anyone with any type of disability at that).’
  This clearly illustrates discrimination, simply validating a sense of irrational reasoning of unprofessionalism that teeters on ignorance at its worst.
  I am the founder of a service dog self-help program that has won many prestigious awards. The training that goes into service dogs is astronomical. As throughout the years I came to realize that, regardless the disability, they don’t come in a “Fun-kit.” It takes a tremendous amount of hours, months and energy to get through such training.
  Please, I beg of you to listen to what you are demanding of the mentally ill. The fear and anxiety alone can set them back years, placing them at-risk of hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Leading them on a possible path of self-destruction and/or mutilation.

Emotional support animals may happen to be trained to behave properly in public settings, but are not by legal definition required to be trained.  An emotional support animal may, as a result of training or not, behave properly during airline travel.

The services a psychiatric service animal may provide are many and may be highly specific to the individual in question.  They may include alerting to panic attacks, reminding the handler to take medicine, orienting and grounding the handler via tactile stimulation, breaking dissociative episodes through tactile stimulation, leading the handler to a safe place during a post-traumatic stress disorder flashback, breaking obsessive-compulsive behaviors, providing tactile stimulation during severe major depressive episodes to encourage the release of mood-elevating hormones, waking up a hypersomniacal handler, etc.  Just as psychiatric disabilities may be highly individualized, so is which services the handler might require during air travel or at the destination—any one of the services listed might be needed during these times.",,,,,,,

Some individuals with mobility-related disabilities will specifically train service animals to help them keep their balance.  This does not mean that other people with the same mobility impairments automatically have service animals if they use a pet to steady themselves.  Service animals are trained to do specific jobs, whereas some pets may happen to do some of the same jobs without training for those jobs or training for full public access.  If those untrained pets perform a service that helps mitigate the handler's disability, and that disability is emotional in nature, they are known as emotional support animals.

While there may be a great disparity between the services an emotional support animal and a service animal may hypothetically provide, it is conceivable for there to be two animals that perform the same services, yet one is an emotional support animal and the other is a service animal.  There may be an extremely gifted animal that performs disability-mitigating services with no training, and a less gifted animal that has been specifically trained to perform those same services for a disabled handler.  This kind of situation could occur with a pet and a mobility-assistance service animal, respectively (or with a diabetes-alert service animal, or a seizure-alert service animal, etc.).  That would not cause us to think an individual with a mobility-assistance service animal should be allowed worse treatment when flying, just because there could be a talented pet that can help its owner in the same way without training.
/__________/
The question just isn't looking in the right direction (“how do these services [that a psychiatric service animal provides] differ from those that would be provided by an ESA during a flight or at the passenger’s destination?”).  This question makes it seem as if, were there no difference between the services performed by two individuals of the types in question, the status of a psychiatric service animal would be demoted.  Comparing services misses the forest for the trees.

I cannot directly answer this question, but I can provide some guidance in thinking about how to answer it.  As I mentioned before, it is conceivable that there could be a psychiatric service animal and an emotional support animal that perform the same types of services for their handlers.  It is just as conceivable that a gifted, untrained pet could perform the same services for a handler with a balance-related disability (or a seizure-related disability, or a diabetes-related disability) as those that particular service animals could perform.  Here I repeat for emphasis:  the place to look is not at the overlap between the services that both types of animals can perform.

6. “We note that over the years, many individuals who travel with ESAs have stated that their service animals, in addition to being trained to behave properly in public settings and providing needed emotional/mental health support without which they cannot travel, do in fact perform specific physical tasks related, for example, helping lessen anxiety in stressful situations.”
/__________/
There is some confusion in this statement.  Emotional support animals are not service animals and vice versa, so anyone who claimed their animal was both an emotional support animal and a service animal could be correct about at most one of these classifications.  Of course, it is unclear whether the “many individuals” actually claimed their animals were simultaneously emotional support animals and service animals, or whether the animals were just assumed to be either emotional support animals or service animals by the reporting sources.  We simply cannot tell based on the information given.

More specifically, it is unclear whether any animal described in the manner quoted above is a service animal.  The description given is incomplete.  Whether the animal described is a service animal depends on its being trained both to do work or tasks to mitigate the handler's life-limiting disability, and to behave properly in public.  If an animal is “trained to behave properly in public settings and [provides] needed emotional/mental health support without which they cannot travel, [and does] in fact perform specific physical tasks related, for example, [to] helping lessen anxiety in stressful situations”, then we do not know whether the animal has been specifically trained to do those physical tasks or provide that support.  If the animal has not been specifically trained to do these things, the animal is technically an emotional support animal.  If the animal has been specifically trained to do these things, the animal is a service animal.
/__________/
Some individuals are not adept at expressing themselves accurately in interpersonal communication, and others are not adept at learning exactly what the distinctions are between emotional support animals and (psychiatric) service animals.  Given these variations in people, and especially considering the conflation of these terms in the recent ACAA revisions, it is understandable that even legitimate service dog handlers and emotional support dog handlers can come across as confused in their expression of their animals' status.",,,,,,,

If the situation described in the question is one in which, in the very same situation, an individual claims an animal both as an emotional support animal and as a psychiatric service animal, such an individual either surely suffers from the confusion I describe in my last response above, or the individual is committing fraud.
/__________/
On the other hand, this question may also address a situation in which an individual flew with an animal as an emotional support animal, but at a later date flew with that same animal as a psychiatric service animal.  It should be noted that this by itself is not evidence of fraudulent activity.  A service animal still in training to become a psychiatric service animal may easily qualify as an emotional support animal, and later may be a genuine psychiatric service animal.  Also, a handler may at one time have an emotional support animal, not intending for it to become a service animal, and later life events may lead to that same animal being trained as a psychiatric service animal by the handler.",,,,,,,

As a disabled vet being treated for PTSD/TBI and numerous not so apparent physical issues and have a service dog to assist me. I honestly find it really hard to believe that the airlines are having issues in determining if someone is faking the need to have a service dog. I have had a hard enough time getting through airline security before I had the dog, put on no fly lists etc. I can not believe that the airlines are unable screen people if made to sign a form or state in a manner that CLEARLY reminds the handler that it is already federally (and some states) punishable offense to impersonate a service animal with fines seen as high as $20,000. And if they are faking there is now a record of this and can be prosecuted even after they are no longer passenger. 

I only say this as my injuries are unseen and if I leave my house without labeling my dog as a service animal via a huge collar and service dog vest I am challenged at every door and aisle – even though this is not required. As it is, I am often challenged by customers in a hyper critical way. It would be surprising to see someone put up with the verbal abuse and nitpicking that people provide me on a daily basis, let alone get stuck at an airport potentially for days on end having to deal with them and the security processes already there to just have a untrained pet with them.

The stress for me is already overwhelming enough that I prefer to drive from Michigan to Seattle for regular VA dr appnts. I have driven about 65,000 miles this year avoiding the airport and the uncertainty and inconsistency of how airports handle service animals and disabilities let alone me. It was hard enough before with the no fly lists and “yep this is allowed” and then land and go through security again and get the “no thats not allowed” randomness.

With that said, I fully agree with the Psychiatric Service Dog Society and if needed I would be happy to answer any questions.

I've been spending time recently talking with the Psychiatric Service Dog Society with an issue near and dear to my heart.  I am hoping that you will read this email, and stop discrimination against psychiatric service animals in air travel. People with psychiatric service animals (and only people with that type of  service animal) must provide 48 hrs notice and a letter detailing our mental illness in order to fly with our psychiatric service animals.  This IS discrimination! People with all other types of service animals do not have to provide any notice or documentation.This means that in order to fly, a person using a psychiatric service dog must visit their psychiatrist at least a month before the flight to obtain such a letter. This also means that in case of an emergency in the family, I would not be able to take the first flight home.  I would have to wait a minimum of 48 hours in order to fly anywhere (if I already had the letter on hand), or else I would not be able to bring my psychiatric service dog.  Remember only people with psychiatric service dogs have to provide the letter and 48 hrs notice, all other types of service dogs can fly with no notice and no letter.The reason the DOT has enacted these changes is that they are worried people might fraudulently represent pets as psychiatric service animals in order for them to fly.  This is not a valid concern, however, as it is just as easy to ""fake"" a service animal that assists with hearing impairments, alerts to seizures, alerts to diabetic shock, alerts to chemical sensitivities etc.  I have even known people to purchase large dark sunglasses and pass their pets off as guide dogs, or rent wheelchairs to pass pets off as mobility assistance dogs!  Requiring 48 hours notice and a detailed letter containing PRIVATE medical information for only one class of service animal will simply encourage fraudulent activity with other types of service animals instead. PLEASE don't let the discrimination go on!",,,,,,,

I won't speak as to airline policies, but the distinction between psychiatric service animals and emotional support animals is clear.  Psychiatric service animals are specifically trained both to do work or tasks to mitigate the handler's life-limiting psychiatric disability, and to behave properly in public.  Emotional support animals are not specifically trained both to do work or tasks to mitigate the handler's life-limiting psychiatric disability, and to behave properly in public.

It is difficult to train a dog to alert to a medical condition that is classified as ""psychiatric.""

As I am preparing my service dog in training to respond/alert to the onset of these symptoms, I'm hoping that will allow me to fly to distant places to visit family, etc.  I do have a letter from my doctor specifically prescribing my service dog for what he treats as a both a medical and psychiatric disability.  Because it is bio-chemical in nature, it is both.  It's severity prevents me from working.  While medication addresses much of the biochemistry, it does not prevent dangerous flare-ups.

SVILC wishes to offer comments on the new rules affecting people with psychiatric disabilities who use service animals.

The new rules single out people who use service animals for a psychiatric disability as opposed to another type of disability. This is not permitted under the Air Carrier Access Act, which states that an air carrier may not discriminate on the basis of physical or mental impairment. 49 USC 41705 (a) (1).

The references in the new rules to emotional support animals (ESAs) are spurious. Service animals, including psychiatric service animals, are rigorously trained to assist people with disabilities with specific tasks, in specific situations such as on an airplane flight. Thus, there is no reason to treat a service animal differently based solely on what type of disability its human partner has – and thus, to discriminate against the person based on that disability.

The Senate recently passed the Service Dogs for Veterans Act. Sponsored by Sens. Al Franken (D-MN) and Johnny Isakson (R-GA), the act will provide at least 200 service dogs to disabled veterans, half of whom will be veterans with psychiatric disabilities such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Under the new rules, airlines are free to impose onerous, discriminatory requirements on these veterans when bringing their new service dogs onto flights. Bear in mind that flying can be a particularly traumatic experience for veterans who have seen air combat. 

From the Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 to the Service Dogs for Veterans Act of 2009, Congress has clearly recognized the importance of service animals for all people with disabilities, including psychiatric disabilities. We ask that the Department of Transportation do the same.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2009-0093-0042/attachment_1.doc",

If the regulations requiring a letter from the patient's physician are eliminated, than all customers that want to transport their animals with them on vacation could simply state to airline personnel that they are emotional support animals. This could potentially cause many more animals to be transported leading to other areas of concern such as other passengers being allergic to animals. Currently, those passengers can simply be moved away from the animal but if there are substantially more animals on board this would become an issue and inconvenience others.

PSAs and ESAs  provide a valuable service to the disabled and should be treated the same as any other service animal.  To be singled out on the claim that some people are claiming pets as service animals is as wrong as racial profiling.  The animals behavior, not a persons type of disability or type of service animal, is the key.
It is my belief that if an individual is disabled for any reason, and claims that an animal is a service animal in accordance with the ADA, airlines need to accept this on faith unless the animal misbehaves.  If the animal does not meet minimum standards of behavior the airline can refuse to allow the animal in the cabin.  Since passengers spend time in the terminal and aircraft before leaving the gate, the airline staff can observe animals for problem behavior. 
As long as there are rules there will be people trying to cheat.  No system to stop fraud is perfect.  Discrimination against the mentally ill or others with service animals is not the way to stop fraud. 
Service animals can be an important tool for the mentally ill, and the services they perform vary widely.  Just having the animal present when symptoms occur, like an ESA, can be a significant help to some. 
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not require specific training, certification or identification, but does requires a minimum level of behavior standards for the service animal. Businesses are prohibited from treating disabled individuals with service animals less favorably than other patrons.  The new rules also appear to be in conflict with the intent of the ADA as well as the ACAA nondiscrimination policy.",,,,,,,

I believe that all types of service animals must be thoroughly trained and respectful of other passengers, and that poorly behaved animals of any type may be asked to leave.  A psychiatric service animal is different from an emotional support animal.  Unlike pets or emotional support animals, psychiatric service animals have been extensively trained to assist with specific medical symptoms and to behave in public places.  I fly frequently, and I have never been inconvenienced in any way by a service animal. 

I believe the DOT should recognize that fraudulent activities can occur with any form of assistance for the disabled.  Regardless of the type of assistance, it is still better to risk a few ""bad apples"" than to discriminate against an entire class of disability.

This is the first part of a three-part comment, the whole of which I have submitted in pdf form with this first post.  In this comment I address the consequences of the DOT policy, as found in the current version of the ACAA, for those with disabilities and those who abuse the system designed to make unfettered travel easier for those with disabilities.  The scope of what follows is only intended to include service animal issues.  I therefore do not directly address emotional support animals (a category of pet).  I focus on the kind of fraud in which an individual without a disability feigns a disability to get a pet on the plane, not fraud in which someone with a legitimate disability falsely claims a pet as a service animal.
/__________/
Many kinds of disabilities are susceptible to fraud.  Many of these disabilities, when genuine, are conditions for which the use of a service animal can be appropriate.  Let's assume for the sake of argument that one kind of disability (we'll call it 'disability A') is preferentially counterfeited over other disabilities, in order to bring a pet onboard an aircraft.  (Note that there is no strong, publicly clear evidential support that there is a preferentially feigned disability.)
/__________/
If the ACAA requires documentation and notice only for disability A, the results are twofold.  First, those who have disability A are discriminated against, having more external barriers to free movement than both those with other disabilities, and those without disabilities.  Second, it is likely that the same people who were faking disability A to get their pets onboard will then fake different disabilities.  The consequence is that the abuse is merely spread to other categories of disabilities, without a significant drop in the total number of abuses.

/_____/
If fraudulent service animal activity is stopped for disability A, but spreads to other categories of disabilities, one of only two possibilities could follow.  The first is that there is no longer a kind of disability that is faked more than others.  In this situation, it seems that the DOT would not take action against people with disabilities other than disability A, since the DOT strategy has been to single out the group perceived as the largest threat.  (I will consider the possibility of uniform DOT treatment below.)  So the result of this first possibility is that people with disability A are discriminated against, while the total amount of faking does not decrease.
/_____/
The second possibility is that there is another, new kind of disability that stands out as a preferentially faked category.  If this happens, the DOT indicates it would take action similar to that originally taken against fraud involving disability A (“Should the Department encounter a pattern of abuse concerning service animals in other categories, we can consider additional safeguards with respect to those categories as well.” -Federal Register, 47903).  Such further action would again discriminate against people with a particular kind of disability, and again, forces frauds to choose from among the many remaining kinds of disabilities they can counterfeit.  So with the second of only two possibilities, the result is that the total amount of fraud does not significantly decrease, while the amount of discrimination and external hardship faced by those with select kinds of disabilities increases.
/_____/
The consequences of the only two possibilities that can result from the current DOT strategy show something infuriating, disheartening, and most importantly, unjust.  The DOT has set itself up to promote systematic discrimination, with possibly increasing frequency, while the total amount of the very abuse that concerns its members remains the same.

/__________/
This evaluation draws out the unreasonableness of what is implicitly a “whack-a-mole” strategy—there are just too many holes the moles can pop out of (disabilities the frauds can feign).  This leaves us with two more reasonable strategies to consider.  Either apply the same hardships to all persons with disabilities, or apply them to none of them.
/__________/
Creating barriers to free movement for those with disabilities, barriers not erected against those without disabilities, is much less than ideal.  This action would punish many who already have severe difficulties with which they must deal, while preventing the transgressions of a few.  It does not seem likely that a proper cost-benefit analysis would favor such discrimination, and it is hasty to enact policies that discriminate without appropriate study as to their consequences, positive and negative.
/__________/
Applying these considerations, the best course of action is to immediately eliminate the rule that discriminates against those with psychiatric service animals.  My hope is that members of the DOT are at least able to approximate this action.  If, however, members of the DOT feel that some policy that makes it harder for those with service animals to travel is appropriate, a full study should be done of the policy's major consequences, and this should be done *before* that policy is put in place.

Addendum:  To be perfectly clear, I have expressed no opinion in this comment regarding whether emotional support animals (which are pets) should be allowed in-cabin, or whether their handlers should be required to provide notice and documentation.

The regulations differentiating psychiatric service dogs from other service animals are discriminatory if not criminal. Service animals are specifically trained to mitigate a disability; ESA's are not. I am disabled as defined by the ADA and have been diagnosed as having agoraphobia with panic disorder (300.21 DSM-IV; also noted by the AMA as a non-parity, biological illness) and in addition to weekly visits to my LPC, I also take a handful of medication including an SSRI and a Class C narcotic to manage my symptoms. However, medication isn't always effective, especially during severe panic attacks. My psychiatric service dog has been trained to mitigate my disability by performing several physical tasks to prevent and aid in treating my panic attacks as well as preventing them. 

Due to the high dosage of my prescribed SSRI, I am also prone to going into serotonin syndrome; a life threatening  reaction due to having too much serotonin in the body. There is no ""warning"" to this syndrome and if not treated rapidly, is fatal. My psychiatric service dog has been trained to alert me both physically and verbally when he smells a distinct increase of this chemical; often within an hour or two of what would be the onset of physical symptoms such as convulsions, confusion, tachycardia, hyperventilation, hypothermia, and pupil dilation. The only treatment for serotonin syndrome is benzodiazepine sedation of which I ingest in pill form. For the benzodiazepine to be absorbed by my body and begin to counter-act the excessive amount of serotonin in my body, I would have to ingest this pill 45 minutes prior to the onset of symptoms. As I can not determine myself when or where my body may go into serotonin syndrome, it is critical that my psychiatric service dog accompanies me at all times.",,,,,,,

To segregate those with such invisable disabilities, such as psychiatric illnesses, that would greatly impact those with such disabilities in using their service animals is purely wrong.
Service animals helps those with a wide range of disablilities in mantaining a more fullfilling life.  These animals are highly trained in order to help their disabled handlers in a variety of ways that can be difficult to ponder etc. due to the fact that each disabled individual has thier own individual needs unlike any other person who may even have the same disorder as an example.  Service animals are not like emotional support animals (ESA's have no paticular training and are just pets. Also concluding that service animals are trained a variety of ways etc. thus making such a requirement to training documentation also discriminatory) and should not be treated as such...to do so is extremely disciminatory to say the least.  I personally have many loved ones who live far away and to have to deal with taking a plane etc. if someone were sick or may have passed without my service animal would be extremely difficult to impossible.  Its like telling someone who cant walk they can not have their wheelchair with them to get around because someone doesnt like wheelchairs etc.  A service animal is a tool used by any legally disabled individual that can benefit.... It is NOT a pet. 

I highly recommend you take all objections to these discriminatory changes with great care.  I know PSDS has made great efforts in trying to educate on this issue and I am also in full support of what they are also trying to achieve.

So please dont throw us (those with a variety of invisable disabilities) into the trash and discriminate any disabled people they may need the use of a service animal!!!

Instead of delaying the ruling, they put it into effect.  I have friends who will no longer fly because of the requirements of this ruling.  Their independence has been taken away!

If the Department truly feels that people are faking service animals, please consider posting the consequence of doing this in the ruling instead of singling out one class of disabled people.  Such consequence could be a fine or possible imprisonment.  {THINK...beaches with signs of a dollar amount for littering always seem cleaner for some reason}...Have it listed in the rules.

The presence of this animal can allow the person to take less medication, need fewer visits to the doctor and be as fully functional as possible.  A Service Dog is a Service Dog.  These are well-behaved dogs that have received obedience and advanced training in an effort to mitigate an individual's life limiting disability.  

Emotional Support Animals (ESA's) are pets that people use for emotional support.  There is no training needed for an animal to be considered as an ESA because they are pets, not service animals.  Lumping these two categories of support together makes no sense.

The new rules single out persons using psychiatric service animals and establish separate policies for them to fly.  Mental illness is the same as any other physical illness and should be treated the same as heart disease or diabetes. .

Yet, you are requiring those living with a mental illness to book an appointment with their healthcare provider well enough in advance of travel (4-6 weeks) so that the provider has time to produce the letter.  They must also pay a doctor’s office co-pay if they have insurance (approximately $30), or pay out of pocket (minimally $150).  The letter must be given to the airlines with 48 hours advance notice. 

In contrast, persons with any other type of disability may bring their service animal on board without any documentation, advance notice, or extra expense. Again, this is discrimination on the basis of disability in air travel, which is expressly forbidden by the ACAA.

Please reconsider these rulings.  Mental health consumers are making their voices heard on many issues including Mental Health Parity legislation, which treats mental illness, the same as physical illness.

Allowing the airlines to require 48 hours notice is not a problem, as it is not a requirement so the airlines are free to waive the rule or the amount of time for last-minute bookings.  Many passengers with service animals of other types (guide, mobility, hearing, etc.) always notify the airline in advance so they can be assigned to the seat that works best for them (either bulkhead or another seat) and have it noted not to move them.

Many PSDS supporters are confused by the ACAA regulations because PSDS promoted a statement that was in error in regards to the regulations.  The supporters often quote the statement as all airlines are required to require documentation and are required to require the 48-hour notice with there being no regards to last-minute flight bookings (as in ESA/PSA owners wouldn't be able to get on a plane if they bought a ticket less than 48 hours in advance of the flight).  So, I do think the DOT needs to release a statement to clarify the regulations, but the regulations themselves are good, helpful, and should be kept.

As for the confidentiality of the doctor's letter, in my experience (when I had an ESA), the airline does not keep copies of the letters on file or anywhere else.  They look over the letter handed to them by the passenger to see that it fits their requirements and then they hand it back to the passenger.  Therefore, there is no need to worry about the information getting into the wrong hands and there is no need to set up a system for such letters.",,,,,,,

Under these new regulations, as a PSD handler I am required to check in 1 hour prior to the ‘general public’, provide 48-hour advance warning that my dog will be accompanying me, as well as documentation proving my illness.  This rule does not apply to handlers of non-Psychiatric Service Dogs.  

The Department of Transportation (DOT)  has claimed that “The entire purpose of the ACAA, and the Department’s rules implementing it, are to ensure nondiscriminatory air travel opportunities are available to people with disabilities.”  Yet, the ACAA has now drawn a line between the psychiatrically disabled, and the rest of the disabled community by requiring additional documentation.  Yes, this is discrimination.

The DOT has proposed that this is because PSDs have a higher prevalence of ‘fakers’… yet there is no data to support this.  Truly, for a determined person it would be just as easy to fake a mobility assistance dog, or a medical alert dog for seizures, diabetes, or even heart disease.  This ‘reason’ is nullified.

Psychiatric Service Dogs in-Training undergo intense and comprehensive training in order to mitigate the handler’s disability through either ‘tasks’ or ‘work’.   This training must be completed before they are graduated to full Service Dog (SD) status, just as all other forms of SDs do.  Emotional Support Animals (ESAs), on the other hand, are not subject to the same rigorous training.  They also do not ‘mitigate a disability’.  They are pets.  Their presence is for emotional support only, and is not directly medically related.

There is a vast difference between the two.  ESAs are pets, and PSDs are just that – Service Dogs.  My dog and I, as a Psychiatric Service Dog team, deserve to be treated as any other SD team.

I am in the process of training a Psychiatric Service Dog (PSD) for myself, in hopes that it will allow me more freedom, and the ability to do things I am incapable of right now.  Unfortunately, the new regulations to the ACAA have threatened to take away some of this freedom.

Not only are these new regulations unlawful on multiple counts, but they are also amoral!  Is it fair to ask me to provide proof of my disability just because I have a PSD?  Is it fair to force me to reveal something so personal, just so I can fly with my SD?  Is it fair for the airlines to demand paperwork, just so I can hold on to what small chance at a normal life I do have?  No, I think not.  In fact, I think it’s asinine that the airlines feel they have the right to such confidential information.

For the readers out there with MI:  TRIGGER WARNING

I am an 18 year old college student.  I am a survivor of sexual abuse.  I am formally diagnosed with Depression, Bipolar II Disorder, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  But this is not how I want the world to see me.  In the years I have been pursuing recovery, I have grown into a much stronger young woman.  I wish for the world to see me as such.  Though you may not see my disability, and I do not make it apparent, it is there nonetheless.  I do not need this type of discrimination and ostracization as yet another reason to feel alienated by society.

This rule proposal is against everything this country stands for. People of this country worked long and hard to protect those with disabilities. This rule destroys that work.
 
* This rule discriminates against an entire class of people with disabilities
 
* Fraudulent activity is not a valid reason to discriminate against people with mental illness who use service animals
 
* Please note that psychiatric service dogs are no more susceptible to fraudulent activities than any other type of service animal. Any type Service Animal can be faked. Most people probably would not even WANT to identify themselves as mentally ill if there is another disability that they could choose from to fake a Service Dog. 

It seems to me that this rule is being set up for other reasons than what has been stated. A way to select out 'scary' people with mental illness.
 
Please abandon this misleading and discriminatory rule proposal.  Even if it stays a rule, can you imagine it will stand up to even the simplest Constitutional, ADA-based  and/or judicial challenge? People in the mental health community WILL stand up for themselves.

PSD users have been singled out with an undue burden in order to fly. The rationale given is that there is a significant amount of 'faking' in this category of service dog. Seizure and diabetic alert service dogs, and Hearing dogs for the Deaf can be faked just as easily, but they are not being singled out. Why are all service dog users not required to submit documentation of their disability by their medical provider with an ICD-9 code in the letter, and required to notify the airline 48 hours in advance of flying? Yet this is what PSD users are required to do. If a person who is blind was required to do this, an outcry would occur and the regulation would be immediately quashed, due to their enormous lobbying base. The documentation requirement is an undue burden: a letter with a DSM-IV diagnosis signed by a psychiatrist to be submitted to the airline before we are permitted to fly and 48 hours advance notice to the airline as well. Psychiatrists are booked months in advance, a copay is incurred and a charge upwards of $50 is normally charged for any paperwork. It is a financial burden not faced by other service dog users. HIPPA regulations make it illegal to intrude upon an individual's medical history; this regulation breaks that law. The ADA prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, yet these rules discriminate against one singled-out class. PSD users are painfully aware of the stigma still attached to persons with a mental illness and these rules perpetuate that stigma. Because of this stigma, we hold our dogs to a higher standard; they are better trained and more well behaved than many 'program' dogs. I urge you to stop discrimination against PSD users via these Rules. It is unfair and an undue burden they should not be forced to bear.",,,,,,,

I am happy to say that following that incident, she acquired a dog who first became her Emotional Support Animal who she then trained to be her Psychiatric Service Animal.  It is truly beautiful to see how he is tuned in to her needs and how he is able to help her mitigate her anxiety to the point that she and her PSA now fly to visit us on a regular basis in Florida.

While the PSDS organization would like to have you think, ""DOT does not have adequate evidence that there is a problem with people trying to sneak pets aboard aircraft, so as to justify imposing the procedural requirements on PSA users,"" that is simply not true. There is rampant abuse of the ACAA laws by both pet and show dog owners. Dog show people who do this often brag about using this law to get their show dogs on planes and they teach others how to do it, as well. Pet owners who do this have been found out many times by both the public and service dog users when they admit what they did, brag about what they did, or give a wink-wink about their little Fluffy being a service dog.

The problem with differentiating psychiatric service animals from emotional support animals like the PSDS promotes is that a good number of the ""PSAs"" are really ESAs yet illegally passed off as PSAs for various reasons. In order for a dog to be a PSA, it must have been trained to do tasks or trained to do work (a series of tasks) which directly mitigates the person's disabilities (a dog that only retrieves items is not a service dog for somebody who is not disabled in getting those items). Presence of the dog, the dog behaving on a leash, looking at the dog, being with the dog, hugging/kissing the dog, petting the dog, etc. are not anything a dog is trained to do and also are not tasks/work. Those animals are emotional support animals.

Emotional support is not something a dog, other being, or object gives or does. It is a willful act inside a human's body. Science has proven that a human gets the same emotional support from inanimate objects as they do from dogs and other living beings. A young child's ""security blanket"" is another example.

To allow an airline to require a doc's letter for proof is good. There is no harm in the advanced notice allowance even though some percieve such.",,,,,,,

I agree in whole with The Psychiatric Service Dog Society's submission. They have spelled out all the reasons this ruling is discriminatory and unacceptable while also providing some non-discriminatory solutions to replace the current ruling.  

The current ruling is also completely ineffective. People without disabilities wishing to misrepresent their pets can fake other types of service animals such as guide, hearing, medical alert, mobility or seizure response and not be required to provide any evidence beyond credible verbal assurance. 

While I do support the requirements for travelling with a Emotional Support Animal - I think it needs to be made very clear that psychiatric service dogs are NOT emotional support animals. Service dogs - for any disability, psychiatric or otherwise, undergo many hours of intense training. They are appropriately trained for public access in addition to the work and/or tasks that mitigate the handers disability. ESA's require no training of any nature and nor do they provide a specific function in the same way a service dog does.

I do not believe there should be any distinctions between service dogs. All service dogs, regardless of the type of service they provide, are treated equally under the Americans with Disabilities Act - Airlines should not be able to segregate service dogs in to different classes with differing requirements for travel.",,,,,,,

I have a mental ilness and recently started working with a psychiatric service animal  (PSD). I don't understand why there is an issue separating mental disabilities from physical disabilities. Mental disabilities are, afterall, physiological in basis- neurochemistry - which is PHYSICAL- therefore a PHYSICAL disability. The only real difference is that we are hit with STIGMA. 

I don't understand why the DOT wants to differentiate between SDs and PSDs. You don't want a blind person to walk into walls in the plane, so a SD helps them. Similarly, you don't want a person with an MI (mental illness) to ""freak out"" while on a plane, so a dog helps them.

Personally, I have Bipolar, ADD and some PTSD. I am not happy to have these problems. In fact, I am quite UNLUCKY to have these horrible problems, to have been beaten badly many many times by an abuser, to have survived the burning wreckage of a plane crash - and then to develop an MI over the whole thing and have it nearly stop me completely in my tracks. I have a life to live! I have a family!

So when I discovered a dog, a dog trained to help me with specific tasks to help me with MY illness, that was a gift! A GIFT to me. I think it was a Godsend to receive this gift, something that could in any way help mitigate my symptoms, along with traditional medications and regular doctor visits.

Now, to be segregated by type of illness, c'mon. It's NOT AMERICAN, is it? To discriminate in this way? Are you really going to do this?

Mu uncle is going to die soon, and I will need to fly to go to his funeral. Maybe even I could catch a last day or two of his life. How am I going to do that if I am required to make plane travel arrangements 48 hrs in advance? Can you tell me that? What about War Veterans who are aided with PSDs. Are you going to deny them their PSD?

Please reconsider this measure.

Such stringent ""proof"" as this rule requires of the mentally disabled is not required of others using service dogs, and only serves to further ostracize those in the mental health community. 

Furthermore, the categorical lumping of PSDs and ESAs serves to reflect ignorance on the subject matter, and seems to argue that the two should be addressed equally, when they are anything but equal in the eyes of the law.  PSDs undergo the same degree of rigorous training (yes, often by their own handlers) that other types of so-called ""physical-disability"" service dogs do.  If the airline industry wishes to permit ESAs, it is their prerogative to do so.  However, there is a profound distinction between the training, temperament, and legal access rights of PSDs vs ESAs. 

I can understand the frustration of those in the industry who must deal with those individuals falsely claiming their pet to be a service animal.  However, the burden rests on the airlines to deal with such instances of fraud.  It is unreasonable and discriminatory to shift this burden only to those traveling with PSDs.  Their disabilities are as real as those with with more visible medical issues, and they likely wish to keep their conditions just as private.  

The current rules protect neither the airlines, passengers, nor those who are mentally disabled.  

If your intention with this rule was to truly be ""nondiscriminatory,"" then remove the restrictions and requirements that only apply to those traveling with PSDs.",,,,,,,

My wife has suffered from profound anxiety for many years, and has been unable to fly due to the debilitating panic attacks that ensued from the time she would book her flight.

With the recent addition of a psychiatric service dog to our family, I was thrilled with the idea that we may be able to again enjoy the benefits of air travel.  However, after learning that she would be required to reveal her mental disability to the airlines, 48 hours beforehand and with a doctor's note (permission slip?!), she became quite disheartened.

Why should she have to jump through such hoops when others bringing service dogs on airplanes are not asked to do the same?  With this rule, you are singling out people with mental disabilities for undue attention and scrutiny- which is not only counter to the very point of the ADA, but also violates HIPPA.  My wife's MEDICAL condition is her own business, and quite frankly, she has enough to deal with without having to 'prove' that her PSD is a legitimate service dog by way of revealing her private business.

Repeal this rule.  It only serves to illustrate your own ignorance of how vitally important PSDs are to their handler's quality of life.",,,,,,,

        Emotional support animals are pets, not service animals.  They do not qualify in the same category. If you are concerned with the possible abuse of emotional support animals, address that specific issue. Emotional support dog is not the same thing as a Service Dog. 
       There is no data regarding fraudulent use of psychiatric service animals. This is evident when you did not report the data.

Do not single out people partnered with psychiatric service dogs.  

It is discrimination to allow airlines to require medical documentation from a psychiatric service dog handler to prove a psychiatric disability for that person to be allowed to take his or her place among the other passengers.  To require this medical documentation 48 hours in advance of the flight makes the discrimination even more onerous.   

It is abhorrent for non-medical personnel to have access to a person's medical information.  There are no provisions stating which airline staff will have lawful access to this private information, nor how long the documentation will be kept, where it will be stored and no assurances that it will be properly disposed of.

The issue seems to be that the DOT does not recognize a difference between a psychiatric service dog (PSD) and an emotional support animal (ESA).  PSDs are trained animals who work for their handlers to mitigate effects of disability.  Just like all other service dogs, PSDs are specifically trained to navigate calmly and politely within all places accessible to the public.  This requires advanced obedience, as well as extensive exposure and training to function properly in public places.  

ESAs are pets which are considered therapeutically necessary for the disabled person.  They are valuable in their own right, but they are not service animals.

The ACAA document states these new regulations are intended to eliminate fraud perpetrated by people bringing their pets into the cabin as PSDs or ESAs.  Discriminating against service dog handlers who have psychiatric disabilities will not accomplish this goal.  People who are intent on deceit will simply claim that their pet is a seizure alert service dog or diabetes alert service dog.  

Preventing fraud by discriminating against an entire group within the disabled community is not acceptable.",,,,,,,

As a high functioning person with bipolar disorder, I find it hard enough to convince potential employers of the necessity of my Service Dog; I am outraged that the DOT would take it upon itself to target psychiatric Service Dogs in order to identify (before transporting) those who have any sort of mental illness.  

The new rules ask us to do something that is not required of any other single person with a disability: not people with visual impairments or hearing impairments Guide or Hearing dogs – not even diabetics or epileptics who use Medical Alert or Response Service Dogs.

Under the new rules, persons with mental illnesses would have to make an appointment with their doctor well before their travel date, thus incurring a co-pay or visit charge as well as (in some cases) a cost to produce the letter the DOT is requiring.  Many people with disabilities (mentally or otherwise) live within a fixed income and this could produce a hardship not imposed upon any other disabled group.  

When a person with paraplegia arrives at an airport terminal, no one questions their right to have a Service Dog.  When I arrive with mine, people immediately ask the invasive question: “What’s wrong with you?”  My medical records are protected by HIPPA, as are every American citizen’s.  I don’t feel I should have to share my diagnoses, or even the fact that I am being treated for a disabling mental illness, with an airline before I fly.  This is discrimination on the basis of disability in air travel, which is expressly forbidden by the Air Carriers Access Act (ACAA).

I understand the use of psychiatric service dogs is abused.  However, this does not give cause to single us out for identification on mass transportation.  Any rule can be abused; how hard is it to obtain crutches or a wheelchair for someone with perfectly functioning limbs in order to reap benefits intended for people that have a physical disability?  The animals that are branded “service dogs” can be ill-behaved whether they are used for physical OR mental illnesses.  Regarding this issue, training is paramount.  

Among those who are physically disabled, we who use Service Dogs for mental illness are already singled out and disparaged for our use of them.  It is hard enough to be castigated by other people who are disabled (albeit physical versus mental); must we also live being pariahs when trying to travel? 

The Mental Health Parity (MHPA) legislation is only our community’s first step in obtaining equality with physically disabled persons.  It is a constant struggle to obtain and preserve the parity to which we are constitutionally entitled. I ask that you help us advance this purpose by reconsidering the recent rulings.",,,,,,,

An ESA is a pet with no formal training as a Service Animal but taught to behave in public. It is not trained to perform tasks nor to do work. A PSD is trained to perform tasks and do work, as well as trained to behave appropriately in public. It is a misnomer to lump the two together. A PSD is a Service Animal just like a guide dog for a person who is blind, or a Hearing Dog for a person who is Deaf or Hard of Hearing. All these categories of Service Animals are trained to perform tasks or do work, depending on the needs of the owner/handler. Please recognize the difference between an ESA and a Service Animal, which includes a PSD. Requiring an ESA owner to provide documentation is appropriate; requiring a PSD owner/handler to do the same is not. If Service Animals for persons with other types of disabilities are not required to submit documentation of their disability, then neither should this type of undue burden be place upon PSD owner/handlers. It is unfair to categorically discriminate against one type of Service Animal because: a) confusion exists between ESA and PSD; b) there is a suspicion of abuse of the ESA category; and c) there is no documented abuse of the PSD category. To sanction discrimination against an individual that uses a PSD based on undocumented abuse of the PSD category and suspicion of abuse of the ESA category is unfair and inappropriate, not to mention illegal.The Americans With Disabilities Act includes protection for PSD users; these Rules are the only place where discrimination occurs.

Allowing the airlines to require 48 hours notice is not a problem, as it is not a requirement so the airlines are free to waive the rule or the amount of time for last-minute bookings."" /____/
This point is analogous to saying that merely allowing people to own slaves is unproblematic, since no one's required to, so people could not own slaves as they see fit.  Clearly, allowing an injustice, even if that injustice isn't required, is still an injustice.  Allowing discrimination against persons with specific kinds of disabilities, in addition making it seem like standard protocol to, and somehow relying on the good faith of every airline employee not to discriminate--well, this is ill-considered and naive in the most harmful way. /____/
(2) ""As for the confidentiality of the doctor's letter, in my experience (when I had an ESA), the airline does not keep copies of the letters on file or anywhere else. They look over the letter handed to them by the passenger to see that it fits their requirements and then they hand it back to the passenger. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the information getting into the wrong hands and there is no need to set up a system for such letters. "" /____/
This sentiment is equally naive, and is analogous to thinking that since you've never been the victim of identity theft, there's no need for a system to protect anyone from identity theft.  Unlike the healthcare industry, which has explicit standards for handling personal health information (via HIPAA), there are no clear standards for airline personnel.  An intelligent system is designed to prevent mishaps, not assume they'll never happen, but if they do, provide an ad hoc patch.  Allowing airlines to require documentation and notice is wrong, at least for service animals, but if it happens, it should at least be done right.",,,,,,,

This is not a valid reason for discrimination against psychiatric service animal users. If written documentation is not required for non-psychiatric service animals, it should not be required for psychiatric service animals. Not requesting the identical documentation from all other people with disabilities discriminates against a single population of people who use service dogs to assist with their disabilities. 
There are no data to prove that Psychiatric Service Animals are ‘faked’ more than other types of service animal. This false claim by the DOT has been made simply because a psychiatric service dog handler’s disability is invisible. To assume this with no data discriminates against an entire population of disabled people, i.e., individuals with mental illnesses, including military veterans who have come home suffering from PTSD, one of many serious (though invisible) psychiatric diagnoses for which psychiatric service dogs have provided enormous undeniable assistance. The creators of the ACAA wisely forbade discrimination against some individuals with a clause addressing nondiscrimination on the basis of disability. If documentation, 48 hours notice, special certificates, doctor's notes, letter to the airline, etc. is not required for all people who rely on service dogs, people with PSDs should not be forced to meet special requirements.

They will merely change tactics, and state that their pet is a seizure alert dog, or a diabetes alert dog, or come on board with a cane feigning mobility issues.  I actually know of two people who planned to feign blindness, wear their sunglasses in the cabin, and state that their dogs were guide dogs!

The DoT has claimed that this is a serious problem, and that there are many examples of those with pets claiming a psychiatric disability boarding planes.  Why, then, do they have no documentation of these claims?  Who is keeping track of all this?  So far, no evidence has been presented.  

I for one resent this discrimination.  Why should I be subjected to screening that others with service dogs are not?
This regulation undermines the ADA, and is discriminates against a group of people who are already marginalized by society.

Please rescind 14CFR 382.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,

Valerie Stocking",,,,,,,

Per ACAA definitions: ""Service Animal
Any animal that is individually trained or able to provide assistance to a qualified person with a disability; or any animal shown by documentation to be necessary for the emotional well being of a passenger.""
Note the first clause of that phrase.  A PSD does much more than help with a persons emotional well being.  They don't just sit there and look cute.  They are by definition trained to mitigate their partner's disability.  

Some PSD are even able to do some of their work in flight.  Many can alert their handler to an oncoming panic attack, allowing the partner to begin relaxation techniques or take necessary rescue medications just for one example.  This happens much earlier than the handler would normally notice by themself, which can allow the chance to avoid a scene in flight.  In the airport, they can help mitigate the effects of some medications that are often taken pre-flight that have side effects such as dizziness.  Some PSD are trained in balance and guide work to assist their partners in safely moving around in crowds.
A sample IAADP task that could transfer to an in flight environment: ""Dog is trained to vigorously lick someone’s face on command to bring his partner to full awareness, just as seizure response dogs can be trained to do when their partner is extremely groggy after a grand mal, which shortens the recovery time.  This unpleasant tactile stimulation also can divert the partner’s attention from something that triggers tears or other inappropriate emotional reactions in school or a workplace.""
Most service animals just hang out for the ride, a PSD can feasibly be actively on duty for the flight.",,,,,,,

I agree with the PSDS's opinion on the issue of extra restrictions being placed on only PSD and not other types of service animals.  
A PSD has had extensive training in how to behave in public and in tasks or work that mitigate their handler's disability.  They are not pets, but they are pieces of medical equipment, just like a service dog trained to help with any other type of disability such as blindness, deafness, or mobility impairments.

An ESA is a pet that has been given legal status and access to non pets housing under the Fair Housing Act, and to airplanes by the ACAA.  They do not have to have any special training.  

Requiring one class of disability to get documentation that is not required of other people with disabilities or other passengers is discrimination.  (I'm not even going into the associated costs etc. which have been brought up numerous other times.) Some doctors will not write notes as not all doctors are familiar with the possibility that a dog can be trained to help a person with a mental disability as they are a relatively new concept.  In addition to the PSDS, the IAADP (International Association of Service Dog Partners) and ADI (Assistance Dogs International) which are both long standing entities in the SD world recognize a PSD as a legitimate type of service dog.  The US government (DOD/VA) is funding a study of service dogs for PTSD for returning war veterans.  Is the DOT honestly going to tell disabled war veterans that they have to go through extra red tape to catch a flight because their disability is mental instead of physical? 

I would also like to add that of all the possible things to choose to fake a SD for, I would think that mental illness would be someone's last choice.  There's a lot of stigma involved with mental illness, as proven here by the acts of the DOT.  Diabetes, seizures, and many other invisible disabilities do not have near the stigma involved.",,,,,,,

I propose allowing all service animals the same ""credible verbal/visual assurance"" and actually levying a heavy fine and/or jail time for people that are not disabled and lie about taking their untrained pets and show dogs (for a previously listed example) with them as a service animal.  A person caught faking could be blacklisted from flying for a predetermined amount of time such as 3-5 years along with a heavy fine.  Make it so that doing it twice results in mandatory jail time, even stiffer fines, permanent no flight status, and permanent removal of the animal from their possession.  Make it a very unattractive option to be caught flying without a disability and claiming your dog is a service animal or even with a disability claiming your untrained animal as a service animal.

A person with a disability isn't always going to be carrying documentation stating they are disabled (see also title 3 of the ADA, the Business Brief, and FAQ from the ADA), however they would likely be able to back it up after the trip has been completed and they are back home.  Someone faking wouldn't have the same luxury.  Find a way to flag the person if it really is that bad in an individual situation and afford the person a reasonable opportunity to either clear up their disabled status or if in question the dog is indeed a trained service dog for their disability upon return home and if they can't provide reasonable proof (such as a training journal or if trained by a school or private trainer documentation from them stating the dog has been trained) then begin prosecution.",,,,,,,

I thought we were actually at a point where society was working past the stigma associated with mental illness.  Sadly, it seems the DOT is way behind the times.

ESA's are another matter entirely.  They are not legally recognized as SERVICE DOGS, nor do they (or should they) be put into the same category as PSDs.

Having a Psychiatric Service Dog allows people with a disabling mental illness to more successfully live life.  Discriminating against such service dog handlers is wrong, and should not be tolerated.

If having their service dog,"" they"" meaning people with emotional issues and mental health issues (which are quite intertwined), is a calming and much needed effect on a plane with people who are unknown to the dog's owner, how can anyone not see the benefits to everyone on the plane? If someone with a mental illness and an amputation brought a service dog on a plane and had a letter proving this was ""legal"" due to an amputation and trouble being mobile, nobody would think twice about it The mental illness would be unknown to the airlines and the amputation would be acceptable, but to the dog's owner, it would be incredibly important to have the dog along because of whatever the trip could cause without the dog's support.

Equate the Service dog to the need for a person to take tranquilizers or sedatives. Or even a person suffering from a heart condition. Should those persons be required to be drug free and not have medication available on the flight? 

The right of a person to be accompanied by a service animal must be applied equally and can not be restricted to just the visible disability. That right to be accompanied by a service animal must be applied equally to all persons with a disability. Failure to provide equal treatment results in a discrimination and will result in much litigation in the Courts.

I would urge the Department of Transportation to restrict their rules to that which provides equal treatment under the law. To deviate from that equal treatment would be discrimination without a question.

What may concern America’s Veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan diagnosed with PTSD or other invisible wounds of war is that DOT's new rules [Sections J82.1J 7(e) & 382.27(c)(8)] violate the legislative intent of the law (49 U.S.C. 41705), which provides that no air carrier may discriminate against any otherwise qualified individual with a disability, by reason of such disability, in the provision of air transportation. I believe that the revised regulations governing Psychiatric Service Animals unfairly discriminates against people with psychiatric disabilities. Most psychiatric disabilities, including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), are by nature a hidden disability, unlike more apparent physical disabilities that can be seen with the naked eye. The requirements spelled out in Section 382.117(e) are discriminatory for people with hidden disabilities versus people with physical disabilities, thereby treating one class of disabled passengers differently than other classes of disabled passengers, as well as their nondisabled counterparts. The requirement also imposes on passengers with psychiatric disabilities new time restrictions, added expenses and potentially embarrassing situations with airport and airline staff that forces them to reveal the nature of their hidden disability - which also raises significant privacy concerns. The DOT requirements should also have input from the various airlines that have to implement these rules, because the end result will most certainly be legal litigation aimed at the Airline Industry and DOT. Furthermore, since no data exists to document that a problem exists whereby passengers without disabilities are trying to ""pass off pets as service animals, DOT's requirement is punishing the very passengers that it is intended to protect under the law. It appears that the more prudent approach would involve DOT working with input from the airlines - and advocacy groups - on data collection to ascertain whether widespread misuse and violations of the protections by non-disabled passengers exists before imposing an added barrier to passengers needing Psychiatric Service Animals.",,,,,,,

Why shouldn't this rule expand to include a requirement that  individuals seeking to eat in a restaurant with their service animal will need to submit documentation a day in advance of their reservation?

It seems that airline personnel can easily determine if a claimant has an animal that is not able to comply with the behavioral boundaries expected of a qualified service animal.

I believe it IS reasonable for customers to provide documentation that their service animal has been ""certified"" by an organization, as well as their physician.

But to require an additional set of ""hoops"" for those who are legitimately disabled, is a set-back.

One additional note:  To ask those veterans who now utilize service animals for their PTSD diagnosis, to go through the additional humiliation of discussing why their animal is accompanying them, only re-introduces the pain and terror that brought on the condition in the first place.

For the record, I am an individual with a ""physical"" disability that has been certified by vocational rehabilitation.  I have not, nor do I intend, to seek any financial benefit.  My own service animal is certified and has flown without difficulty on a number of occassions.

I have, however, been the victim of job discrimination that could not be protected because I was considered a ""contractor.""

In conclusion:  Are there people who violate the spirit and intent of the A.D.A. in order to travel with their animals?  Undoubtedly, yes.

These rules demand written documentation, such as a note from a mental health professional testifying to the need for the animal to accompany the passenger, 48 hours in advance for both psychiatric service animals and emotional support animals to be allowed on an aircraft.

Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel

General Comment

In 1990, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) promulgated the official regulations implementing the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA).  As guidance for these regulations, the DOT used the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) service animal guide issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in July 1996.  The purpose of the DOJ and ADA was and still is to promote equal access and inclusion to all individuals with disabilities.  Part 382 references the ADA and the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) for such concepts as “equivalent facilitation” of service animals.  It is quite clear that the meaning of the ADA and ADAAG as issued by the DOJ is quite prevalent in these regulations.  However, under the Final Rule, published on May 13, 2009, there is an extreme deviation from the meaning or intent of the ADA, the ADAAG, the DOJ or the Americans with Disabilities Amendment Act (ADAA) .  At no time in the previous documents mentioned has it ever been considered, intended or acceptable to discriminate against a disability group, solely on the “fear” that someone may attempt to take advantage of the situation.  This “fear” is the same fear that has bred discrimination and continues to breed discrimination to this very day.  Discrimination will never be eliminated until such fears can be eliminated.   The outward appearance of combining a group of individuals with a disability who use qualified service animals and a group of individuals with a disability who do not have qualified service animals is simply to make it easier to discriminate against the group of individuals with a disability who use qualified service animals simply because of unwarranted and unjustified “fears” of some action that “may” occur in the future.  It is pointed out that the DOT has found individuals in both groups attempting to abuse this rule.  However, it is very difficult to believe that in the grand scope of all airline travels, that this is a major problem as much as some “isolated” incidents that have occurred in the past.  Of all of the major issues that face our airlines today, this has the appearance of being a minimal issue.  

The new provision “refines DOT’s previous definition of service animal by making it clear that animals that assist persons with disabilities by providing emotional support qualify as service animals and ensuring that, in situations concerning emotional support animals and psychiatric service animals, the authority of airline personnel to require documentation of the individual’s disability and that the passenger needs the emotional support or psychiatric service animal as an accommodation for air travel and/or for activity at the destination of the passenger traveling with the animal is understood”.  This serves to make it a “separate subgroup of a disability group”.   Although it is mentioned that many people use different terms for their service animals, typically describing the service the animal provides to the individual, i.e., seizure alert, hearing, signal, and psychiatric, etc., these are all qualified as service animals and fall under the protections of the ADA and the DOJ.  

There is mention of having a wide variety of service animals for individuals, i.e., cat, monkey, etc.,  however there is no mention of the fact that under the DOJ’s proposed regulations, service animals must be domesticated animals, i.e., no reptiles (lizards), no primates (monkeys), or other livestock (miniature horses).  These are the types of animals used as examples when the DOT created the new ACAA Rule 382 provisions.  Obviously, these animals would make it difficult to distinguish between pets and service animals.  However, with the removal of these types of animals from this argument, the only reasoning left to discriminate against individuals with service animals, regardless of the services provided, is for convenience of airline personnel, as “clear guidelines are needed to assist airline personnel...” in identifying service animals.  

As pointed out in the Guidance for Service Animals created by the DOT, training is, in most situations, the key.  However, the definition of service animal also includes an animal that has been shown to have the innate ability to assist a person with a disability.  Some animals that can provide functions for individuals independent of training are still considered service animals.  In determining if an animal is a service animal, the ACAA indicates that the airline personnel may 1) Obtain credible verbal assurance; 2) Look for physical indicators; 3) Request documentation of service animals other than emotional support or psychiatric service animals; 4) Require documentation for emotional support animals and psychiatric service animals; and 5) Observe the behavior of the animal.  The DOJ indicates that if a person is unclear if an animal is a service animal, he or she may ask only “what service does the animal perform?”  Inquiry into training is inappropriate as was just indicated, not all animals require specific training to perform functions for individuals.  Again, asking how an animal performs these tasks is inappropriate, as it goes beyond what is acceptable under the ADA and DOJ.  It should be understood that there must be some training for the animal, being obedience at a minimum, to ensure that the animal will not lunge, bark, growl, etc., which may disqualify the animal as a service animal, due to aggressiveness.  

It is inappropriate to place such differing disability groups, i.e., psychiatric service animal users versus emotional support animal users, into one “lump” group for individuals with psychiatric disabilities.  The stigma of having a mental illness or psychiatric disability is something that is very hard for an individual to overcome.  Now add the separation from the rest of society because the an individual with a disability has an avenue that will provide relief for psychiatric symptomology (psychiatric service animal), but has to identify their disability and provide documentation, which is not required under the ADA and DOJ, and make 48 hour advance notification of intent to fly with your service animal will only serve to increase the  stigmatization of an already over- stigmatized disability.

I urge you to revoke the rules that require documentation and advance notice of travel for users of psychiatric service animals, and instead follow the guidance of the ADA, DOJ, ADAA, and the ADAAG.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2009-0093-0149/attachment_1.docx",

I believe this to be unconscionable not only for the civilians who use these trained dogs but for our military with PSTD for whom these task trained dogs have broadened life and made life much easier. Several years ago I was denied the usage of a small service dog in a coop, which became Grad V. Royalwood  in the Federal Court System and with the help of MPAS and the DOJ I won the suit. It states in the story that I am bipolar, which while that is true, I am bipolar 2 the lesser of two degrees. The problem which significantly impacts my life is my PTSD.


Unfortunately there are many who do not wish to recognize this vital service dog. It is so important that we get this policy changed. Let's end the discrimination of PSD's now both with the DOT and IRS. IRS only allows medical deductions for those service dogs for individuals with physical problems: guide, seizure, deaf, etc.... The opposition states that fraud will be perpetrated is devoid of these facts. There is no other service dog including those with invisible disabilities, that is required to have documentation from the treating doctor in this case the psychiatrist and a 48 hr time lag from purchase to boarding.

 I am almost 60 and remember how badly we treated our Vets in Nam. Do not let this war continue devoid of the help that a PSD can give a veteran with severe PTSD.

An ESA is NOT the SAME as a PSD, and should need verification. However, to blanket the entire psychiatric community with these penalties when they are not addressed to other invisible disabilities is abhorrent.   PSD's are task trained dogs just as service dogss are trained for persons with physical disabilities.  

Personally speaking, my dog also serves me in mobility.  I see NO reason there should be a (2) service dog allowance.

ESA users, sure, make them do the 48 hr notice and drs note, etc.  This pet/animal has only access rights given them by the DOT in the first place.  ESAs can be used for people with severe non-disabling illnesses, have no access rights at a supermarket or other public places.  PSDs however, are for people with life limiting disabilities, have access rights through the ADA and shouldn't be given discriminatory treatment because of the possibility of a faker.  IF every type of SD needed these requirements, than it would suck, but it would just be what you had to do when flying with your SD.  This law, written as it is is very discriminatory and should have not gotten passed as it is.  Another thought, whats to stop someone who uses a PSD to change their verbiage at airports and say, yes this is my Medical Alert/Response SD.  Then they wouldn't need to jump through these hoops and they wouldn't be lying at all, it is still the truth as many many PSDs also do medical alert or response as a task/work for there handlers.  As to the question that was posed as to how a PSD works for its handler, I know of a PSD who alerts before her handler dissociates/blacks out due to severe DID (dissociative identity disorder), also before using a SD she used to injure herself many times a day, her SD uses tactile stimulation to keep her handler focused and SD body placement to make it physically impossible for the handler to harm herself.  People, objects, and other techniques had been tried in the past, all to no avail.  These are just 2 of over 30 tasks that this SD does to help her handler fly, drive, shop and basically live a more 'normal' life.
Please change this discriminatory ruling.  It is hard enough for a SD user to go through life w/ a SD. Why create one more barrier for our disabled citizens?",,,,,,,

The Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs are now making use of psychiatric service dogs in the treatment of PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). 

A decorated combat veteran, being treated for PTSD with the help of a psychiatric service dog, is denied permission to fly to visit a dying family member because of their service dog. This veteran decides to leave the dog behind due to the time constraints. Later, this same veteran suffers a serious episode that endangers their life or the life of someone else. 

This story is most likely to make the news on some show such as 60 Minutes or 20/20. It will probably make the news around the same time some other unfortunate incident occurs because someone decided to ""sneak"" their dog onto a flight by pretending is a service dog for those suffering from some other ""invisible"" condition that is not psychiatric in nature. 

People will start asking who setup the rules so that they are ineffective and life threatening at the same time. 

Other people making use of service dogs are not required to meet this new rule, only those afflicted with psychiatric disorders such as depression or bipolar syndrome? Why would this rule only apply to those people and not others such as someone making use of a service dog for someone suffering from epileptic seizures or diabetes? Are psychiatric service dogs more susceptible to fraudulent behavior than other types of service dogs? 

How does this regulation stop potential fraud? Is someone who would be willing to commit this type of fraud going to be deterred because they cannot feign being crazy? These same hucksters will suddenly be stopped because everyone knows that crazy people are okay, but you don't want anyone to think you're diabetic or epileptic or blind or deaf or whatever other conditions may apply?

This rule is completely ineffective and a major hindrance in the lives of many people. Some of these may be potentially life threatening in nature. It discriminates against an entire group of people; it discriminates against those suffering from psychiatric disorders. 

If it does not violate the actual words of The American With Disabilities Act, it surely violates the principles upon which the law was originally created. 

This will definitely lead to lawsuits. Lawsuits that are going to cost the government lots of money to fight. These are also lawsuits that will, in all probability, will be lost by the government. 

Finally, why was this regulation originally created? 

The reasoning that it is to prevent fraud and abuse does not make sense. What is to prevent the same huckster from not claiming some other disability. This rule applied to all service dogs would at least make sense from this perspective. 

Was it originally meant to apply to all service dogs, but the bureaucracy felt it couldn't counter all the lawsuits that would be generated if applied in this manner? 

Was it made because someone confused “emotional support dogs” with “psychiatric service dogs”? All pets are “emotional support dogs”. A service dog is something altogether different. It is an understandable confusion, but now would be a good time to learn the differences.",,,,,,,

I have known many peole with cat allergies and it can effect them very quickly and very severely.  What would be done for those people?  Would, for example, the airline contact all the other passengers to tell the, that a cat (or any other animial for that matter) will be on board and they can change flights and then who will cover the cost of changing the flight?  

My experience also has been that work animals are trained and certified - i.e. seeing eye dogs, while psychiatric animcals are not and that can be a huge difference.  Some work dogs you don't even realize they are there, while with an untrained comfort animal, that it unlikely.

Besides blatant bias and disregard for someone's private life there are other questions that need to be answered.  How will the information be protected?  Are the airlines and DOT ready to handle that VERY private information?  Will they be liable if that information is leaked? Why are we putting the onus on people struggling with disabilities?  The responsibility should be on how dogs are registered.  If I did have a registered psychiatric dog, who in the airlines should have a right to question my doctor?

If a dog is registered as a Service Dog it is a Service Dog- period.  If there is a problem with how dogs are registered, then solve the problem there, not with DOT.  This is a case of 'mental profiling'.  Let's take a realistic view: we do not allow for racial or religious profiling, yet we can show data on terrorist attacks and crime rates based on both.  I don't see any data based on the abuse of a service animal (only the anticipation thereof).  If we are questioning the validity of a service dog, should we also question the validity of prescriptions by doctors?  There is so much flawed thinking in this regulation I hope the ACLU and the ADA comes on board.  I suspect this will end up in a lawsuit based on the obvious discrimination.  How do you prove someone with epilepsy really has what they say?  Should they show a 'doctor's note'? And when did DOT and the airlines become the disability police?

My psychiatric service dog alerts to my anxiety before it reaches the point of ""no return"" so to speak. This allows me to medicate myself and come back down from the panic attack before it reaches the point where I would need medical assistance, due to hyperventilation and oxygen deprivation. She also has tasks such as grounding me during a panic attack, providing a physical barrier to assist in lowering triggers, guiding me to the exit of buildings and locating not only my car but my parents and alerting me to people calling my name while in a disoriented state. She will also learn to retrieve medication, bark for help, alert to people calling my name, and prevent me from wandering into the street when in a disoriented state. 

My service dog is just as legitimate as any other service animal, and it is discriminatory to require documentation for some and not others. It would be a better option to require documentation ONLY for emotional support animals, i.e. those that do not have special training and perform tasks to mitigate their handler's disability, or for ALL service animals, as opposed to just some. People with mental illness are already a stigmatized, discriminated against group and this will only reinforce that.",,,,,,,

I would like to see psychiatric service dogs have the same rights as other service dogs in not having to have special documentation to fly. I have a service dog and while he is not for a psychiatric disability, I know of people who with help from their dogs are able to live independently and work in society. 

A well trained service dog is easy to tell apart from someone who is just trying to get their pet on the plane. Service dogs are very highly trained animals and they do not solicit attention, bark (unless they have been trained to do so to get help) beg for food, eliminate inappropriately, cause harm to anyone or otherwise act in any way out of control. They are also well groomed and kept healthy for a long working life.

These psychiatric service dogs have been trained to act on the person's behalf when they need them, and often times the person doesn't know when that will be. They have specific tasks just like any other real service dog. Please keep the rules equal for all service dogs and their handlers. Thank you for your consideration.",,,,,,,

That right there poses a problem for me , I need him to stay focused on me at all times , kinda hard to do with people running up to pet the pretty dog ! I have been asked many times what the dog does for me and why do I need him. Well I don't believe they need to know all about my illness its none of there business's . I don't ask them whats wrong with them , all tho I really would like to !
Please don't make our life any harder than it already is !

It is none of my business why you would need to bring a wheelchair or a cane on board a plane. It is also none of my business why you are over weight, diabetic, or why you have open sores on your skin.  
As I live in the state of Nebraska where dogs as well as any other animal are considered property, that would mean that they are indeed no different than a wheelchair or a cane or a pair of glasses, braces on a person's legs, or an oxygen cart.  
Being asked to tell others of the reason for medical devices, including the exact reason you have a service dog is an invasion of privacy, may compromise your security, and gives people a reason why they can single you out.  
I do agree that some people are abusing the system. I have heard about that. However, if something is to be done about this it shouldn't come at the expense of those that are hurting. The amount of money I get in Social Security does not cover my medical expenses, let alone my living expenses already. Having to ask my Dr. to fill out a lengthy form or a form that displays my disability for all to see or have access to if they would even like to be nosey is wrong. The costs to obtain the mentioned documents in time and money are prohibitive.
While I do not like to disclose what tasks my dog is trained to do, I am currently able to do so in a manner that gives enough information without actually sharing at is exactly wrong with me. A diabetic, may choose to wear a bracelet or necklace, but may always be carrying needles. Needles are a dangerous object, they are also something that is medically needed for their safety and well being. They are not asked to disclose their reason's for carrying needles on board, have a Dr's note and certified beyond a doubt that they are diabetic. They just show up with their needles and medications. It is that simple.",,,,,,,

The decision that is made will affect all of us with psychiatric service animals for years to come. I understand that the airlines think they are curbing misuse of animals and allowing people without a legitimate need to take “fake” service dogs on airplanes.

The problem is you are targeting a class of people with mental illness instead of targeting everyone with an invisible disability. Therefore it is only rational that it has nothing to do with people faking service dogs and everything to do with people with mental illness.

Service Dogs are dogs that are individually trained to help someone with a disability, period. There does not need to be different classifications in order to board an airplane.   We all need to be treated equally.  Our dogs are our lifelines and help us all in unique ways specific to our disabilities but they all are doing a job.

To single out people with mental illness is not only prejudiced but is also saying we are of lower, not trustworthy status. I do not see any requirements for other invisible disabilities such as people with epilepsy, diabetes, hearing loss, cardiac problems etc.

It is a hardship and a burden to come up with the required documentation asked for by the DOT. It is humiliating to have to disclose something as personal as our mental health issues with complete strangers in order to do the exact same thing as the person with a non psychiatric service dog standing right next to me. 

I know the DOT is smart enough to see the error of their decision and to rectify this and treat all persons with service dogs equally and fairly.

There is no need to punish the mentally ill just because some people are trying to fake Service Dogs. There is no evidence that only Psychiatric Service Dogs are the only ones being faked.

People with disabilities and people who use Service Dogs should be treated just like the rest of us. They should be allowed access to planes without inconvenient and unattainable demands you have placed on them.",,,,,,,

These poor people have likely lived horrible lives with only the love of these animals to help them cope. If someone has a mental illness they certainly shouldn't be discriminated against by strangers to satisfy some sadistic legislators who have nothing better to do than come up with more ""rules"" to embarrass and single out the already mistreated members of our society who get a small concession to make their lives easier. There can not possibly be that many people out there thinking up ways to get their little dog on a flight with them when its just as easy to put them under the plane where there are climate controlled compartments. People with pets do not fly with airlines that do not accommodate their pets anyhow. Either I pay more to fly with an airline that has the facilities I want or I drive. perhaps you could change the rule to say that all assistant animals regardless of type should have some kind of documentation on them in case they are asked- that way their private medical information Never even has the chance to be used inappropriately since the airlines don't get involved. Make it a ""passport"" that a patient goes to get once with forms they have filled out by the doctor and then its good for 5 or 10 years. They then have to renew it. You could just add it into any secretary of state office. The patients get to retain their dignity and the airlines get to make sure no one is abusing the system and no one else even has to know what the condition is. That way they only have to have this one thing and they just keep it around for travel. Like a license for a companion animal to fly. The secretary of state office would verify the info and there could be either a nominal fee just to cover costs or perhaps for low income people they could provide proof of other state benefits to get the fee waived.

However, even ESA's should not be discriminated against nor should they be required to be forced to provide documentation stating disability, illness or DSM codes. 

There is a double standard. Let's face it, the real reason for wanting ESA's/psd is to force a standard and control training and push training schools and this control the industry. I suspect the airlines have another motive. To put air marshals on fligths where persons with PTSD are flying. The guilde dog community has always opposed the PSD's and now that we have returning vets from millitary service like myself who need PSD""s  they are supporting it, because of the dollars available from the VA and volunteer donors who support vet causes.

This is already a class of people that suffers from more discrimination than almost any other disability.

Additionally, it is important to note that Emotional Support Animals are a class of pet that has been granted status by the DOT, they are not the same as psychiatric service animals which are not pets. Therefore it is acceptable legally to require different documentation for these different classes of animals. PSDS proposes two possibilities for documentation requirements:
No documentation required for service animals, documentation required for emotional support animals.

One of my clients has a Psychiatric Service Dog (PSA), who accompanies her in public and offers assistance to alleviate anxiety and depressive and panic attacks symptoms. It is my understanding that she received a prescription from a psychiatrist for her service dog.

My client brings her PSA to therapy sessions. The dog is well trained and I have been told by this client and observed how her psychiatric service dog alerts her when she is dissociating.

There appears to be confusion at the very least and certainly discrimination with this new Air Carrier Act requiring differential treatment of passengers using PSA’s as opposed to those using other types of service animals. I support that the 48-hour notice to the airlines not be required of people with psychiatric diagnoses, who use psychiatric Service dogs for these reasons:

1) These changes discriminate against an entire class of people with
disabilities.
2) There is no data regarding fraudulent use of psychiatric service animals.
3) Abuse of the Emotional Support Animals (ESA) category is not a valid reason to discriminate against people with PSAs
4) PSAs are no more likely to be subject to fraudulent behavior than any other type of service animal.

ESAs are pets that have been granted status by the DOT. They are not service animals.  The Psychiatric Service Dog Society (PSDS) proposes no documentation be required for any service animal.

Documentation may be required for ESAs or they may be eliminated from in-cabin air travel.

In summary, I support the Psychiatric Service Dog Society’s position in opposition to the ruling that indicates anyone flying with a Psychiatric service dog make their reservations 48 hours in advance, provide complete diagnoses from a Psychiatrist, and a letter stating that the person is OK to fly. This is discrimination- as no other Service Animal users are asked to do this nor or other passengers.

I would like to comment on the discrimination that is put on to those who require psychiatiric service dogs.  I believe that it is a travesty to make those with invisible disabilities jump through so much hurdles in order to use airlines. 

 I have not seen any data that supports the claim that there are those who falsely state pets as service animals.  

I have a service dog that allows me to be a productive member of society and gives me the freedom that I used to have.


I hope that this severe discrimination can be resolved quickly and to what the Psychiatric Service Dog Society has suggested.

Psychiatric service dogs have actually been known to assist people so much their disability is mitigated--to the point that the person can go back to work and pay taxes and contribute to the gross national product.

Wait, seizures are in the brain too. Are people ""imagining"" them? Are you going to limit seizure alert dogs next?

Quit being so embarrassingly ignorant and allow psychiatric support dogs the coverage of a law that was designed to protect ALL disabled people, not just people you happen to feel sorry for, like blind people, and not the ones with stigma, like mentally ill ones.

   I do not understand why those with any kind of Mental illness must provide proof so often, with updates. Yes, security is an issue but it is for all travellers and I certainly 
 feel it is more than discriminatory to single out those individuals. Whenever I have travelled with Service Dogs in their training, I have never been asked for proof of what the medical need is, I just have to have their paperwork saying the dog is providing a needed job. Medical information on any individual is private info and always has been.

Not all doctors understand or appreciate the use of Service Dogs.  That in itself can cause difficulty for a person if their doctor is not up to date on Service Dogs and their assistance.  Having to see a doctor to have the letter composed costs the patient additional money and ties up the doctor unnecessarily.  

Family and work emergencies can come up, necessitating travel plans that may make 48 hours unreasonable.  The ADA has a reasonable ruling.  It states that disabled with a Service Dog may be asked if they are disabled, asked if the dog is a Service Dog, asked what tasks it performs to mitigate the disability.

Frankly, I would not put one of my pets in an unpressurized, unheated airplane cargo hold for any reason. Because of that, I travel exclusively by private vehicle. If I were forced to fly, I would kennel my pets rather than ship them. 

This is yet another place where common decency and respect for the law SHOULD prevail but they obviously do not because if they did there would not be a problem.

However, I cannot excuse penalizing the disabled simply because some non-disabled people choose to ignore the constraints of simple personal honesty and responsibility. The law is clear. If an animal serves a specific purpose for its disabled owner, then it is by default a service animal and there is no corroborating documentation required. If people choose to disobey the law and falsely represent their pets as service animals, then the natural course of things will inevitably intervene in their lives in regards to punishment for their transgression. Do NOT punish the disabled in order to dissuade the non-disabled from breaking the law. We in the disability haul along more than enough excess baggage in our lives. An additional doctor visit to get a letter written confirming that there is a legitimate need for a service animal is both ciostly and punitive. At the very least, if the airlines require documentation it should never leave the hands of the service animal's owner, and the airline should be required to pay for the visitto the doctor's office, for any charge for writing the letter, and any transportation costs incurred as well as compensating the disabled person for their time spent in getting the requested documentation.",,,,,,,

Suggestion: Let persons who need service dogs get a secure photo-ID card, like a driver's license, that lets them board with their dogs.

These new restrictions on Psychiatric Service Dogs is discriminatory and uncalled for. There has been no real evidence to support discriminating against people for their disability. 
 
Psychiatric disabilities effect your physical body just as much as any other disability might. For instance, when I am in a depressive state all my joints ache, get stiff, and lock up or collapse under me for no reason. This can be very dangerous if I were crossing the street or train tracks by my house or walking with my children or going up or down stairs. My service dog is trained to brace me just like for someone with a physical disability. However, the reason for this task is totally psychiatric. 

On the opposite end of the spectrum when I am in a manic state I get major PTSD flashbacks and have run into traffic many times because I thought I was being chased and nearly got run over by a car. My dog is trained to block me from walking into traffic similarly to how a guide dog is trained to do the same thing. 

These are just a couple of examples. My service dog is trained to provide me with 12 different tasks as well as different types of work such as deep pressure stimulus, tactile stimulus, and others. My dog has as much training as any other kind of service dog. Psychiatric service dogs are held to a high standard and we all strive to make our dogs as invisible as possible. 

By requiring these handlers who use psychiatric service dogs to provide 48 hour notice and a doctors letter, you are going to be effecting many people such as soldiers coming home from war with PTSD, and abuse victims. My conditions are 90% hereditary. If my mother knew about Psychiatric Service Dogs, she might still be alive today. She died from Bipolar three years ago in a very violent death. I did not ask to be given these conditions, but now I am being punished for it. What if I need to go to a funeral?",,,,,,,

If it were truly to keep people from falsely claiming that their pets are service animals, it would be a requirement for all service animals.  With this regulation in place, all someone has to do, to fake a service animal, is claim to have any other disability.  Since many disabilities are invisible, to a casual observer, when the individual is not having an episode, they will probably get away with it.  Some examples of disabilities, that service dogs are commonly used for, and do not require a doctor's note, according to this regulation are diabetes, epilepsy, allergies, and asthma.  A non-disabled person need only claim one of these disabilities, no proof is needed.  Mobility, blindness, and deafness, can also be faked, without too much difficulty.

This regulation has no other purpose than to send the message that the mentally ill are second class citizens.  It does this by violating their rights to travel freely from State to State, and violating their right to privacy.  The regulation will do irreparable harm to any law biding citizen, that requires a service animal.  If they need to travel for work, at a moment's notice, the are not allowed.  If they wish to be by the side of a dying loved one, they can't.  There is also no provision, or restriction on how this information is kept by the airlines, or who has access to it.  There is nothing to protect someone's prospective employer, or landlord from being able to access this information.  With the stigma that mental illness has, in spite of the fact that it, in many cases, does not affect their ability to do their job, or be a good tenant, they would most likely not be discriminated against, by the prospective employer, or landlord.",,,,,,,

To the Office of the Secretary,
 I write in strong support of the Psychiatric Service Dog Society (PSDS) petition: 
 ""Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel"". 
The current provision of the Department of Transportation’s Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) regulation (14 CFR Part 382) seriously concerns me with respect to the unequal treatment of persons suffering from a disability. As a biomedical research, working in the largest medical center of the country, it strongly concerns me that a clearly vulnerable group of individuals is  coerced into providing proof of their health status to unqualified personnel in a public space. The current provision is in clear violation of several laws regulating handling and storage of health data,  patient confidentiality (such as who has access to data) and others. I strongly doubt that airline personnel obtained  adequate training for this task. Also, the current provision does not outline what the airlines are doing with the letters. Are they stored, who has access and so on. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has clear rules as to how, who and where and for how long patient data can be stored. Airlines are clearly not equipped to store and/or access health care data.
The current provision discriminates specifically against one group of disability, namely persons suffering from mental disability such a post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or generalized anxiety disorder among many others.

From a constitutional point of view every individual should be treated equally by the ACAA. However, why is the group of persons suffering from mental disabilities singled out in  provision 14 CFR Part 382? The current provision does not require advanced notice and/or a  Doctor signed letter from persons suffering from physical disabilities such as a person in a wheel chair. Not that the current provision discriminates against a single group of individuals, it also makes life much harder for a group of Americans who are already disadvantaged such as war veterans suffering from PTSD and many others. 
In general, the access to public locations is regulated by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). However, only air-traffic is exempted from the ADA and is regulated by the ACAA. It is concerning as to why airlines need own regulations. However, this point is not part of the current debate, although it is indicative of the special treatment of the airline industry.  
Moreover, it is alarming that the current provision does not distinguish between psychiatric service animals  and emotional support animals. Psychiatric service animals, such as psychiatric service dogs, undergo specific and complex  training that most often is accompanied by a certification process of the animal. Conversely, emotional support animals are just regular pets without advanced training. Moreover, psychiatric service animals  fall under service animals as regulated by and outlined in the ADA. From the ADA point of view there is no distinction between  psychiatric service animals and emotional support animals. If the ACAA had adopted the essence of the ADA, then there would not be any debate necessary.

Scientifically speaking there is also no reason to treat psychiatric service animals and emotional support animals alike. For instance, psychiatric service dogs, a subgroup of psychiatric service animals, have been subject of various scientific publications [1-3]. On the other hand emotional support animals have not.
 The argument in the current provision as to why documentation is needed for mentally disabled individuals  is  superficial, discriminatory and lack's any scientific basis. 

 In conclusion, the current provision does discriminate against one group of individuals and need to be changed as it is clearly unconstitutional.

Under the ADA, a service dog is a dog that is individually trained to mitigate the disability of it's disabled handler.  That is any disability!  A service dog is guaranteed public access rights and is highly trained to behave appropriately in public.  ALL service dogs are equal under the ADA.  An emotional support animal is NOT individually trained to mitigate a disability, does not have public access training and is not recognized by the ADA.  A psychiatric service dog is a fully trained service dog and as many are owner trained, they are usually better trained than service dogs that help with other types of disabilities because the handler is very aware of their behavior.  To lump a fully trained service dog that is trained to mitigate the disability of it's handler in the same category as an untrained pet that a person is allowed to bring on the plane as an emotional support animal does not make any sense.  There is no comparison.  A service dog is a service dog, period!  Whether it is for someone who is visually impaired, hearing impaired, mobility impaired, for seizures, diabetes, autism, or a psychiatric condition, it is still a service dog.  The DOT claim that people are ""faking"" psychiatric service dogs not other types of service dogs is baseless.  Do you have any hard proof that this is happening?  I have heard of people putting on dark glasses and pretending to be blind to get their dog allowed on the plane as a service dog.  Honestly, if you were going to fake a disability to claim your dog was a service dog, would you fake a mental illness and tell airline personnel that you were mentally ill?  Especially in the world of post 9/11?  It would be so much safer to pretend you were epileptic or diabetic.  Please change this law so that all people with disabilities who utilize service dogs to mitigate their disabilities and try to live their lives in the best way possible are treated the same.",,,,,,,

Teddy is trained to alert me to the presence of other people, and he is trained to stay between me and other people or the doorway. In a situation like the bank line, he is trained to lay behind me.

In my opinion singling out one group of Service Dog handlers is highly discriminating. 
In the light of the modern scientific research drawing a line between ""mental"" and "" physical"" illness - disability - is not appropriate anymore, the roots of mental illness are physiological (changes in function of the brain) and so are the symptoms. There is no logical reason to draw a line between service dogs assisting a person during seizures and flashbacks or panic attacks (both manifesting themselves as host debilitating physical symptoms).
The Department seeks for examples on how service dogs for people with mental health disabilities differ from emotional support animals. Service Animals are trained to perform specific work or tasks mitigating handlers' disability. A good examples are dogs alerting and/or assisting during panic attacks (a common symptom of, for example, the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). Their function is no different than that of SDs assisting people during seizures or low/high blood sugar episodes. Panic attacks, as many other debilitating symptoms of mental illness, can occur anytime, including a flight or time at the destination.
I would like to comment on the ADA analogy. The Department believes that air travel differs substantially from other places of public accommodation. This is not necessary the case. Cruise ship and train travel are both governed by ADA and also involve people confined in a space for prolonged time intervals. 

To conclude: I support the solution number 4: documentation and advance notice should be eliminated for all types of SERVICE ANIMALS. As ESAs are NOT RECOGNIZED as service animals (in the community involved, the society in general and the ADA) the rules should remain unchanged in their case. This is the only solution that will help to avoid the confusion and discrimination.",,,,,,,

I support  the appeal of sections 382.117(e)  and  382.27(c)(8)  of the May 2008 Final Rule of the ACA Act which  places advance notification and documentation standards on the users of PSD but do not support such an appeal in referene to ESAs/comfort animals.
2. The above sections clearly violate existing Federal law and standards by discriminating against handlers with PSD. With reference to PSD and  PSD's only, I suggest the elimination of the Advance Notification and Documentation requirements for handlers of psychiatric service animals.
3. I share the department's concern re fraud and abuse of service dog access since such abuse could impact on access policies and availability.  However the department has shown neither empirical or ancedotal evidence that abuse exists and is of such a magnitude it would require such ononerous limitation on the rights of the disabled.  I  realize that air travel does bring with it additional concerns of safety and in these days security that is not usually presented in access issues. Still there should be at a minimum a showing of substantial, substantive evidence that unusual restrictions are necessary and would accomplish the desired result.
DOT has not shown the need for the discrimination they have put in place or the need for Fraud detection they are requesting and until they do so there is no rationale for developing these policies.  I join in the recommendation that DOT do a five year study on the issue of the existence and frequency of fraud and abuse related to service dog access. DOT could require the airlines to collect statistics about   ( 1 ) the number of assistance dogs traveling and ( 2 ) what percentage presented problems and ( 3 )what percentage was documented as fraud or (4 ) attempted fraud or ( 5 ) suspected fraud.

The ADA of 1990 clearly states the definition of a service dog and makes it clear that a service dog is individually trained to mitigate a disability, INCLUDING A PSYCHIATRIC DISABLITY! A PSD is legally protected and has been trained and is allowed public access. A PSD is a service dog, just like a seeing-eye dog, a hearing dog, a seizure alert dog or a mobility dog. A PSD is highly trained both to mitigate the disability of the handler and to behave in public. If you ask the handler of a seeing eye dog, hearing dog, mobility dog or any other type of service dog, they will also tell you that their dog provides many therapeutic functions that are also performed by PSD, ESA and pets.  I have a friend with a seeing-eye dog and he will tell you the that the dog is his best friend, that he calms him, makes hiim feel better, etc.  It is the very nature of the human/animal bond.  That is not the ONLY thing a PSD provides, as ATA has given examples of in their comment.
An ESA is an untrained pet that a passenger feels they need and gets a doctors note to be allowed to bring on the plane. I
Another clea?distinction between the two, putting it in plain terms. PSD and all other SD have full access to all areas of the airport covered by the ADA.  ESA do not. Therefore, ESA would have to follow the rules for pets everywhere except on the airplane and the other areas governed by DOT, not ADA. In these comments, the ATA clearly states that there is a problem with people faking other disabilities too, yet the DOT has claimed that one of the reasons it has implemented this discriminatory rule is because people fake PSD and not other types of SD. PSD are SERVICE DOGS, just like Guide Dogs, hearing dogs, Autism dogs, Medical alert/response dogs, mobility dogs and all other types of service dogs.

Re: docket number [OST-2009-0115]

The TIGER funds sound like an ideal opportunity to start rebuilding the national
transport grid using lightweight guideway and US-produced components. 

I hope the requirement for rapid job creation doesn't rule out R&D and pilot
projects altogether. My fear is that in the name of job ""creation"" we will spend
money just to pay people to do something. 100 M$/year ""creates"" 20,000 jobs
instantly even if it is used to build monoliths in the desert, but of course
those jobs don't outlast the grant. So the emphasis ought to be on lasting jobs,
which could be a conflicting requirement with the requirement of rapidly created
jobs.

Since there is apparently no anti-waste criterion in the funding, it looks like
expensive urban rail projects would qualify, even if they can only be justified
on questionable arguments like TOD creation and quality of life. At the same
time, advanced transit projects using lightweight guideways such as PRT might
not qualify because of the lead time required to complete a pilor project,
safety certification, and so on. If the advanced system is many times more
economically efficient (which needs to be part of the analysis), then the
criteria should lean in their favor.

(January 2009) but is not yet in there because CDOT refuses to add a project into 
the STIP until AFTER it has received state or federal funding award. This seems to 
conflict with the draft TIGER federal requirements on p. 23231 which essentially 
say that the project should already be listed in the state's STIP/TIP (e.g., listed on 
http://testimony.ost.dot.gov/ARRAcerts/) or that the applicant needs to submit ""a 
certification from the appropriate agency that the project will be included in the 
relevant planning document prior to award of a TIGER Discretionary Grant.""  
I bring this to FTA's attention so that our TIGER application is not 
incorrectly ""graded down"" because of what appears to be the circularity in the 
state vs. federal rules/procedures.  CDOT ranked our project highly in terms of 
importance for funding and they have provided written communication saying they 
will add my project into the STIP quickly, after we receive any federal funding 
award notices. To accomodate our situation and others in Colorado, the Town of 
Avon requests that the final TIGER rules are changed to allow the project to either 
already be in the STIP or e.g., ""...be able to be added to the state STIP or other 
relevant planning document within 30 days of receipt of award"".  (This was how the 
TIGGER grant program handled this problem.)

The Central Connecticut Regional Planning Agency (CCRPA), the designated 
Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for central Connecticut, would like to 
comment on Docket No. OST-2009-0115, ""TIGER Discretionary Grants.""

CCRPA is concerned that the definition of ""Eligible Applicants"" under this and 
other ARRA programs (including High-Speed Rail/Intercity Passenger Rail) is too 
narrow. In particular, the list of ""Eligible Applicants"" proposed leaves out 
Metropolitan Planning Organizations. This omission is a problem. MPOs play a 
pivotal role in transportation, and not just in planning. Many MPOs have developed 
the capacity to and actively implement projects. MPOs' regional, multimodal 
perspective makes them the ideal parties to carry out the plans they developed.

Omitting MPOs from the Eligible Applicants creates an unnecessary disconnect 
between project planning and project implementation and reduces the likelihood 
that regional transportation projects are executed in a manner that is both swift 
and true-to-plan. Omitting MPOs will also unnecessarily limit the parties who can 
apply to the Tiger Discretionary Grants program, as well as the number of projects 
that would be eligible under the program. If intent of the program is to stimulate the 
economy, such constraints may be counterproductive. Many MPOs have lists of 
sound, shovel-ready projects they are eager to implement. All that lacks is funding.

For these reasons, CCRPA would like to ask that MPOs be expressly included in 
the list of Eligible Applicants for the TIGER Discretionary Grants as well as other 
similar programs. The federal government provides MPOs with funding to develop 
regional plans and projects; if it would like to see those plans and projects made a 
reality in the most efficient and expeditious manner possible, it would make sense 
to allow them to apply to the TIGER Discretionary Grant program.

Thank you for your consideration.

The County of Camden would be interested in pursuing the TIGER grants for 
improvements to our transportation system.  We are a very large county in 
southwest Missouri whose biggest industry is tourism.  Because of the economic 
crisis that the country is in we have had to make budget cuts as have many 
agencies over the last 1-1/2 years.

Because of these budget cuts our transportation infrastructure has suffered.  The 
roads that we have paved are beginning to fall apart and the remaining roads we 
have are gravel and in need of upgrading.

We are requesting assistance in obtaining help for our ailing infrastructure.  I will 
send in an application submittal by the required deadline.

Thank You for your assistance.

We would like to improve our asphalt roads to a higher standard and our heavily 
traveled gravel roads upgraded with a hard surfacing.  We would not be able to do 
all of this work with our crews so we would have to obtain bids from contractors to 
perform the majority of this work, which would put more people to work in our area.",,,,,,,

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the criteria for the TIGER 
Discretionary Grant program.  The City of Mesa is very interested in the TIGER 
program and the opportunity to work with the Federal government to promote 
investment in regionally significant infrastructure projects that will provide for long-
term benefits, create jobs and revitalize the economy.

After careful review, the City suggests that consideration be given to placing 
greater emphasis on connecting transportation modes to regionally significant 
public facilities.  Connecting modes such as freeway corridors to link directly to 
other modes such as airports that provide commercial passenger and cargo 
service will greatly facilitate the development of regional employment centers.

In our view, seamless multimodal transportation networks provide a platform for 
business development and job creation.  Such interconnectivity between modes 
provides businesses with superior speed and agility and the most efficient supply 
chain management to better distribute their products.  This will serve as a magnet 
for the growing number of companies that are dependent on time-critical, high-
value manufacturing and perishable distribution.

Once again, the City of Mesa greatly appreciates the opportunity to comment on 
the TIGER Discretionary Grant criteria and we look forward to working with you on 
this exciting program.

The North Carolina Department of Transportation respectfully submits the following 
comments on ths subject Docket:

1.  The Summary of the Rule states that "" … the Department may award funds 
based on the initial applications without publishing a supplemental notice.""  The 
Rule also states that the supplemental notice, if necessary, will be published on or 
before June 17, 2009.  The combination of these statements implies that awards 
may be granted prior to June 17, 2009.  In such case, applicants may be applying 
based on this Rule, not knowing whether the application requirements or selection 
criteria will be modified through a supplemental notice.

We respectfully request that clarification be made as to whether applications will 
be accepted prior to June 17, 2009.  Perhaps the Rule could expressly state the 
date beyond which applications may be submitted.

2.  The Summary of the Rule states that "" … the Department may award funds 
based on the initial applications without publishing a supplemental notice.""  The 
Rule also states that the supplemental notice, if necessary, will be published on or 
before June 17, 2009.   The combination of these statements implies that awards 
may be granted prior to June 17, 2009.  Continuing, the Summary states that ""… 
the Department will evaluate all applications and announce the projects that have 
been selected to receive Grant Funds as soon as possible after the Application 
Deadline, but no later than February 17, 2010.""  Since the Application Deadline is 
clearly September 15, 2009, please clarify if awards may be made before the 
Application Deadline.

3.  The Rule clearly expresses the desire to award funds to projects with national 
or regional significance and benefit.  It is likely that those projects with the 
greatest national or regional significance will be large.  These larger projects will 
also be the most challenging to complete prior to February 2012.

As such, we respectfully request that the Application Deadline be advanced,  
perhaps to August 1, 2009, to provide additional time to deliver these large 
nationally or regionally significant projects prior to February 2012.

4.  The Rule requires a ""well-developed analysis of expected benefits and costs 
…"".  The Rule also requests comments on the methodology for such an analysis 
and further states that, after the comment period, the ""DOT will publish more 
detailed guidance on the analysis required…""

We request clarification as to whether an application submitted prior to the 
issuance of this further guidance can be amended to reflect the requirements of 
any further guidance.

5.  The Rule states that if the current solicitation does not result in the award and 
obligation of all available funds, that a subsequent solicitation may be proffered.  

In the event that funds are awarded to an applicant to a lesser amount than 
requested, please clarify as to whether the successful applicant can respond to 
any future solicitation for the purpose of acquiring additional TIGER funds for the 
same project partially funded previously.

Washington, DC   20590

Docket Number OST-2009-0115

The City of Boise, Idaho, and Capital City Development Corp. (CCDC), Boise's 
redevelopment agency, intend to apply for a TIGER Discretionary Grant (Docket 
No. OST-2009-0115) to provide gap financing for the Downtown Boise Streetcar 
project currently in development. The city and CCDC offer the following comments 
on the Interim NOFA:

1. At least $300 million in the TIGER Discretionary Grant program should be 
dedicated uniquely for ""ready-to-go"" streetcar projects. Streetcars are a low cost 
transportation alternative which help address concerns about greenhouse gas 
emissions and the nation's dependence on foreign oil. They attract economic 
development, promote infill density and provide pedestrian-friendly mixed-use 
neighborhoods. Streetcars inherently capture all of the primary objectives of the 
ARRA and the TIGER program, yet of all forms of surface transportation 
infrastructure streetcars have been chronically unfunded or under-funded at the 
federal level. A set-aside of a significant portion of the TIGER program for 
streetcars would mean that they would not be judged in competition with other 
surface transportation projects.

2. Streetcar projects should not be judged under current New Starts/Small Starts 
rules, which are in direct conflict with the stated TIGER Discretionary Grant 
ranking criteria that emphasize long-term outcomes and job creation/economic 
stimulus. Currently under the Small Starts program, a project must have an overall 
rating of ""medium"" to be approved for federal funding and, in accordance with the 
language in the SAFETEA LU Technical Corrections Act, the FTA must 
give ""comparable but not necessarily equal"" weight to all of its criteria (supportive 
land use, economic development) in the evaluation process. An April 2005 Dear 
Colleague letter authored by FTA Administrator Jenna Dorn has unfairly 
discriminated against streetcar projects under the Small Starts program by 
requiring that projects must receive at least a ""medium"" cost effectiveness rating, 
which trumps the other criteria, before FTA will recommend a streetcar project for 
funding.  DOT should repeal the April 2005 Dear Colleague letter. This would clear 
the way for DOT to fund Small Starts streetcar projects through the TIGER 
process. 

3. The current FTA authority to award grants (in Section 5309 monies) up to $25 
million that are exempt from FTA rules, procedures and process should be 
explicitly invoked for streetcar projects in the TIGER program. Requiring 
compliance with typical FTA rules is too expensive and time consuming for most 
streetcar projects to be competitive in a grant program. Exempting streetcars from 
typical compliance would more closely meet the objectives of the TIGER program. 
The TIGER program should fund ""exempt"" streetcar projects that are already in 
development and require less than $25 million in federal funding. 

4. Additionally, streetcars that run in existing streets with other vehicular traffic 
should be categorically exempt from NEPA requirements. These streetcars would 
operate in roadways that are already in compliance with environmental 
regulations; streetcars do not add any negative environmental impacts (and in fact 
have been shown to provide certain positive impacts in air quality, resource 
consumption and traffic congestion.) 

Thank you for this opportunity to comment.

published 18 May 2009 (74 FedReg. 2326). 
        I have been engaged in nation-wide project development for many years in
this area of operations. My comments reflect that experience and may have some
impact on regional projects currently under development
	Context: The statutory context that underlies the proposed rulemaking is the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (HR-1) or ARRA (hereinafter,
referenced as). Our comments focus on the enabling the Secretary and the US
Department of Transportation modals to achieve the purposes and intent of the
law; and, our comments distinguish these purposes from the objectives of the
normal Federal budgetary process enacted annually by the Congress. 
	Summary: The underlying purposes of ARRA differ from those of the normal
budgetary process. ARRA is designed to inject immediate funding assistance to
the economy of the United States during a time of urgency. Thus, ARRA
establishes numerous  time limits for Executive Branch action. The DOT proposed
rulemaking is in support of an area of spending to be authorized at the
discretion of the Secretary of Transportation. The Congress identifies the
purposes and intent of the legislation to,
 (1) To preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery, 
(2) To assist those most impacted by the recession.
(3) To provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring
technological advances in science and health. 
(4) To invest in transportation, environmental protection, and other
infrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits. 
(5) To stabilize State and local government budgets, in order to minimize and
avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive state and local tax
increases. 
	We can assume that the Congress established these principles in priority order
given the objectives of the legislation. Thus, we encourage DOT to re-examine
its proposed rulemaking to reflect these very explicit priorities. We do not
believe that the proposed rules support either the Congress’ short term
objective or the core purposes of the Act. The proposed rulemaking does not
reiterate the ARRA objectives faithfully; and, it injects objectives outside of
the intent of the Congress and inconsistent with statutory dictates:
	The second priority, “To assist those most impacted by the recession” becomes
diminished. Of greater importance under the proposed rulemaking is, “To invest
in transportation infrastructure…” which is not a faithful recitation of the
statute and not the mandated second priority of the legislation. We recommend
that the third priority be restored to second place, as stated in the
legislation and that DOT act accordingly. Further, third and forth priorities
should be re-stated according to the statute, in accord with DOT’s various
mandates. Indeed, the last priority, in the notice of proposed rulemaking is not
even mentioned and, as we shall explain later, has become its first priority:
“To stabilize State and local government budgets.” 
	Given the language of the statute, the Congress has further required that DOT
establish a special context by which these funds will be distributed and
monitored. Thus, we conclude that, given the time sensitivity of delivery, that
the normal DOT regulatory environment may not necessarily apply, absent any
requirement to do so by the Congress. Accordingly, we encourage DOT to
re-examine its proposed rulemaking to eliminate any unnecessary attempt to
re-contextualize its implementation in the past regulatory frameworks that may
not be appropriate or fully consistent with the intent of the Congress and which
may extend the time of delivery or  evaluation of proposals. While the proposed
rulemaking attempts to achieve that objective, it does not fully implement the
intent of the Congress. Accordingly, we have discussed herein a few of what we
believe to be variances for immediate attention and as a framework for revision.
Essentially, we do not believe that ARRA empowers DOT to act outside of the
regulatory environment, but that it is empowered to take exception to past
requirements in light of the purposes that ARRA enunciates.
	Proposed Regulatory Provisions:
I.	Background: Statutory provisions should be reiterated (See, Summary
Provisions, above). The President did NOT sign such a bill into law that takes
exception to provisions enacted by the Congress. Thus, those provisions should
be faithfully reiterated in the context of the proposed rulemaking language.
 Subsidy/Administrative Costs: The language of the act provides that $200m shall
be available “for the purpose of paying the subsidy and administrative costs of
projects eligible for federal credit assistance…” The agency should specify its
findings and if it intends to use these funds as authorized or if the Secretary
has made another determination.
II.	Selection Criteria: Again the Department is in error in its recitation of
the provisions of the act, recast as selection criteria. Long-term outcomes,
while commendable, is not an identified criteria under ARRA. It does not have a
higher criteria than “job creation”. The Department has made a serious error in
judgment by attempting to advance non-statutory criteria as part of its
selection criteria. ARRA is not a long-term solution for the economy. It is an
immediate response to the needs of the population CURRENTLY and adversely
effected. These are “short term” objectives not, “near term” and/or “long-term
objectives.” No explanation which the department might advance is sufficient to
overcome or supplant the intent of the Congress.
a.	Livability, sustainability, safety: criteria for these categories should be
compared to the immediate outcomes expected under ARRA. The impression given is
for long-term results. ARRA is designed for short-term solutions with possible,
but not mandatory long-term results.
b.	BCA: While the BCA approach may be desirable, it should not be holding as a
primary evaluative criterion. Areas and terms of reference such as greenhouse
gasses, water quality, etc. are all long-term consequences. Certainly, any
project identified should do no harm or have an adverse effect on any of these
areas. However, imposing a positive criterion or standard of measure is
unnecessary given the nature and size of these grants. It imposes an unnecessary
burden on applicants without immediate result. If the Department wants to use
this as an internal criterion it is free to do so. The applicant, however,
should not be so obligated.
c.	Project Performance Evaluations: Clearly, these criteria should be of primary
and distinguishing importance. They are primary ARRA objectives.
i.	Job Creation: Any project selected under this ARRA discretionary authority
MUST demonstrate and be liable for job creation. In most cases, infrastructure,
once created will NOT yield sustained employment. Applicants as a mandatory
criterion should be required to clearly demonstrate sustained employment by
short-term project efforts that will not terminate with the completion of the
project. Thus, short-term construction or similar employment, while important is
not a prime ARRA objective.
ii.	Business Assistance: provisions in these areas reiterate old and ineffective
approaches to DBE, SDVOB, and SB program past failures. As in most past DOT
programs, we expect that the DBE, SDVOB, and SB community will continue to be
victimized by prime contractors and ineffective/outdated DOT review, protective,
and compliance procedures. This provision is purely palliative and should be
substantially revised. These protected classes are more negatively impacted than
any other class and should be accorded primary considerations and protections.
iii.	Project Schedule: ARRA funded projects and contractors should enjoy
expedited payment and strictly enforced prompt payment provisions.
iv.	Environmental Approvals: Absent any timely (30 day) agreement among the
numerous Federal and local environmental agencies to agree upon acceptable
solutions, DOT should assume jurisdiction and impose immediate and reasonable
solutions without delay.
v.	Legislative Approvals: Absent any timely (30 day) agreement among
legislative, municipal, and local authorities, DOT should assume jurisdiction
and be empowered to impose immediate and reasonable solutions without delay. DOT
should be empowered to impose any penalties for cost incurred on uncooperative
legislative/municipal/local participants.
vi.	Planning: Absent any timely (30 day) agreement among planning bodies, DOT
should assume jurisdiction and be empowered to impose immediate and reasonable
solutions without delay. DOT should be empowered to impose any penalties for
cost incurred on uncooperative planning participants.
vii.	Financial feasibility: Absent any timely (30 day) agreement among financial
review organizations, DOT should assume jurisdiction and be empowered to impose
immediate and reasonable solutions without delay. In such cases, DOT should make
provisions to demonstrate its competency in such areas or delegate this review
to areas of competency. Concerning financial feasibility, DOT should make
special provisions for bonding exemptions for DBE, SDVOB, and SB participants.
d.	Secondary Selection Criteria:
i.	Innovation: technology innovation is a separate category under ARRA. General
funding applicants should not be required to demonstrate technical innovation
unless this is the primary objective of the respective project. Hence, it should
not be a generalized and binding criterion.
ii.	Innovation Life Cycle: Here DOT provides preference for long-term projects,
which is inconsistent with ARRA. It should be substantially revised or removed.
iii.	Partnerships: Private-Public sector partnerships should be strongly
encouraged to enhance project funding and sustained job growth. This section
merits substantial improvement since it offers a considerable leverage potential
for the Federal grant investment from companion private investment. This section
should include attention to alternative areas of credit enhancement,
entitlement, appraisal, permitting, debt and investment instrument production
under proper supervision by competent financial oversight Federal agencies.
Municipal and State governments should be discouraged from competition with
private sector enterprises and required to engage in partnerships as the primary
mode of program development. With appropriate provisions – not contained herein
– ARRA provisions and funding leverage can be considerably enhanced for every
project, in every state. Moreover, private sector participation can assure
sustained employment beyond the completion of the project specific employment.
This is an area where preference should be given to SB, DBE, and SDVOB businesses.
e.	Program Specific Criteria: A preference for long-term projects and outcomes,
again is present and should be revised or eliminated as inconsistent with ARRA.
Specifically, the TIFIA evaluation scoring needs considerable revision to
reflect compliance with ARRA. For example, criterion (a) has no reference to job
creation! In an environment of limited credit availability, criterion (d) should
be adjusted given specific provisions of the act to the contrary. Criterion (g)
should be a DOT responsibility and not incumbent on the applicant to complete
DOT’s responsibility. Thus the provision should be eliminated. The TIFIA opinion
letter should be at the cost of the government, not the applicant; and, should
be, accordingly so clarified.
III.	Application Content: The $30,000 application is simply outrageous. Under
ARRA, the DOT receives millions to defray administrative expenses. Adding
additional fees is not found in ARRA and should be impermissible. Moreover, this
level of fee has a direct and adverse impact on DBE, SDVOB, and SB applicants.
Structurally, it means that only the largest can apply! This is completely
inconsistent with the problems ARRA attempts to redress. Indeed, DOT, at its own
expense should offer any certified DBE, SDVOB, and SB assistance to prepare a
submission. 
Summary: The DOT proposed rulemaking merits substantial revision. It focuses on
“big government” and “big business”. Moreover, it incorporates substantial and
negative regulatory baggage which have been proven ineffective for many years.
Finally, the proposed regulation imposes a standard that is in exception to the
intent of the Congress. Thus, the notice of proposed rule making is potentially
damaging to the core objectives of the legislation. Hence, I must urge DOT to
withdraw the proposed rules and program until they can be revised to meet
Congressional intent.

I-73 advocates continue to support completing the proposed interstate as a whole, 
believing completion of this interstate will spur economic activity, create jobs in 
areas with high unemployment rates, boost tourism and save lives.  

Economic Impact
It is estimated that I-73 could create thousands of jobs and draw new industry into 
some of the most economically depressed counties in South Carolina.   I-73 will 
also serve international commerce, as it potentially connects a major port 
(Charleston, SC) to the Canadian border.  Though I-73 does not travel to 
Charleston, discussions are underway to determine whether an inland port could 
be located in/near Marion, SC, enabling the South Carolina ports system to 
become truly intermodal.  If this is completed, I-73 runs in Marion, SC and would 
become a major thoroughfare of port distribution.

Tourism
National trends clearly indicate the need for improved roadways to facilitate future 
growth in the tourism industry.  While the more rural counties look to I-73 as an 
economic tool to draw business and industry, the Grand Strand can expect to 
expound on its product of tourism if the interstate is built, according to Dr. Donald 
Schunk, research economist at Coastal Carolina University.  Myrtle Beach and 
the rest of the Grand Strand in Horry County is the central cog in South Carolina’s 
top industry: tourism.  The area pumps about $15 billion year into the state’s 
economy.  Schunk said I-73 would allow for 100,000 or more visitors a year to 
Horry County’s beaches and estimated the additional visitors would spend $60 
million annually.  About 63 percent of Horry County’s employment is tourism-
related, according to the Myrtle Beach Regional Economic Development Corp.  
  
Safety
During the peak summer season, the Myrtle Beach area of South Carolina hosts 
as many as 500,000 visitors per day.  It is estimated that 94% of those visitors 
drive to the area and 70% of those drive-in visitors come from outside the state, 
traveling on I-95.  When combined with the permanent populations of Horry County 
(238,000) and Georgetown County (103,000) it is apparent that this region has in 
excess of 800,000 people daily.  In the event of a severe tropical storm or a 
hurricane, it will take 2-3 days to evacuate the coastal area.  If a storm were to 
strengthen, speed up and/or change course, 2-3 days may not be available.  Lives 
could be lost, due to the fact that the area is primarily dependent upon one 
evacuation route: Highway 501, a local thoroughfare that is 4-lane and not 
sufficient to evacuate such large numbers of people.

continuing growth of the Grand Strand. The TIGER grant program would provide 
the financing necessary to build the Interstate 73 (a High Priority Corridor #5 in 
ISTEA which remains an uncompleted national priority) project. The project will 
reside in 3 counties in northeastern South Carolina where average unemployment 
is more than twice the national average. This interstate will also extend the 
national interstate system to Myrtle Beach, SC, the nation’s busiest vacation 
destination without interstate access.  

 A TIGER grant will allow the project to make considerable progress on the 
ground, creating jobs that are badly needed.  

Major benefits of I-73 include job creation, both from construction of the road and 
surrounding economic development, in nearby areas that are economically 
distressed. Another benefit is improved safety, especially for hurricane 
evacuations from the South Carolina coast, and economic growth of the nation’s 
busiest vacation destination without interstate access.  

A significant portion of this road has already been built using local tax collections, 
and the State of South Carolina has made a recurring investment to I-73 every 
year for the past five years. With so much state and local funding already invested 
in this project, the USDOT should give serious consideration to funding Interstate 
73 in South Carolina through a TIGER grant.

The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority would like to comment on Docket 
No. OST-2009-0115, TIGER Discretionary Grants.

1.  Section III.B describes the conditions under which a component of a project 
could be considered.   The Airports Authority recommends tht an engineering and 
design project be an eligible component of a project if it can be demonstrated that 
advancing the engineering and design would create positive economic impacts 
and jobs by advancing the project’s construction. 

2.  The Airports Authority also recommends that the Department consider the 
benefits of the advanced construction of the full project, not just the engineering 
and design phase.

3.  The Airports Authority recommends that transit projects being developed 
without the use of Section 5309 funds (New Starts and Small Starts), still be 
considered eligible transit projects.  

4.  The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority is a public body created by an 
interstate compact between the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of 
Virginia.  It wishes to apply for funds even though its project is not in the approved 
State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) and is not being funded with 
state funds.  Note that the Airports Authority’s Chief Executive Officer, rather than 
the Governor of Virginia, signed the Airports Authority’s Section 1511 certification 
for an application for funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 
2009 Public Transportation Capital Investment Grants Program Appropriation and 
Allocations. 

5.  The Airports Authority concurs in the comments of Jennifer Strehler of Avon, 
Colorado, and Sherry Bohnert Earley of Hampton Roads, Virginia, with regard to 
the requirement that the project be in the State Transportation Improvement Plan.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment and for your consideration.

Sincerely yours,
Philip G. Sunderland

Project 
development is an area of practice. Thus, I am submitting comments to the DOT 
proposed rules published at its DOCKET # OST-2009-0015.
    The proposed rules raise some general questions that require more careful 
attention on the part of the US Department of Transportation. Clearly, the 
Department is attempting to provide project funding in a manner consistent with the 
intent of the Congress and the express purposes of the Stimulus Act -- American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It simply did not come out that way; and, 
DOT should re-examine these efforts before finalizing its rules and funding process.
    In general, the proposed rules tries to provide some preferences that have 
always been on DOT's books. They are simply not part of the Recovery Act. The 
Recovery Act or ARRA is designed as a quick fix, not a long-term solution. Long-
term solutions are a part of the normal budgetary process, repeated annually. The 
Recovery Act seeks to put people back to work quickly and stimulate local 
economy. Moreover, in many of the areas of funding, normal processes are waived. 
The DOT provisions of ARRA are no different. Instead, DOT has incorporated its old 
baggage in the guise of fulfilling Congressional intent. Nothing could be further from 
the truth if you read the fine print.
    Here, I am not going to provide a complete laundry list of problems. However, 
key and at the top of the list are the priorities expressed by the Congress and their 
implementation. DOT simply does not repeat and corrupts those priorities in its 
proposed rules! As Congress provided a statutory blue print, so to MUST the DOT 
seek to implement the will of the Congress. That's simply how the Constitution 
works.
    There are a few ""wool over the eyes"" attempts in the homage to the DBE -- 
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise -- program. Knowing that the program has 
serious flaws, DOT simply repeats, rather than improves the approach. Keep in 
mind that the ARRA is focused on small business. The DBE program, however, 
counts small businesses as victimized by large construction firms. This isn't any 
surprise. Incorporating a reference to such a flawed program without any 
improvement is, at best, ingenuous.
    During these times, when recovery efforts need to be focused on short-term 
results, DOT opts for long-term effects, broad consequences, policy mumbo jumbo, 
etc. We need to put workers back to work and offer small business opportunity. 
These rules do not accomplish that objective of the act even in this small, 
discretionary program.
    Finally, partnership programs should be strongly encouraged. They hold the 
promise of leverage for our tax payer dollars and sustained growth. This area needs 
very considerable redrafting.
    Thus, I do not believe that DOT has operated in the best interest of the public, 
the government, or the will of the Congress. Rather, it has created a program that 
was not intended by the Congress which will inevitably reward the ""old guard"" of 
large business and competitive local governments.
    I recommend that DOT personnel, first re-read the Constitutionl; and, second, 
revise this document so that it serves the will of those who the public elected and 
are empowered to express the will of the people.",,,,,,,

Re: Docket No. OST-2009-0115

Dear Secretary LaHood: 

The New Jersey Department of Transportation submits the following comments 
regarding the project selection criteria and guidance for awarding TIGER 
Discretionary Grants.

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) should be the lead for the freight rail 
projects that the U.S. Department of Transportation selects.  The FRA has 
established policies and procedures geared to deliver freight rail projects.  Utilizing 
the FRA will make the delivery of the freight rail projects more efficient.

To insure the right balance of worthwhile projects, covering a range of modes, 
priority should not be limited to those completed by February 17, 2012; instead 
priority should include those projects that can be substantially completed by that 
date.  Giving priority to projects completed by February 17, 2012 risks jeopardizing 
otherwise significant and worthwhile projects that will be substantially completed 
by that date.

Thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to comment.

Sincerely, 


Stephen Dilts
Commissioner, New Jersey Department of Transportation

The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) offers the following 
comments in response to the May 18, 2009, United States Department of 
Transportation (US DOT) Interim Notice of Funding Availability for Supplemental 
Discretionary Grants for Capital Investments in Surface Transportation 
Infrastructure Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Request 
for Comments on Grant Criteria:

General Comments:

In general, Caltrans is supportive of US DOT in its efforts to ensure that the 
Transportation Investments Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program can 
have a lasting effect on increasing national competitiveness and improving the 
economy, especially through advancing projects that improve freight mobility. 

In discussion with its State and National partners, we note that there has been a 
general theme of response that the proposed grant criteria are vague and exceed 
existing requirements for similar programs under United States Code Titles 23 and 
49.  We concur with this theme especially as expressed in terms of lack of 
specificity for calculating direct and indirect job creation and how US DOT will 
weight long-term outcomes.  

We concur with the formal comments on this docket provided by the American 
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.  In addition, some of 
our partners have noted and we agree that the proposed criteria should give 
greater priority to projects that leverage local, state, and private sector funding, 
and/or can be delivered rapidly.  

The purposes of the TIGER program is similar to the existing Projects of National 
and Regional Significance Program (PNRS), and most of the proposed eligible 
projects fall within the scope of existing state and metropolitan planning and 
program requirements.  In the case of the PNRS, US DOT has already published 
final regulations that established a more flexible application and selection process 
that is sufficient to allow competitive selection for the same types of projects that 
are eligible for funding under the TIGER program.  For the most part, these 
existing regulations focus on project viability in terms of its completion of existing 
planning, programming, and financial requirements.  Using them as the basis for 
the TIGER program criteria would expedite the selection process and reduce the 
complexity of the proposed application process.

Cost Benefit Analysis Requirements:

The proposed grant criteria require applicants to estimate a project’s expected 
benefits in the five long-term outcomes.   Cost benefit analyses are an effective 
way to determine the relative value of individual proposals, especially in highly 
competitive programs.  However, as proposed, the proposed requirements exceed 
the limitations of these types of analyses, especially when applied to vaguely 
described primary selection criteria for the Livability, Sustainability, and 
Competitiveness Long-Term Outcomes.  If US DOT is to retain these criteria and 
process, then it should either be more specific in defining criteria, or specify that 
in the above-mentioned cases, a qualitative description would suffice.

Certification Requirements:

The requirements are very clear in specifying who is responsible for providing 
Section 1511 certifications for projects that are included in the Statewide 
Transportation Improvement Program (STIP).   It would be beneficial for this 
section to clearly identify who is responsible for projects that are not included in 
the STIP, especially if they funded from sources other than those under State or 
Local control.

Document ID  DOT-OST-2009-0115-0001  
Document Title  Funding Availability; Request for Comments on Grant Criteria: 
Supplemental Discretionary Grants for Capital Investments in Surface 
Transportation Infrastructure, etc.  

My name is John Fox and I'm writing on behalf of the Seattle Displacement 
Coalition, a 30 year community advocacy organization here in Seattle to comment 
on grant criteria for supplement discretionary grants for capital investments in 
Surface Transportation Infrastructure.  I'm also writing on behalf of a larger 
coalition of over 16 community, small business, and democratic party 
organizations and over 100 community leaders opposed to the use of federal 
stimulus monies (TIGER funds in this case) for Seattle's Mercer Corridor Project.  

Already the Mercer Corridor project is 100 million dollars over original cost 
projections and the City is simply seeking to alter criteria you use for granting 
these funds so they can secure these funds to cover cost overruns.  The Mercer 
Corridor Project also does not meet a real transportation need in Seattle and will 
actually make traffic congestion worse in the Eastbound Direction. The project is 
located in Seattle's South Lake Union - it is home to developer Paul Allen's plans 
for a biotech hub in this area - and merely serves as a beautification project to 
enhance land values in this growing area.  I've attached a letter identifying coalition 
members opposed to this project.

The City of Seattle will be seeking 50 million of TIGER funding for this project and 
it does not meet grant criteria for receipt of these funds.  

Regarding criteria for use of these stimulus funds, economic recovery monies 
must serve a purpose in this case a real transportation purpose which this 
application does not but most important of all, these funds are designated 
for ""economically distressed areas"". We want to emphasize that this must remain 
the highest priority and key criteria for use of these stimulus monies. 

In order to skirt this key requirement, and you may check the Seattle City Council 
record Monday June 1st 930 AM Council Briefing, our City has asked you to de-
elevate the importance of this criteria and instead give priority to ""economically 
growing areas"".  This is a clear attempt to skirt the key criteria and direct funds 
precisely where they are not needed in Seattle and for a project that will do 
nothing to reduce traffic congestion in our city as indicated by 3 independent and 
even city sponsored studies.  It's simply a beautification project serving one large 
development company and aimed at moving traffic away from his key waterfront 
properties.  Already, the State Legislature decided not to provide stimulus funding 
for the Mercer project precisely because it did not meet recovery act criteria.

In Seattle there are an identified 30 bridges in critical need of repair - many of 
them located in parts of SE and SW Seattle - truly low income and distressed 
areas.  This does not include a backlog of over one-half billion in road and street 
and sidewalk improvements mostly in these distressed communities. Yet our city 
will forgo seeking stimulus monies for these projects in favor of a 50 million dollar 
request for Mercer - primarily to serve the developer agenda of one man - Paul 
Allen - and his development company Vulcan Inc.  

We urge you to retain as your most important criteria for use of these funds - 
economically distressed communities. It would be a breach of the voters faith and 
the recovery act to do otherwise. Only these communities deserve these funds. 
Sadly our city doesn't seem to care and would abuse this program.  They are 
seeking to have you change criteria that would undercut the intent of these 
recovery funds.

officials:

Organizations and Community Leaders Opposed to Use of Stimulus Funds for 
Seattle’s Mercer Corridor Project

March 12, 2009

The Honorable Julia Patterson, Chair
Transportation Policy Board 
Puget Sound Regional Council
1011 Western Avenue 
Seattle, WA 98104

Dear Ms. Patterson:

As residents and community leaders from across Seattle, we are writing to 
strongly urge you to deny the City's $80 million dollar request for federal dollars for 
the ""Mercer Corridor Project"".  The City has submitted this request for at least 
that amount in federal funds drawn from the stimulus package now being initiated 
by the President Elect Obama. Our mayor is seeking these funds to fill a growing 
funding gap given that project costs have skyrocketed from $90 million four years 
ago to over $200 million today.

Earmarking monies for the Mercer project would represent a gross misuse of 
stimulus package dollars given that this plan does not address either a regional or 
local transportation need in our community. Under the Mayor's plan, Mercer would 
be widened and turned into a 2-way tree-lined boulevard where it runs through the 
South Lake Union Neighborhood between I-5 and the Seattle Center. Valley Street 
that now absorbs much of the westbound traffic from I-5 would be narrowed with 
that traffic funneled onto Mercer.  

City Council staff and the City's Department of Transportation (SDOT) have 
acknowledged that these costly changes will do absolutely nothing to reduce 
traffic congestion along that corridor and will at certain intersections make it 
worse. In fact, there are at least three studies now that have been done which 
confirm that this preferred two-way Mercer plan will exacerbate traffic problems in 
South Lake Union.  One study done as part of the preliminary environmental 
review cites delays of traffic by as much as 7-18 minutes in the eastbound 
direction if this plan is implemented. 

The Mayor's planners also have tried to argue that reconfiguring Mercer will help 
move traffic through downtown during State Route 99 and Alaskan Way Viaduct 
construction.  According to the City Council’s analysis, no research shows that 
the proposed changes will in any way alleviate congestion during this construction.

By contrast, in 2000, there was a plan preferred by the community and by our 
former Mayor Paul Schell that was called the ""small and simple"" fix which, if 
implemented, would have cost only $10 million (in 2000 dollars). That plan also 
would have done more to reduce congestion in the area, but it was dropped from 
consideration after our current Mayor took office and after the City sold all the 
properties along Mercer to billionaire Paul Allen.  
Put simply, today’s Mercer two-way alternative is a 'pork barrel' project that was 
devised to mesh with redevelopment plans now occurring in South Lake Union 
where Mercer is located. That plan is driven by Paul Allen's Vulcan development 
company which owns nearly 50% of all developable land in that area and 
especially along Mercer and Valley streets. The Mercer project is designed to 
redirect traffic away from Paul Allen's view properties located along Valley street 
closest to the lake and push it all on to Mercer - at a cost of over 200 million 
dollars (and climbing).  Paul Allen will also benefit when the City buys back land 
along Mercer he owns - now very expensive land the City sold to him only seven 
years ago at rock bottom prices.

This is precisely the kind of project the Obama administration has said they would 
not support for use of stimulus package dollars.  It also would be the wrong first 
step for the incoming administration to take, especially when there are so many 
real pressing transportation needs in our region with a price tag of over 15 billion 
dollars, including nearly a one billion dollar backlog of critical road, sidewalk, and 
bridge repairs in our city's neighborhoods.  These are the kinds of projects that 
desperately need these stimulus funds not the Mercer project. 

City engineers have identified 33 bridges in our neighborhoods in serious need of 
repair, some bordering on unsafe.  To preference Mercer over these needs strikes 
us as a serious breach of the voters' trust. These are projects that have been 
waiting years for promised dollars and meet the president elect's most important 
criteria for receipt of stimulus funds - they are shovel ready, i.e., ready for 
immediate start-up. By contrast, the Mercer Project faces months if not years of 
extensive environmental review and likely litigation due to community opposition. 

It's time to pull the plug on the Mercer project. Some of the constituent and 
neighborhood groups directly affected by the two-way Mercer plan that already 
have gone on record opposing it include:

economic importance to projects of regional and national importance.  The 
proposed I-73 Project is one of those projects.  This is because of the following 
reasons:

Myrtle Beach is the only major tourism destination in the nation that is not 
accessible by a direct national highwy.  It has thus not been able to develop 
appropriately to realize it's true economic potential.  

Further, this proposed road would run through 3 major counties of the State.  
These counties have the highest unemployment (double digits) in the State of 
South Carolina.  This national road would have a dramatic positive impact on the 
economic development of these counties and the current and future employment 
and health and well being of it's current and future residents.

Further the State has seen fit to designate it as a major road of significance to the 
State's economic development and the nation has designated it as a road of 
national significance.  The State has illustrated it's ongoing support of this project 
by provideing funds for it's planning, right of way acquisition and development each 
year for the last several years and is committed to providing what it must to make 
it a reality.

Lastly, this road is crucial to the health and well being of the area since it will also 
provide a method of escape for the hnudreds of thousand of residensts and 
hundreds of thousand of visitors during times of natural threats/disastors such as 
huricanes and thus should be funded not only for economic development purposes 
but for safety and health reasons as well!

For all of the above reasons it is respectfully requested that this project be funded 
ASAP!

Thanks for your consideration of funding this important project.",,,,,,,

facilitate significant projects of national significance, I would suggest and encourage that the 
regulations governing TIGER grants give priority status to those infrastructure projects which 
have heretofore been identified by the US Congress as Projects of Regional and National 
Significance.

One such project is Interstate 73, which is the shortest route between the manufacturing states 
of Michigan and Ohio and the warm-water ports of Savannah, GA; Charleston, SC; Georgetown, 
SC; and Wilmington, NC. It traverses the states of SC, NC, VA, WV, MI and OH, commencing 
in the East Coast's resort vacation mecca of Myrtle Beach and terminating at Sault Saint Marie, 
MI. Myrtle Beach is the Nation's only major resort destination, with approximately thirteen million 
visitors annually, without an interstate connection. Over the past significant federal funds have 
been allocated to this project across the corridor states, and in the last highway reauthorization 
bill it was identified by US Congress as a Project of Regional and National Significance, and has 
also been identified as one of the top five projects nationally. 

In South Carolina, the South Carolina General Assembly and the South Carolina Department of 
Transportation have identified as I-73 as the highest priority new road project in the state. This 
was reaffirmed by the South Carolina General Assembly in the last few weeks by concurring 
resolution which was recently forwarded to the attention of Secretary LaHood of the US 
Department of Transportation. The resolution also identifies the first phase of the project as the 
six mile segment between the ""Intersection of Hope"" at its' intersection with Interstate 95 in 
Dillon County, SC and US Highway 501. The starting point, the Intersection of Hope, is so 
named because of the dire economic situation of this region of South Carolina which has known 
some of the highest unemployment rates of all of South Carolina for years as a result of the 
regions' loss of mainstay industries, ie: tobacco farming and textile manufacturing. Today's 
unemployment rates in three of the four South Carolina counties that this highway traverses 
suffers from unemployment greater than twenty percent. Truly, the I-73 project is seen as a 
symbol of economic hope for those economically disadvantaged counties.

The first phase of construction of I-73 can commence upon completion of the wetlands 
mitigation for the project and final permitting, which SCDOT has opined should take no more 
than twelve months. Acquisition of right-of-way has commenced in the area of the first phase 
and should be complete within this same time frame.

South Carolina has financially committed its' financial resources toward construction of I-73 by 
annual allocation from our state budget and the approval of tolling as a state-match funding 
mechanism.

South Carolina's unemployment currently rank as the nations third worst. The chief economic 
driver of the state is tourism, with Myrtle Beach being the heart of that industry. With no 
interstate access, growth of tourism in Myrtle Beach is hamstrung due to choked highways 
leading to the coast, especially during the busiest tourist seasons. Such gridlock hampers 
tourist ingress and egress, as well as that of the labor pool that commutes hours every day from 
the aforementioned rural areas of the state. Without direct interstate access, Myrtle Beach is a 
disaster waiting to happen during periods of evacuation due to emergencies such as hurricanes. 
There is simply no easy way to move the hundreds of thousands of citizens and visitors over 
the existing road system in a timely manner between the declaration of an evacuation and a 
hurricane strike during peak tourist seasons.

My intent of this comment is two-fold: first, to preface an application by the state of South 
Carolina, and other states in the I-73 corridor, for TIGER grants in hopes that such applications 
will be granted by USDOT at the highest funding levels; and second, to encourage the 
establishment of regulations whereby infrastructure projects already identified by US Congress 
as Projects of Regional and National Significance be given priority access to TIGER grant 
funding.

Thank you for affording me this opportunity to comment.

RE: 	Docket Number OST-2009-0115
	Grants for Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery

Dear Secretary LaHood:

On behalf of North Texas Tollway Authority (“NTTA” or the “Authority”), I express 
the Authority’s support for the Grants for Transportation Investment Generating 
Economic Recovery (“TIGER Discretionary Grants”) program.  After a thorough 
review of the guidelines published in the Federal Register dated May 18, 2009, 
NTTA wishes to provide the Office of the Secretary of Transportation with 
comments.  Specifically, the Authority’s comments relate to the SH 161 Project 
(the “Project”) in the Dallas-Ft. Worth region in North Texas and the Authority’s 
work on the SH 161 Project with the TIFIA program over the last year.

The SH 161 Project, which is being developed as a partnership between NTTA and 
the Texas Department of Transportation (“TxDOT”), is an important regional project 
that will provide significant congestion relief.  The Project is currently shovel-ready 
and will be fully open to traffic in 2012 if financial close can be achieved in 2009.  
The project will provide immediate job creation and economic stimulus to the North 
Texas region and be an impetus to development along the new SH 161 corridor, in 
the heart of the DFW Metroplex.

The SH 161 Project is roughly a $1.5 billion project that requires an approximately 
$460 million TIFIA loan.  To further the Project, the Authority submitted a Letter of 
Interest (“LOI”) to the TIFIA program office on September 12, 2008.  We received 
positive feedback from TIFIA staff, a clear explanation regarding TIFIA’s limited 
resource for 2009 and subsequently, we have been periodically briefed about the 
status of TIFIA and Stimulus funding.  The TIFIA staff is fully familiar with the 
Project as it has gone through various development iterations; initially as a TxDOT 
Comprehensive Development Agreement (“CDA”) project (i.e. public-private 
partnership) and now as a public-public partnership between NTTA and TxDOT.  
NTTA believes this project strongly fulfills both the TIGER and TIFIA objectives.  
As TIFIA’s staff is aware, the proposed financing structure of the Project now 
incorporates support from TxDOT with a Toll Equity Loan that will likely result in a 
strong “AA” category credit rating for both the publicly sold debt and the TIFIA 
loan.  The Project would accordingly represent a very low risk, minimum credit 
charge for the TIFIA program.  NTTA has most recently received an Investment 
Grade Rating Indication letter and is now in a position to submit a fully completed 
TIFIA application.

The Authority’s understanding of the process for the TIGER program is that a new 
LOI would need to be submitted to the TIFIA program office, followed by the 
submission of both a TIFIA application and a separate TIGER application, both of 
which will not be accepted until roughly six weeks prior to the Application Deadline 
of September 15, 2009.  Receiving a TIGER and/or TIFIA allocation shortly after 
September 15 would fit within the Authority’s deadline with TxDOT for final project 
commitment by early 2010 and with our schedule to open the Project by 2012.  
However, the TIGER process, as currently proposed, will create significant 
difficulties for keeping the SH 161 Project on schedule.

Our current plans call for reaching a Project financial close by the end of October 
2009.  To line up the other financing components necessary for the Project to 
close it is imperative that we receive a preliminary indication of funding availability 
prior to the September 15 Application Deadline.  We are asking for a review of the 
proposed process as it seems inconsistent that a program specifically focused on 
shovel-ready projects to be completed by 2012 would require us to slow down and 
back-off an aggressive timetable to finance and complete this vital project.

Separately, the Authority understands the 2010 fiscal year TIFIA funding process 
may open up in the late summer.  While receiving a TIFIA loan through this 
process is also a possibility, delaying the start of the process to late summer will 
similarly hamper NTTA’s ability to achieve financial close in 2009.  The Authority is 
also aware that the TIFIA program office is considering allowing TIFIA applicants to 
pay their own credit charge through a premium payment at financial close – NTTA 
is interested in this option if it will help in gaining greater certainty to meet NTTA’s 
timeframe.  Working with TIFIA on multiple routes – TIGER; TIFIA 2010 fiscal year; 
TIFIA credit charge payment – simultaneously and receiving an indication during 
the summer that NTTA will receive a commitment through one of these options will 
provide the Project with certainty of being fully funded and will greatly aid in 
achieving financial close by our October 2009 target.

NTTA hopes to continue to bolster economic growth and job creation in the North 
Texas region with the development of the SH 161 Project.  Your support is critical 
in helping NTTA achieve this goal.

As the president of a regional employee training and development firm 
headquartered in Myrtle Beach, SC I must stress the importance of Interstate 73 
to the economic progress of this region.  Much attention has been given by the 
Obama Administration to workforce development initiatives as we work diligently 
to extricate ourselves from the current economic malaise.  I can think of no project 
with greater economic development and job-creating potential to this region than 
Interstate 73.  With our region facing double digit unemployment, the construction 
of Interstate 73 in South Carolina would not only create jobs during the 
construction phases, but serve as a long-term economic development tool for this 
region for many years to come.  Speaking from a personal perspective, the greater 
the level of economic activity in this region, the more opportunities I will personally 
have to hire new employees.  I am confident the construction of Interstate 73 in 
South Carolina will provide the economic impetus for my company to expand.

Mr. Secretary, as an entrepreneur and small business owner I am respectfully 
asking you to help me and my region create new jobs.  I respectfully ask and 
submit my comments in hopes that you will agree that the South Carolina portion 
of I-73 should qualify for the TIGER Discretionary Grants program.

Sincerely,

Via U.S. Government electronic docket site: www.regulations.gov

On behalf of the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program I am pleased 
to respond to the request for comments on the Interim Notice of Funding 
Availability for Supplemental Discretionary Grants for Capital Investments in 
Surface Transportation Infrastructure Under the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act.

The Brookings Metro Program is based on a simple premise: The United States is 
a metropolitan nation. Metropolitan areas are home to 83 percent of the U.S. 
population, 85 percent of the nation’s jobs and 92 percent of all college graduates. 
They are our hubs of research and innovation, our centers of human capital, and 
our gateways of trade and immigration. They are, in short, the drivers of our 
economy, and American competitiveness depends on their vitality.

The TIGER grants, with their explicit invocation of metropolitan areas in the interim 
notice, have tremendous potential to put the nation on a new path for 
transportation thinking and decision making.  We appreciate and recognize the 
significant effort and importance of the TIGER grants. To improve the value of the 
initiative we respectfully offer several recommendations.

1.  Provide more clarity and direction about the types of projects eligible for funding.

There needs to be much more clarity and a narrower definition about the types of 
projects eligible for TIGER grant funding. We applaud the program's purpose—as 
defined in the Recovery Act—to fund ""projects that will have a significant impact 
on the nation, a metropolitan area, or region."" For too long the federal program has 
not truly focused or lead in those areas where there are clear demands for national 
uniformity or else to match the scale and geographic reach of certain problems.

However, there appear to be little no limits on the types of projects that are eligible 
for TIGER grants. Opening the program up to all title 23 projects, for example, is 
potentially inconsistent with the desire for nationally/metro/regionally significant 
projects.
 
Restricting the grants to no less than $20 million may help avoid hyperlocal 
investments. Nevertheless, the broad eligibility criteria and potential waiver of the 
minimum level of grant funding could result in applications that include a range of 
projects that do not meet the department's perception of 'significant.' There should 
be a tighter connection between the evaluation criteria and the explicit goal for 
nationally/metro/regionally significant projects, and there should be more clarity 
about the conditions under which a waiver would be granted. Without which, the 
waiver provisions should be struck altogether.

2.  Reconsider a rigid requirement for benefit/cost analyses.

We associate ourselves with the comments submitted by Smart Growth America 
to ensure appropriate use of, and role for, benefit/cost analysis. At the Metro 
Program we have called strongly for comprehensive analyses of this sort.  It is 
astounding that formal benefit/cost considerations are not used and regular 
evaluations of outcomes are typically not conducted with respect to current 
transportation funding.

As an unfortunate byproduct, we are now unequipped to conduct such analysis in 
a routinized way. Credible data largely does not exist on the conditions, 
operations, and performance of our transportation network. And the tools that are 
employed today for tracking federal transportation spending and performance data 
are archaic and out of step with today’s needs.

Without solid data and information transportation decisionmaking is often made 
based on ideology. We are therefore concerned that the analyses—while well-
intended—may focus on traditional measures like travel time savings, number of 
passengers, or standard cost effectiveness. We strongly believe that outcome 
measures should go beyond these traditional metrics and consider the full range of 
impacts including the benefits of agglomeration and economic development, as 
well as the social and environmental costs of emissions like carbon. Without 
factoring the full scope of impacts, the economic benefits are likely to be 
overstated. A comprehensive British economic study found remarkable returns for 
certain projects when these impacts are considered. 

The automatic waiver for < $20 million projects should be struck. If these projects 
are to be included they should be held to the same standards as larger projects.

3. More forcefully make the connection between transportation and other policy 
areas.

The TIGER grants are an excellent opportunity for the department to assist states 
and metropolitan areas in one of their hardest tasks: transcending the stovepiping 
of disparate transportation, housing, energy, and environmental programs that 
remains a serious cause of undesirable transportation-related outcomes. The 
integrated and interdependent nature of the new challenges and issues contrast 
sharply with the nature of the institutions that exist today. These institutions tend 
to be independent, fragmented, and working to relatively narrow mandates with 
closed decision processes.

While the interim notice does recognize the connection between transportation 
and greenhouse gas emissions the integration goals should be more cross-
cutting. In this regard, the ""Disciplinary Integration"" subheading under the 
Partnership criteria should include policy areas such as housing (beyond public 
housing) energy independence, labor markets, competition, and land use, for 
example. The U.S. DOT should be open to microeconomic drivers that are more 
qualitative than quantitative. The brief mention of the effects of transportation on 
household spending in the Long Term Outcomes section should also be reinforced 
here.

4.  Require partnerships that cross jurisdictional borders.

Surface transportation is so evidently and inherently metropolitan that it is a 
natural start for cross-border collaboration. Simply put, truly achieving projects of 
national/metro/regional significance is impossible without demonstrated 
collaboration both vertically among governmental levels (e.g., state, metro, local) 
and horizontally among neighboring jurisdictions. Therefore, the partnerships 
section should require applicants to engage in partnerships that cross 
jurisdictional borders.

There is also considerable interest in private sector companies and investors to 
engage in partnerships with the public sector to deliver transportation projects. 
Such partnerships should be recognized and encouraged.

5. Outline a process for program evaluation.

The U.S. DOT is taking a bold and important step with the TIGER grants. In 
addition to tracking the success of the TIGER projects, the program itself should 
be evaluated. The program should outline how U.S. DOT will establish its own 
performance measures for program evaluation. Applicants should consider what 
steps they will take including the collection of baseline and post-implementation 
data. A national evaluation team is needed to be responsible for the evaluation 
design and analysis and reporting of findings.  They should work closely with each 
applicant in the collection of the evaluation data.

The project, involving three counties in northeastern South Carolina, will provide for 
the first time, an interstate system directly servicing one of the most popular 
tourist destinations in the country.  More importantly, it will provide a critical 
evacuation need.  If a major hurricane was to hit Myrtle Beach, SC, the amount of 
time needed to evacuate the area because of the lack of an interstate artery to 
move people out could potentially put in danger a signficant numbers of lives.  

The State of South Carolina has tried to proactively address the need for an 
interstate leg in this area for the past five years.  Local tax collections have been 
used to build a portion already.  A TIGER grant will progress the project and the 
timing couldn't be better in that our area has an unemployment average that far 
exceeds the national average.

On behalf of The North Eastern Strategic Alliance (NESA), a nine county regional 
economic development organization based in Florence, South Carolina, I would 
like to express my support for the construction of the I-73 Interchange of Hope 
using funds from the TIGER Discretionary Grants program.  From past economic 
impact studies and other research, we are confident that this project will make a 
tremendous economic impact on the region that we represent.  We believe that 
this project fully meets all four of the key objectives stated in the overall plan for 
national economic recovery.

1.	Long Term Outcomes – I-73 will provide a new thoroughfare from Myrtle 
Beach, South Carolina to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, connecting six states with 
more than 900 miles of roadway.  I-73 is currently designated as Congressional 
High Priority #5 and is the top priority for the South Carolina Department of 
Transportation.  I-73 will serve not only as a new corridor for increased passenger 
and freight commerce between Myrtle Beach and all of the states involved but also 
as a hurricane evacuation route. I-73 will intersect with I-95 and connect several 
metro areas.   
2.	Job Creation and Economic Stimulus – A Coastal Carolina University 
economic impact study shows that the construction of I-73 will create nearly 
5,000 construction jobs and $170.8 million in new household income annually 
during the construction period.  The annual construction impact on the regional 
economy is estimated at $818.9 million and an impact of $277.8 million on 
household income.  3,040 additional jobs will be created as a “ripple effect” and 
will boost employment, lower unemployment, reduce the strain on the state’s 
unemployment insurance fund, and generate additional tax revenue for state and 
local governments.  
3.	Innovation – 74% of the 14 million visitors to the Myrtle Beach area 
travel there via I-95 but there is no direct connection between I-95 and the coast of 
South Carolina (roughly 75 miles). The southernmost section of I-73 is partially 
completed and will connect I-95 to the coast.  During peak tourist season, I-73 will 
alleviate strain on local roads, increase the ease of travel to the coast, and 
significantly reduce travel time.  By reducing travel time to the coast, I-73 could 
increase visitation by 575,000 visitors annually, creating an annual economic 
impact of $1.15 billion. 
4.	Partnership – The I-73 project represents a multi-state partnership via 
the I-73 Association.  For more information on the I-73 Association, please visit 
http://www.i73.com/default.html.
Given the broad positive ramifications of this project, I sincerely believe that this 
project is conducive to the overall purpose of the recovery act.  I appreciate your 
consideration of this project.

RE: 	Comments of the Yurok Tribe on the interim notice of funding 
availability for supplemental discretionary grants for capital investments in surface 
transportation infrastructure under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
and Request for comments on grant criteria – Docket No. OST-2009-0115


	The Yurok Tribe (Tribe) is pleased to offer these comments in response 
to the Department of Transportation’s (Department) Interim Notice of Funding 
Availability for Supplemental Discretionary Grants for Capital Investments in 
Surface Transportation Infrastructure Under the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act and Request for Comments on Grant Criteria, published in the 
Federal Register on May 18, 2009.   The discretionary grant program, referred to 
as “Grants for Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery” 
or “TIGER Grants,” represents a unique opportunity to address the critical 
economic development and transportation needs of tribal applicants.  

	With a tribal population on and off the Reservation of 5,500, the Yurok 
Tribe is the largest tribe in California, and resides primarily on a reservation 
spanning over 64,000 acres along a 35-mile reach of the Klamath River.  Much of 
our transportation infrastructure is either incomplete or in dire need of repairs as a 
result of the extreme isolated geographic region of our ancestral territory.  The 
absence of safe and direct transportation routes between reservation communities 
and to nearby employment centers has hampered the economic development 
necessary to lift the Tribe out if its nearly 80 percent unemployment rate.  In order 
to help the Department meet the statutory objective of promoting long-term 
economic growth under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), 
the Yurok Tribe submits the following comments and recommendations to ensure 
that tribal governments are able to benefit from this important program.

	The Tribe strongly supports the explicit inclusion of “tribal governments” 
within the TIGER’s class of Eligible Applicants.    The program’s complementary 
purposes to facilitate long- and short-term economic growth through infrastructure 
development are well matched to the general needs of Indian Country and the 
Yurok Reservation in particular.  By including Tribes within the definition of Eligible 
Applicants, the Department meets its statutory obligations and provides tribal 
governments the chance to address severe transportation and economic 
development needs that are otherwise likely to go unmet.   

	In addition to treatment as Eligible Applicants, the guidance for TIGER 
grants should be adjusted to clarify a number of other points.  First, the guidance 
should make clear that, in appropriate circumstances, grants can be awarded 
directly to tribal applicants – not passed through state agencies for distribution to 
tribal applicants.  Second, the guidance should establish that funds awarded to 
Tribes will not be counted towards ARRA’s 20 percent limit on the total funds 
awarded to projects in a single State.  The rationale for each of these requests 
appears below.  

	First, while the Yurok Tribe is independently eligible for many 
Department programs, we do not generally receive federal transportation dollars 
until they pass through the California Department of Transportation’s funding 
allocation formula.  The Department’s treatment of Tribes as Eligible Applicants, 
as proposed above, would strongly suggest that TIGER Grants will be awarded 
directly to successful tribal applicants.  Because this approach deviates from the 
Department’s standard practice, however, we feel that additional clarification 
regarding the direct distribution is merited.  Much of TIGER’s potential arises from 
its discretionary nature and ready availability to applicants.  The Yurok 
Reservation’s need for transportation infrastructure has been underserved because 
the bulk of federal roads funding is both non-discretionary and must compete with 
other priorities for funding by a state agency.  This approach makes the Yurok and 
other similarly situated Tribes subject to rigid formulaic factors which often fail to 
capture the severity of tribal needs.  Because the TIGER Grant program is not 
linked to a formula and the Secretary may make awards directly to project 
applicants, the program presents a significant opportunity to assist traditionally 
underserved communities and to provide exactly the kind of long-term economic 
recovery ARRA is designed to engender.  

	Second, we respectfully submit that any grant to a tribal government 
within a particular state should not be counted against the 20 percent cap on total 
TIGER funds available to recipients within that State.  Under TIGER’s total $1.5 
billion allocation, the 20 percent cap implies a maximum State allocation of $300 
million.  Placing State and tribal applications within the same narrowed funding 
pool will make it more difficult for the Secretary to pursue ARRA’s directives and 
to fund all projects that best meet the proposed grant criteria.  If grants to tribal 
governments are counted within the State cap, the viability of any tribal application 
will be closely tied to its ability to convince the surrounding State to reduce its 
other TIGER requests.  In addition, the unique sovereign status of tribes, who are 
responsible for countless miles of road across the nation and some of whose 
reservations encompass areas larger than some states, suggest the need of tribal 
eligibility as separate from or parallel to States.  

	Finally, and as a supplement to the more general comments above, we 
submit the following specific recommendations to ensure that the final grant 
criteria fully reflect the status of tribal governments as Eligible Applicants.  

	Both primary selection criteria, Long-Term Outcomes and Jobs 
Creation and Economic Stimulus, include a number of sub-criteria that generally 
reward projects that can demonstrate advanced planning and have already 
received or show a high probability of receiving approvals required in addition to the 
TIGER discretionary grant application.  However, none of these sub-criteria 
explicitly acknowledge the active and important role that tribal governments can 
play in the project planning and approval process.  The criteria therefore should 
include the following amendments:

	The Long-Term Outcomes sub-criterion of “State of Good Repair” 
should be amended to include tribal efforts. As proposed, the criterion only reward 
projects that are “part of, or consistent with, relevant state, local or regional efforts 
to maintain transportation facilities or systems in a state of good repair.”   We 
recommend that the above enumeration of planning entities should be expanded 
to include tribal governments.  

	The Job Creation & Economic Stimulus sub-criteria favoring projects 
ready to start quickly require a number of amendments to properly reward projects 
supported by advance tribal planning procedures.  Section II(B)(1)(b)(i)-(iv), 
pursuant to ARRA’s statutory preference for quick-start projects, lists a number of 
sub-criteria within the Jobs Creation criteria designed to help the Department 
assess how quickly a TIGER Grant recipient can proceed with the project 
proposal.  We submit the following changes for your review:

1.	Sub-criterion (ii), Environmental Approvals, militates in favor of projects 
that can demonstrate “[r]eceipt (or reasonably anticipated receipt) of all 
environmental approvals necessary for the project to proceed…including 
satisfaction of all Federal, State, and local requirements.” 74 Fed. Reg. 23231 (II
(B)(1)(b)(ii)).  The list of Federal, State, and local entities should be expanded to 
include Tribes to account for the responsibilities many tribal governments have 
undertaken to manage their environmental resources.
2.	Sub-criterion (iii), Legislative Approvals, favors projects that can 
demonstrate “evidence of support from State and local officials, including relevant 
governor(s) and/or mayors.”  Id (II(B)(1)(b)(iii)).  Projects submitted for approval by 
tribal governments are typically subjected to a tribal approval process. Expanding 
this sub-criterion to be more Tribe inclusive would better ensure that project 
proposals enjoy tribal support and reward tribal applicants who participate in more 
detailed planning and approval process.
3.	Sub-criterion (iv), State and Local Planning, rewards projects that are 
included “in the relevant State, metropolitan, and local planning documents.”  Id (II
(B)(1)(b)(iv)).  The sub-criteria should be expanded to include Tribal planning 
documents.

	We believe the TIGER discretionary grant program provides a unique 
and important opportunity to stimulate long-term economic development in tribal 
areas long underserved by the conventional formulaic approach.  The Yurok tribe 
has been struggling for many years to undertake a substantial and absolutely 
necessary roads repair projects.  Without supplemental funds to do so, our 
access to employment opportunities on and off the reservation will continue to be 
highly constrained.  TIGER, if administered in a way that preserves the program’s 
discretionary nature and consistently recognizes the unique challenges and 
characteristics of tribes, could bring enormous benefit to the Yurok and throughout 
Indian Country.  

Respectfully,

The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority would like to comment on Docket 
No. OST-2009-0115, TIGER Discretionary Grants.

1.  Section III.B describes the conditions under which a component of a project 
could be considered.   The Airports Authority recommends tht an engineering and 
design project be an eligible component of a project if it can be demonstrated that 
advancing the engineering and design would create positive economic impacts 
and jobs by advancing the project’s construction. 

2.  The Airports Authority also recommends that the Department consider the 
benefits of the advanced construction of the full project, not just the engineering 
and design phase.

3.  The Airports Authority recommends that transit projects being developed 
without the use of Section 5309 funds (New Starts and Small Starts), still be 
considered an eligible transit project.  

4.  The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority is a public body created by an 
interstate compact between the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of 
Virginia.  It wishes to apply for funds even though its project is not in the approved 
State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) and is not being funded with 
state funds.  Note that the Airports Authority’s Chief Executive Officer, rather than 
the Governor of Virginia, signed the Airports Authority’s Section 1511 certification 
for an application for funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 
2009 Public Transportation Capital Investment Grants Program Appropriation and 
Allocations. 

5.  The Airports Authority concurs in the comments of Jennifer Strehler of Avon, 
Colorado, and Sherry Bohnert Earley of Hampton Roads, Virginia, with regard to 
the requirement that the project be in the State Transportation Improvement Plan.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment and for your consideration.

Sincerely yours,
Philip G. Sunderland
General Counsel

[Docket No. OST-2009-0115]

Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER)

On March 05, 2009, the City of San Antonio’s City Council adopted the Funding 
Strategy Plan for economic stimulus projects.  The Funding Strategy Plan serves 
as a guide for stimulus funding grant submissions. The City’s goal is to move 
forward with due diligence in and effective and efficient manner in the 
implementation of stimulus funding projects.  The City respectfully offers the 
following comments:


1.	The Notice of Funding Availability (NoFA) states that priority will be 
given to projects that are completed on or before February 17, 2012.  In addition, 
the NoFA states that the Department of Transportation may announce selected 
projects to receive grant funds no later than February 17, 2010.  A two year 
completion timeline for large projects requiring approximately (12-18) months of 
project design plus (18-24) months to receive environmental clearances will 
present completion challenges, such as accelerated construction schedules.  We 
recommend this requirement be reconsidered and that project timelines be 
evaluated on an individual basis to meet the completion needs of larger 
construction projects

2.	The City supports the secondary selection criteria of “partnerships.”  
The City plans to explore and incorporate collaborative partnerships with relevant 
regional entities such as VIA Metropolitan Transit.


Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

significant economic benefits to projects of national and regional significance.   
Interstate 73, established as High Priority Corridor #5 in ISTEA, remains an 
uncompleted national priority.  The South Carolina portion of this corridor was 
named a project of national and regional significance in SAFETEA-LU for good 
reason:  the project will reside in 3 counties in northeastern South Carolina where 
average unemployment is more than twice the national average.  This interstate 
will also extend the national interstate system to Myrtle Beach, SC, the nation’s 
busiest vacation destination without interstate access.  

A significant portion of this road has already been built using local tax collections.  
The State of South Carolina has made a recurring investment to I-73 every year for 
the past five years.  The South Carolina General Assembly has also approved 
legislation authorizing tolls to be collected upon its portion of I-73.  A TIGER grant 
will allow the project to make considerable progress on the ground, creating jobs 
that are badly needed.  Key benefits of I-73 include:
 

Job creation, both from construction of the road and surrounding economic 
development, in nearby areas that are economically distressed; 
Improved safety, especially for hurricane evacuations from the South Carolina 
coast; 
Economic growth of the nation’s busiest vacation destination without interstate 
access.  

With so much state and local funding already invested in this project, the USDOT 
should give serious consideration to funding Interstate 73 in South Carolina 
through a TIGER grant.

solution during our economic problems. Unfortunately, I do not believe that the 
proposed process and regulations proposed by the Department of Transportation 
reflect the best short-term interests of the public, nor do they convey the intentions 
of the Congress. A simple reading of the Recovery Act and the proposed rules DO 
NOT match! Moreover, DOT has tried to inject some of its old and, unfortunately, 
ineffective ideas into a new program designed by the Congress. DOT, it seems, is 
working for some other government or entity, but completely for the US Congress!

There are a few things that DOT should do to fix this problem. First, do not try to 
inject its old long term objectives into a short-term program. By the time any of 
these funds are committed, the economy will well on its way to recovery on the 
bodies of those who have already sacrificed enough! These funds need to be 
available immediately. This is the new standard that the Congress has set in the 
context of the Recovery Act. Indeed, this specific program is discretionary. Thus, it 
does not need the enormity of the DOT juggernaut to get the ball rolling. To much 
has been injected in a very simple concept. Indeed, it looks as though DOT has 
intentionally subverted the will of the Congress. Do we still have a constitution or 
what?

As an Asian American, I am concerned about how minorities and minority 
business will benefit. The vague outline of DOT's already bankrupt DBE program is 
simply embarrassing! The program does not work; and, DOT should improve these 
sections so that minority business will benefit. It is really not a matter for 
discussion. These ineffective provisions will permit big contractors to ""eat"" minority, 
small, veteran-owned, and women owned businesses as they have in the past 
under the watchful eye of DOT and State governments. It is, after all, small 
business that is the major employer in the USA.

One interesting proposal from another commentator is the idea of partnership. 
Private sector partnerships should be strongly encouraged. This is a way to build in 
sustained jobs using these short-term jobs. After a utility or infrastructure element 
is complete, the jobs go away or are radically reduced! Partnerships can extend 
this employment opportunity and the effectiveness of the government's contribution. 
It is an important new proposal that should be actively explored and expanded.

In general, this proposal is in no one's best interest. The rules should be withdrawn 
and revised -- as Congress and the President expected.",,,,,,,

when I visited) I can't remember a time that we have not been working to get a 
main Interstate completed into the beach. After the first Hurricane I encountered 
here, and trying to get out of the beach,  I realized how important an interstate 
was to our area for not only the locals safety but all those tourists that visit us to 
be able to exit the beach safely and in a timely manner.    It is also next to 
impossible for growth to this busy vacation destination without interstate access.   
I feel that jobs will be created both from the construction of the road and the 
surrounding economic development in areas around us that are economically 
distressed. The other point that I want to stress is that Myrtle Beach relies soley 
on Tourism and we cannot attract any manufacturing or other types of industry as 
we are very hard to reach without an interstate.

Interstate 73, established as High Priority Corridor #5 in ISTEA, is I believe a 
national priority.  With so much time, effort and money already invested and  so 
much of this road already having been built using local tax collections, and the 
states recurring investment to 1-73 for the past five years the TIGER grant 
program will fund important infrastructure projects that deliver significant economic 
benefits to projects of national and regional significance and will allow the project 
to make considerable progress on the ground.   

The South Carolina General Assembly has also approved legislation authorizing 
tolls to be collected upon its portion of I-73.  

Its my personal opinion that the USDOT should give serious consideration to 
funding this project in South Carolina through a TIGER Grant.

Allegiant's imposing an additional fee for online booking is an obvious attempt at an end run on DOT policy. For an airline, online booking through the airline's own website is recognized as the lowest-cost transaction. Requiring travelers to visit an airport ticket counter -- that might be open and busy only a few hours a week -- as the only way to avoid a hefty ""convenience"" fee is clearly a de-facto fare increase and a blatant flouting of DOT's principles for honest pricing. In fairness to Allegiant customers, DOT should take immediate and strong enforcement action to require honest fare presentation.

Petitioner Pevsner contends that most consumers are, in fact, unable to avoid Allegiant's poorly-disclosed ""convenience fee,"" which amount Allegiant should therefore be irequired to nduce in its featured base prices. Rather than rebut petitioner's claim, Allegiant's response actually substantiates it. In its earlier filing (DOT-OST-2008-0031), Allegiant alleged that the fee should not be considered mandatory because 1500 people per week avoided it. What Allegiant failed to mention is that those 1500 people represent about 2% of Allegiant's total traffic -- a fighre that, in fact, substantiates petitioner's allegation that the fee is unavoidable to the great bulk of Allegiant's passengers.

To avoid the $16 fee, passengers must drive to the nearest airport (which could be many miles away), park (probably in a high-charge short-term lot), and stand in line with with boarding passengers for a considerable time to buy a ticket. 
In effect, Allegiant has deliberately created a financial and time barrier to avoidance of the fee that only a very small number of passengers would be willing or able to overcome. Allegiant's policy is an obvious ploy to charge almost all of its travelers $16 more (each way) than the base fare, as presented. This is a clear violation of DOT policy on airfare displays and shold be prohibited immediately.",,,,,,,

As to my knowledge after reading the proposal, there are only added benefits for the public as well as the industry.

Intrepid Int'l Airlines Prospectus FAILED the EAS statutory guarantee of 2 round trips per day; and FAILED the EAS statutory guarantee of limit of 1 interim stop.

An appropriate course of action would be USDOT's rejection of Intrepid's clearly deficient submission as ""non responsive"" immediately upon receipt and initial review.

Instead, as a consequence of USDOT's treatment of the Intrepid International Airlines Prospectus as a valid RFP response - our community, its various Boards and Agencies, as well as USDOT itself, have wasted precious time and money in this matter.",,,,,,,

I travel by air around eight times per year.  As you know, living in an isolated rural area makes travel scheduling a little more complicated.  Two flights in and out of the CIU ariport a day are barely enough to adequately allow for weather delays which are very common during our long winter months. It is essential to have a minimum of two flights.  Please do not consider any bids that only have one flight per day.  I am also concerned about losing code share, ticket, baggage, and mileage agreements with major carriers. I hope you will consider the needs of you frequent flyers and your less frequent ones.",,,,,,,

In the past 5 years I have flown a minimum of 50,000 miles each year and in 2009 I flew 125,000 miles.  The vast majority of these domestic and international flights began and ended at CIU.  The convenience of flying from CIU directly to Detroit Metro (DTW) is beyond description.  If Mesaba is not award this contract, I will forced to make a flight to Midway via APN and LAN, with no code-share, no baggage agreement, and no international access.  This would be an incredible hardship.  By keeping Mesaba (Delta) in our home airport (CIU) you would be allowing a large amount of people to have access to the world via DTW.  I can't image using CIU if I have to fly to Midway with absolutely no benefits.  I will certainly use PLN. Please keep Delta and their partner Mesaba at CIU.",,,,,,,
