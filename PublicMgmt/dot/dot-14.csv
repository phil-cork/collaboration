For example, is there a priority determined as to projects? What about the deteriorating conditions and/or life spans of projects, are these considered? I would also want to ensure money is distributed equally between states to ensure that the entire amount isn’t allocated to projects in only one or two states? Ultimately, I believe that having such criteria for the allocation process is extremely important as it will allow you to give an explanation of why you have denied/approved someone for funds and will cut down on the appearance of bias. 

Likewise, is there an appeal process for the individuals denied qualified highway or surface freight transfer facility funds? Simply saying you’re denied when there is no set criteria and at the pure discretion of one person doesn’t usually sit well and or seem right without some sort of appeal process in place. 

It also seems troubling that the Department states, “The Department is not specifying any form for an application.” I do believe that uniformity in the application process would not only be easier for the applicant, but also be more cost efficient for the individuals on the other end who are processing such. 

Thank you for you time and consideration.

     I am writing to comment on the application process and the exercise of allocation authority concerning Docket No. OST-2005-23418, Applications for Authority for Tax-Exempt Financing of Highway Projects and Rail-Truck Transfer Facilities. 

     I am dismayed to learn that DOT does not have a standard process in place for the application process. It would seem a logical step to create a uniform application form that requests all of the information that would be necessary to evaluate the applicant's project. Not requiring any form for applications and not requiring the initial application to include all of the pertinent information is a gross mismanagement of the process. The process would be streamlined by requiring all of the information up front instead of burdening DOT employees with chasing down the information in order to provide a thorough evaluation of the applicant's project. This amounts to a waste of tax-payer money and employees time that could be better spent in other areas.

     I would also like to comment on how the exercise of allocation authority occurs. There is very little information concerning how projects are evaluated and chosen. I think this stems from the lack of a coherent national transportation plan, especially concerning the movement of freight. This money should be funding projects that relieve bottlenecks and encourage the efficient flow of freight through the country and at our nation's ports as well as funding improvements to our nations most heavily used roads. It appears from the limited information provided that projects are simply approved if they meet the applicable statutory requirements and tax-exempt authority is available for the type and location of the project. Saying that allocations are occurring in a fair and reasonable manner is very abstract. Who is determining what is fair and reasonable? What are the criteria for fair and reasonable? 

     I do believe that this allocation of funds is badly needed to fund infrastructure improvements however, I am concerned that the implementation is lacking in certain areas. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to comment.

These bonds are supported by US Congress and encourage private investment in projects that may not receive conventional financing.  Most highway and freight transfer facility projects are funded by multiple entities, some private and some public. It’s useful to have the additional lending options PABs provide to access capital for projects. 

The state and local governments should continue to carefully review projects that are issued PABs to ensure the projects are qualified and contribute to economic development. This will help maintain the integrity of the program to improve the American economy and deter opponents.  

Part B of Section 11143 of SAFETEA-LU lists the process of applying to the Department of Transportation DOT for allocation of PAB’s.  Number 7 on that list requests that the applicant provide a project description. I would suggest adding to the requirements by asking the applicant to provide the perceived economic impact of the project that is requesting the PAB allocation. This would require the applicant to do some research for the purpose of maximizing the positive community impacts of the project.  This should be one of the main determining factors to receive an award.

Thank you,

The document, with reference identifier OST-2005-23418, prompted me to make a suggestion on the application process for PABs. Currently, there is no standard application. The document states some suggested information for the applicant to submit, but then explains that all of the information suggested is not required. I am confident that a standard, comprehensive application can create uniformity amongst applicants. This will require the applicants to be sincere and prepared before applying, as well as enable the DOT to efficiently review all of the applications on an informed basis. 

Additionally, an online portal for applicants could be created. There, the applicant could retrieve, revise and submit their application electronically. Furthermore, the applicant could track the status of their application and receive any necessary communications from the DOT. This would have a positive environmental impact and enable applicants to more easily file and revise their application.

Thank you in advance for your time.

On May 15, 2002, Congress enacted the “Notification and Federal Employee Anti-discrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002,” Public Law 107-174, which is now known as the No FEAR Act. One purpose of the Act is to “require that Federal agencies be accountable for violations of anti-discrimination and whistle-blower protection laws.” In support of this purpose, Congress found that “agencies cannot be run effectively if those agencies practice or tolerate discrimination.” The Act also requires this agency to provide this notice to Federal employees, former Federal employees and applicants for Federal employment to inform you of the rights and protections available to you under Federal anti-discrimination, whistle-blower protection and retaliation laws.

I am for the No Fear Act 110%. No employee or person for that matter, should ever feel afraid due to discrimination. Unfortunately, it is a problem I have seen first hand. Even with the No Fear Act, I think there is still fear when it comes to discrimination. It is very beneficial to have a rule like this for the protection of all. ",,,,,,,

All airlines need to put their fees in plain site where potential customers can compare apples to apples. Hotels do it. Every time I book, I know what parking will be, what resort fees will be, what local taxes will be, etc., before I click ""reserve."" Same goes with rental cars. I know that if I book a car at Little Rock, the base may be $22 per day, but the taxes and other associated fees may be more than that per day. But it's all itemized and all in plain site. Don't let the airlines bamboozle you into letting them continue all of their add-ons behind the scenes. They claim that they would be the only part of the travel industry required to do so. I don't know if hotels and rental car agencies are required to do, but they all do in my experience. Just look at all of the profit the airlines have made from these add-on fees. That's what is keeping them flying, not the actual ticket. It's like Barbie. The Barbie doll is cheap. It's all of her clothes, accessories and automobiles that drive the cost up. Please hold tough and don't let the airlines have their ways. Having all of the fees in plain site will be good for consumers, especially those who are frequent fliers.",,,,,,,

3. E-cigs are used to vape marijuana, still Federally illegal. Let's keep it from planes.

Flying is miserable. Having people vaping will make it more so. Don't allow it.",,,,,,,

I am a former AA flight attendant who testified before Congress to get smoking banned on the airlines and then went on to work on smoking bans in my city and state. I recently sat next to a young woman who used an e-cig on an American Airlines flight. I told her I did not believe they were allowed and she used it anyway. Because I have chronic sinusitus and asthma and am very sensitive to the particulate matter given off by cigarettes and these e-cigs, I ended up getting sick shortly after the flight with a sinus infection, 2 rounds of antibiotics and steroids over the course of a month. I sent letter to the flight attendant union and the American Airlines CEO and heard nothing back. I also expressed my concern for safety as an e-cig was to blame for a fire in the baggage compartment on a JetBlue flight recently. E-cigs should be prohibited from being carried on or checked and certainly not used in an enclosed aluminum tube at 35.000 feet. Because the airlines won't listen to common sense we need federal regulations to protect the flying public. Some things never change, airline CEO's do not ""protect the public"", they only protect their bottom line.

This is a public health issue: Flight attendants and the public should not be expected to differentiate between a tobacco cigarette and an electronic smoking device, nor should they be exposed to any type of secondhand smoke or aerosol. 

E-cigarettes do not just emit harmless water vapor. In fact, water is not an ingredient in these products.

Secondhand e-cigarette aerosol contains nicotine, hazardous ultra fine particles, volatile organic compounds, and other chemicals, some of which are carcinogenic (e.g., formaldehyde, metals like cadmium, lead, & nickel, and nitrosamines).

At least 10 chemicals identified in e-cigarette aerosol are on Californias Proposition 65 list of carcinogens and reproductive toxins.

It is not fair to everyone on board the flight to have to breathe in someone else's fumes because they can't wait until the flight ends to vape. Plus, there are people like one of my family members who gets sick breathing the vapors in because it irritates the lining of his throat and lungs. To allow people to vape will affect his health. Until the long-term effects of vaping products are determined, airlines should not put people at risk for developing health problems. In addition, if vaping is allowed now on aircrafts but later not allowed, the residue from the vaping will still be present in the aircraft in the same way that secondhand smoke is. 

I understand to an extent the reason that everyone is interested in the public opinion on this topic before making a decision, but the answer is simple to me: we should not ever allow something that we aren't sure the health consequences of to affect someone else's health especially when that person doesn't have the choice on whether or not to be affected like on a plane.

While this behavior did not affect other passengers, it highlights one of the characteristics of electronic cigarette use that I believe to be underestimated.

E-cigarette users can basically choose 3 types of systems:  a disposable, non-refillable e-cigarette; an e-cigarette where the user can change the nicotine cartridge and a ""tank"" system, that the user fills with their own ""e-juice"".  Basically, the second and third options can be filled with ANYTHING - e-juice bought at a vape store, or on-line, or made at home on your kitchen stovetop.  The second option can be refilled using a syringe or a toothpick (see youtube for refilling demonstrations).

Allowing e-cigarette use on planes means that you have no idea what is being vaped in a very small space.  It could be flavor and nicotine or be THC or something else that is either illegal and/or causes a ""high"".  This is the problem with allowing e-cigarette use in workplaces but clearly becomes more serious in the relatively small space of an aircraft.",,,,,,,

Are you kidding me, OK here this is easy ask any Fireman you know and ask him how safe is it to breathe gases/smoke etc.. Easier still ask any Kindergartener what hey learned about fire safety and ask them what the most important thing do during a fire. 

Guess what on a plane you cant crawl around on the floor to get away from that guys stinking vaporized nicotine gases.

One more thing do you know any farmers OK just ask them what is the most effective way to control insects?? (hint) 

Nicotine mist ummmm you mean Vaporized Nicotine???

Guess what is coming out of those little E-Cig thingy's 

Nicotine is not the only thing that be vaporized in those gadgets.

Know any spies i mean real CIA/Homeland Security spies/ Covert Op/Black water types yes they exist just ask them what they can do with a gadget that can vaporize chemicals into a fine mist in a enclosed area. I cant bring shampoo on a plane but you want to let (Many) someones  bring on a plane (MANY) electronic device(s) that burns (MANY) different unknown chemicals. These tiny little vials of undetermined chemicals that can be converted into a fine vapor mist. 

Are you going to check every single one of these little vials of unknown chemicals before they get on the plane,have you been to one of these places and seen how many different vaporizing chemicals they can use in those gizmos. 

And you were afraid someone might have a peanut reaction from a little bag of peanuts. Wait till about a say just 5 E-CIG patrons fires up five of these gizmos fueled with say a peanut flavored juice. 

ARE YOU KIDDING ME THAT I HAVE TO EVEN  SAY ALL THIS

Drug free is a choice I have made for myself.

Its never ok to put drugs into someone else's body against their will. Please pass the Proposed Rule that will allow me to stay drug free when I use public transportation like aircraft. Smoking is smoking whether the tobacco is in solid form like pipes, cigars and cigarettes or liquid form like in Electronic Cigarettes and Vape devices. They still contain dangerous drugs and release the drugs into the air bystanders are forced to breathe.
To date there are no studies that show that it is safe for someone to inhale a vapor or mist where it is exposed to their blood and then release the mist or droplets into the air for others to breathe. Studies have shown that dangerous viruses like Ebola can be transmitted by ""vapor"" or ""droplets"" exhaled by a infected person.

I want to expressing my support for prohibiting the use of ""E-cigarettes"" or other Nicotine delivery systems on all aircraft. These aerosols contain many hazardous chemicals, several of which are known carcinogens. Also, those of us who do not wish to breathe nicotine into our lungs should not be forced to do so via secondhand vapor from these devices against our will. This is a simple matter of individuals having the right to breathe air free of addictive and dangerous chemicals. Several chemicals in these ""E-cigarette"" devices have been identified and classified as known carcinogens and reproductive toxins. This is an issue of public health and the right of the majority to breathe clean air, just as it has been in regards to traditional tobacco cigarettes. Again, I support and encourage prohibiting the use of  E-cigarettes on all aircraft. Thank you.",,,,,,,

That should be reason enough, by itself, to issue a strong rule prohibiting any e-cigarette use on any  flights.

Allowing e-cigarette use in airplanes would also be a giant step backward in the denormalization of smoking/nicotine use that would model not just e-cigarette use but also smoking-like behavior to all the youth, and others, on the plane.

Also, prohibiting any e-cigarette use on airplanes would also help to discourage smoking, because smokers would not be able simply to switch to similar e-cigarette use while on flights, with no interruption of their lung-based nicotine consumption and no withdrawal symptoms to remind them of their addiction (or to prompt them to try to quit).

Looking at it from the other side, those smokers who are so addicted that going without smoking during a flight is painful can still use nicotine replacement therapies (e.g., nicotine gum or patches) to reduce their symptoms and get through the flights.  But having to use NRTs to do that (instead of a recreational e-cigarette) will remind them of their medically undesirable addiction  and the need to quit.

But the bottom line is that flights should not accommodate unhealthy behaviors by a small minority that expose innocent bystanders, possibly including small children or even babies, to physical irritation and significant health harms.

So stop the delay and issue the rule.",,,,,,,

It is known that e-cigarettes contain nicotine and carcinogens.  It is concerning that e-cigarette companies can ""mix"" their own e-liquid.  Who knows what is being emitted from the e-cigarettes when it is not regulated by the FDA?

Please prohibit all forms and types of e-cigarettes on airlines just as all other tobacco products have been prohibited.  Please protect the public and flight attendants from the hazards of all tobacco products including e-cigarettes.

E-cigarettes do not just emit harmless water vapor. In fact, water is not an ingredient in these products. 
Secondhand e-cigarette aerosol contains nicotine, hazardous ultra fine particles, volatile organic compounds, and other chemicals, some of which are carcinogenic (e.g., formaldehyde, metals like cadmium, lead, & nickel, and nitrosamines). At least 10 chemicals identified in e-cigarette aerosol are on Californias Proposition 65 list of carcinogens and reproductive toxins. In reality, in the current unregulated environment surrounding e-cigarettes, there are no product standards and no control over the emissions from these devices.  Their use should be prohibited in any indoor space, and certainly not in one like the cabin of an airplane that involuntary exposes workers and the public to such emissions.

ANSR urges the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to adopt rules that prohibit the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) on all airlines and in all transportation terminals without exceptions.    

A review of published data, titled, ""Electronic cigarettes:  Human health effects,"" written by Dr. Priscilla Callahan-Lyon, Office of Science, Center for Tobacco Products, Food and Drug Administration, lists 48 references in regard to research on how e-cigarettes affect users and those nearby.  The review informs the public, ""Nicotine is readily absorbed through the airway, skin, mucous membranes and gastrointestinal tract.  Acute exposure to inhaled nicotine may cause dizziness, nausea, or vomiting.""

ANSR is receiving complaints that confirm that non-smokers who suffer from respiratory and cardiovascular impairments are reacting to exposure to e-cigarette vapor.  Immediate reactions include wheezing, difficulty breathing, oxygen deprivation and reduced levels of consciousness.  Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.  See:  14 CFR Part 382, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel.  SUBPART C - REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING SERVICES Section 382.31 Refusal of transportation states,  (a)  ""Unless specifically permitted by a provision of this part, a carrier shall not refuse to provide transportation to a qualified individual with a disability on the basis of his or her disability.""  

On October 24, 2013, CBS 5 - KPHO news reported ""faulty e-cigarette likely to blame for fire that injured Vietnam Vet.""  The first fire scorched the carpet.  The second fire ""gutted the bedroom of their Sunnyslope area home.""  The home owner ""blames his wife's overheated ""Smokin'T e-cigarettes chargers for starting the fires.""  ""They just exploded.""  he said.  

The use of e-cigarettes threatens the health and safety of all passengers and all airline employees.  Infants, young children, the elderly and disabled passengers are especially vulnerable to exposure to e-cigarette vapor (ECV).  The risk of fire must be eliminated. 

The Department of Transportation must support the action taken voluntarily by the airlines by taking action to prohibit the use of e-cigarettes on all air carriers and in all airport facilities without exception and without delay.

It is indeed possible that e-cigarettes present a real danger on flights; however, your department offers no scientific proof of this conclusion and seems to be creating arbitrary regulation.   

Traditional cigarettes were banned on commercial airlines because they were PROVEN to create a fire hazard and excess second-hand smoke for other passengers. However, until it is PROVEN that e-cigarettes can cause a similar danger as traditional cigarettes, I am not convinced that banning them outright will do anything except create needless regulation. 

If your only justification for banning e-cigarettes is that they may make passengers feel uncomfortable, then why stop with just these devices? Why not ban passengers from eating garlic on the plane? Certainly these garlic-consuming passengers' neighbors will feel uncomfortable sitting next someone with smelly breath. Or, why not ban passengers who might snore from falling asleep during the flight? Others around them will definitely get a better night's sleep if not inconvenienced by the snores of that passenger.  Or, most importantly, why not ban airlines from installing the tiny, economy-sized seats in their planes? Most passengers over the age of seven feel uncomfortable squeezing into such a cramped space. The list for all potential flight nuisances is lengthy, but it would be absurd to ban most of these.  I cannot distinguish how e-cigarettes are any different than these other annoyances unless provided some concrete evidence to support such a conclusion.  

To ban a product just because it is a nuisance for other passengers would bring about a slippery slope. Unless the department can offer some real correlative evidence that e-cigarettes have a direct harm for airline passengers, I am not convinced that this regulation will do anything but restrict individual passengers' liberty to enjoy non-smoke cigarettes on their flight.

There is evidence that nitrosamines, a group of carcinogens found specifically in tobacco, are carried over into the e-cigarette fluid from the nicotine extraction process.10 There is also evidence that the glycol carriers can by oxidized by the heating elements used in e-cigarettes to vaporize the liquids, creating aldehydes such as formaldehyde. Consumers should be warned that, while the health risks associated with the usage of e-cigarettes are less than those associated with tobacco smoking, there
remain substantial health risks associated with the use of e-cigarettes.""

When I am sitting in the airport waiting for my flight I can move away easily enough but when I am stuck on a plane with no empty seats that option simply would not exist.  Those 3 - 4 hours in the air are absolutely precious to me - I can get ready for whatever I am flying too, or frankly wind down on my way home so I am not worthless when I hit the front door.

I suppose if the DOT is inclined to pass this anyway then you should be required to give every traveler a pair of noise cancelling headphones.  However, since they run $300 a pair, and according to the NATCA there are between 25,000 and 30,000 traveler per day (just in the U.S. - can you imagine sitting on a 12 hour international flight with the person beside you gabbing the whole way?!?!?!) that would run about $7.5M a day.

As an airline customer, I feel that allowing the use of connection for the purposes of texting, e-mailing, web-surfing, and other non-voice activities can be imperative to customers.  Some people traveling need access to online systems for work or family obligations while traveling.  If these activites do not pose a safety risk with electronics and communications for the flight itself, I see no reason not to allow passengers the additional communication or entertainment during flights.

With regards to voice communication, whether via mobile phone or internet, I believe it should be banned for the comfort of the other passengers.  Having people around you holding voice conversations constantly can make a long flght down-right unbearable and is even rude to the other passengers.  That said, there may be others that would contend they should be allowed to use their phone for an emergency reason.  If you are traveling, then arrangements should already be made for an alternate emergency contact while you are on the plane.  Should a dire emergency arise on the flight, people may ignore the rule, but in mose cases I feel that banning voice activites is best for the flying public.

This would be an unfair, unavoidable, disruptive and dangerous intrusion that will have adverse affect on the passenger's flight comfort, health and post arrival safety.  Real and true in flight emergency calls can be done by airline personnel. 
 
In response to the numbered sections on this website:
1) To allow voice or computer generated voice communications would be unfair to all airline passengers as it would be disruptive to personal conversation, and reduce or in some situations totally preclude any manner of personal focus, concentration and work productivity.  It would also reduce the ability of passengers to rest or sleep on the plane for all flights, including but not limited to early morning and evening flights, and in so doing would present a danger to many persons, not the least of which is the international flyer and frequent business flyer, both of which I am one.  These individuals already live with a disrupted sleep pattern, like the majority of us, and the further intrusion into their rest by non-stop phone calls will surely result in further incidents of sleep deprived auto accidents and other serious incidents of injury at their ultimate destinations.
3) A passenger's exposure to any manner of voice communication, whether personal or electronically produced, and whether at the spoken/transmitting or receiving end, will have similar adverse effects.  All manner of mobile wireless voice communication should be prohibited in flight.
4) The only exception to a total ban on mobile voice communication on airlines I could see as reasonable would be allowances for single entry charter flights where all passengers were employees or members of an organization that was paying 100% of the flight cost of all passengers on the airline, with no payment by the passengers for their participation in the flight.  The rules would have to be tightly written to preclude carriers from finding loopholes that result in unaware passengers being exposed to undesired mobile device disruption.
6)  All voice/ sound communication receiving and/ or transmitting devices should be banned on airlines in flight except for emergency communications by flight crews and emergency personnel.
7)  Use of mobile phones and like communications until the aircraft door closes and once again after it opens works now because it enables passengers to communicate travel delays and arrange pickups and the like all at once and be done with it, without becoming overbearing to fellow passengers with prolonged communications. This is the limit of what should be allowed.
8) Crew members, air marshalls and the like should not be exempt from prohibitions on mobile device voice communications for other than emergency purposes.  Personal and business mobile device voice calls should not be allowed in flight by anyone.  If true emergency calls are required, they can be accommodated by crew members.
9) When on an aircraft, the person sitting next to you is not across the table from you, nor even at a comfortable sitting, let alone a comfortable working and listening distance.  They are not just ""in close quarters,"" they are literally in you personal space for the duration of the flight.  Psychological consultation and testing would be warranted as to the effects of intermittent and uncontrollable voices in a person's ear for which they have no control over duration or volume.  As referenced in comment one above, it is unfair, unhealthy and dangerous to introduce into an aircraft for sustained periods such a disruption to sleep, work productivity, and any means of focus and concentration.  As a business traveler I am especially concerned with the adverse effect on ability to be productive when working in flight, the discomfort of having the individual next to me talking in my ear where I hear both ends of an unwanted conversation spoken at abnormally loud volume, the unavoidable sound of unwanted voices all around me with no control (sounds like a psychological thriller if ever there was one) and the effect of traveling at odd hours, not just night, and then driving in a strange rental car in a strange city while overly tired because I was unable to sleep during my flight because of the sound of voices all around me.  It creates a dangerous situation on our highways that the USDOT should be well aware of.  As an individual who has experienced this, and who has been responsible for reviewing highway accident statistics associated with dozing while driving, this warrants a lot more analysis before any consideration of allowing mobile voice communications on flights.  I am staunchly opposed to the use of mobile voice communications devices on flights",,,,,,,

My background includes being a commercially rated pilot, frequent airline traveler, and smart phone user. The airline cabin environment is a complicated one, and is at times stressful. One of the problems in today's already stressful environment is that strangers, of different cultures and sometimes languages, are placed in extremely close proximity. Behaviors and activities that are appropriate for some may be considered inapropriate for others.Loud speaking and phone use are extremely intrusive and will only serve to raise the stress level further.

Last week, I had to summon the flight attendant to deal with a lady, seated behind me, who was talking on her cell phone, throughout the safety announcements and subsequent aircraft taxi. I can only imagine an emergency evacuation when people are trying to call network news and take videos instead of exiting the aircraft in an orderly fashion. In addition to the imposition on other travelers, I ultimately think we are dealing with a safety issue as well.

People speak louder on phones than they would to someone in person, reception will be dicey and cause connection issues, resulting in the oh-so-annoying ""can you hear me know"" phrase, and phones ringing will add noise (annoying tones, often) to an already noisy flight.  The seats on planes are restrictive enough without adding people's elbows at near face level to the mix or others desperately shuffling to get to their under-seat bags to find the ringing phone before they miss a call.  Lastly, planes already have multiple annoyances that are out of passenger's control (e.g. babies crying, restless animals, people listening to movies or music loud enough for the rows around them to hear, narrow seats and aisles where you are constantly squished, bumped into and uncomfortable, etc.) that adding phone conversations on top of it is preposterous when it can be prevented.

Here is why........

Yes - the FCC and DOT should definitely allow this technology....

TEXTING using cellphone technology through  picocells should certainly be allowed
100% full time.  Not an issue to other passengers.   This helps people inform loved ones about delays, ride pick-ups, travel status.  Airlines can always regulate when and of voice is available (early and late phases of flight perhaps).

My last flight had an alzheimer person in my seat
row.  Our flight got rerouted 100+ miles away due to fog.
This person could not even find her way to the rest room.
There was no way to inform her loved ones where she was
headed nor did she understand her predicament.

A cell call would have saved this poor lady a lot of stress
And her family a lot of concern.

No doubt there are a lot of patients like this,
Children traveling alone etc.

I have not heard about any international issues that have deployed this technology

Even on the longest flights, any emergencies can be addressed via the crew, and everything else can wait.  The maintenance of peace and security aboard airplanes trumps any minor convenience from being unable to use one's cell-phone for idle chatter, and with shrinking seats and personal space on most flights, being forced to listen to another passenger's business or personal concerns will acerbate the friction that already exists over limited elbow, ankle room and overhead bin space.  The growing inconveniences of routine air travel have frayed tempers enough.  If unnecessary telephone talk is added, there will be trouble.  Finally, if anyone thinks that compulsive cell-phone users will adopt a civil tone and limits their invasion of others' personal space, just listen to the loud and purposeless conversations that take place in the pre-boarding areas.  Those will be repeated on the planes in transit, ad nauseum.  In sum, opening air travel to cell-phone use is a TERRIBLE IDEA.   No no no, a thousand times no.",,,,,,,

Please don't lift the ban on voice calls.  Air travel is crazy enough and the only sanctuary sometimes is while actually flying through the air.  From the time you start your trip you are subject to crowds, repetitive robotic PA announcements in the airport, gate agent announcements, etc.  When you finally in the air and the flight crew announcements are done you can take a sigh of relief and sit back and enjoy a nap, a book, or music.  Most planes now have WiFi so business travelers can email and conduct business quietly via their laptop or tablet.  The last thing we need is some business guy conducting a conference call or a 15 year old teenager gabbing with their friends about Justin Beiber for the duration of a 2 hour flight.  Many people don't seem to understand that the phone amplifies their voice and carries it away to the caller at the other end.  They talk twice as loud to their phone as they would to someone sitting next right to them.  Many people become self absorbed in the phone call and unaware of their surroundings and the impact their actions are having on others around them.  

Please, allow data, silent texting, web browsing, etc.  But there is no room for voice calls on airplanes.  ",,,,,,,

The CAB precedent that smoking was NOT harmful to non-smokers on airlines and that it could still be prohibited on the grounds of it being injurious or harmful was a mistake and should not be used to justify a prohibition on cell phones.  Let the industry compete and experimentation determine what customers want.  This topic can be re-evaluated after several years of actual experience. 

While a passenger cannot remove himself from a seatmate making a call, the practice is not unfair, nor does it render air service inadequate. 

Addressing the specific questions:
1) No, it is not necessary to Is it necessary for the Department to propose a rule to deem passenger voice 
communications as an unfair practice, and ban voice communications on passengers’ 
mobile wireless devices on flights under any of the regulatory parts cited in the ANPRM.
2) As a traveler, I would rarely make a call from a flight, but may for a high priority business purpose or family emergency. The Department should refrain from issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking on this topic and 
instead allow the airlines to develop individual policies.
3) Provided it is technically safe, no voice communications should be banned, regardless of media type.
4) No ban should be put in place, however if one is, than charter flights, and especially single entity flights should be excepted, since the chartering entity should set it's own rules for such use, provided it is safe.
5) No comment
6) Text to speech SHOULD be excepted, especially as the user could use ear buds,or a headset. The primary ""noise"" to other passengers is from the passenger talking, as the other party is typically heard through a headset or ear buds.
11) Requiring use of some form of headset and not allowing speaker-phone use would cut down on the overall noise level. .

Please do NOT allow anyone to talk on their cell phone or whatever during a flight unless to call for 911. PLEASE!

Some people are so loud and rude and could be having an argument with someone and keep everyone who wants to read or sleep from doing so.

I cannot stand being on the DC Metro listening to the conversations and so I do NOT want to be an airplane for hours at at time in some cases.

I do understand that someone might want to clear up a misunderstanding or arrange for a babysitter but if you allow for email or text that should not be a problem. 

Please do NOT allow for any use of cell phones during a flight. Thank you for your time. Thanks.",,,,,,,

The rules as presently used should remain in full force and effect regarding the use of cell phones. I'll give you an antidote that occurred while I was getting a foot massage in Thailand last week. I was serenely resting in a lounge chair getting a foot massage, and as the chairs were close to each other, a foreign speaking dude sat next to me. He suddenly begins to have a cell phone conversation and is no more then 2 feet away from me (ear) while talking in a loud voice and completely unaware of annoying me or others in the vicinity, never mind that he was speaking in Russian or whatever language, and after giving him a severe dirty look that didn't even phase him, kept on talking!  I can only imagine this scenario taking place on an airplane with numerous people all talking at the same time in close proximity, and then  justifying their right to do so come hell or high water, and  listening to the inane conversations that take place.  We survived 20 years ago WITHOUT cell phones and we can certainly survive WITHOUT cell phone conversations on an aircraft now!!   ",,,,,,,

People will not be considerate of their neighbors, or if inclined to - with the shrinking aisle, seat room - we are traveling on top of each other - and do not need the added intrusion.

I would NOT be in favor of approving the use of mobile devices for voice calls on aircraft.  In such a confined space, the noise level could become worse than a high school lunch room especially given that most people, for some unknown reason to me, talk much louder on a cell phone vice a land line phone.

Now with the advent of cell phones, I know when others are on their cell phones-they speak loudly. When on a flight and someone is speaking loudly enough to be overheard, does their business on the phone now become my business and I can comment about the conversation as I feel? I recently was on an Amtrak trip that was only 24-hours long. At 3:00 AM, the gentleman two seats behind me apparently decided to change his ringtones, testing each sound option so that everyone could hear.  At ringtone number five, I evaluated my options - a) visit the closed dining car, b) go to the scenic part of the train that is glass enclosed where I could enjoy the scenic route in the dark, or c) politely ask him if he could perhaps choose another point of time in our journey to select ringtones for his phone. I chose option ""c"" which was closely followed by my hearing loudly, ""Wow, I don't believe it. This lady asked ME to do my phone some other time. Now, what am I supposed to do? I can't sleep. What are you doing?"" That was, to my great relief, followed by, ""Hey, are you still there? D*amn, I lost my signal again.""

It's bad enough that they're allowed on passenger trains (except in quiet cars, and some rude idiots can't keep their mouths shut even then) and buses, and riders are so often subjected to endless loud conversations of other passengers.   

It's difficult for me to understand why there's even any debate about allowing it.   Why would the DOT want to allow such annoying, disruptive, intrusive and rude behavior?   More then a small amount of shampoo is too dangerous to bring on board a commercial flight, but potentially subjecting paying customers to hours of loud drivel isn't a problem?  Couldn't  possibly increase the risk of physical harm or at the least increased levels of blood pressure among other passengers?  Get real.   It's bad enough boarding the plane behind people who block you while talking on their cell, who slow down boarding (it's hard to cram your over-sized bag that should've been checked into an overhead bin while talking on your cell, you know?) and who talk and talk and talk until they're finally told they have to shut off their phone because the plane's going to take off.   Some of those people will NOT SHUT UP for an entire 4 to 7 hour flight if they're not forced to.   Perhaps the DOT is aware of the woman Amtrak passenger who made the lives of other passengers a misery by talking for 10 hours?   Who was finally taken off a train for her behavior when finally told to get off the phone that she was bothering other people?  Does the DOT REALLY believe that only rail passengers are that self-centered?   

If people can't text, then the message can wait.   People have managed FOR YEARS without continual contact or communication with family, friends, employees, co-workers, and employers.   They can now experience it w/e-mail, texting --they don't ALSO need to talk.   There is just no reason to allow a behavior that (1) isn't essential (text or e-mail will be available modes of communication) (2) is already known to be so disruptive and unpleasant for anyone forced to be in the area of the perpetual talker.   

It is incredibly stupid to expect people to be polite, courteous and considerate of others.   Too many are not.  Flying is an uncomfortable, unpleasant experience as it is, and is likely to get even worse (even smaller/narrower seats,etc), why would the DOT decide to increase the possibility of it becoming a living hell?  Children who cry for 4 hours straight isn't a sufficiently bad audio experience?   At least with the children, they are often too young (and their parents too stupid) to understand what they're inflicting on those around them or able to control themselves.   Cellphone talkers aren't and yet they don't.  So don't enable them.",,,,,,,

Well... what is it that's SO important that you can't wait a few hours ?  I mean, sure, if the plane is going down and you want to say good-bye to your loved ones, I doubt the flight attendants will take the time to lecture you - but think of what we (the passengers who enjoy flying in peace) already have to put up with.
After waiting for an hour or longer at the gate, while the business-person sitting next to you carries on a VERY vocal conversation via their mic/earplug that apparently picks up nothing softer than a scream.... or while the college kids replays last night's party with their friend, starting each sentence with ""Dude, dude, dude..."" and sprinkling it with numerous ""like""'s... we THEN get onto the plane and take our seats next to (or near) that beautiful cooing baby, and fight for armrest room with the person next to us who should have booked 2 seats while the person behind us jams their knees into our back through the seat because they're 6'-03"" tall.  Annnnnd... we get wheels-up.  And the baby becomes possessed by the eardrum-pressure demons.
Let's just add another person into the mix, who NOW has to yell over the engine noise, the friendly chatter, the screaming baby, and the behemoth next to us who snores like a tank !!  Oh yeah... and all they wanted to do was tell their buddies about last night's party !!

As a frequent air traveler, I am familiar with the many stressful situations that passengers already face.  Placing dozens of strangers in a cramped, confined space for several hours already makes for an unpleasant experience, and enabling cell phone calls during that time would be even more disruptive for fellow travelers.  Use of non-transmitting portable electronic devices during the entire flight has already made my travel experience much more pleasant, providing a quiet, unobtrusive means of work or entertainment while traveling.  However, allowing voice calls during flights would not only be highly disruptive to both other passengers and flight crew, it is also unnecessary given the other communication options available to fliers.

The nuisance of being subjected to other travelers' cell phone conversations is one that is unavoidable by passengers.  According to page 10 of the proposed regulation, ""the Department has found acts to be “unfair” if they are harmful to 
passengers but could not be reasonably avoided by passengers"".  Being confined to a small seat, with few options for moving elsewhere to avoid the noise of seatmates' cell phone conversations, would have a large, negative impact on the air travel experience.  As noted in the proposed regulation, people tend to talk longer and more loudly on cell phones than they would during conversations with fellow travelers.  Moreover, I believe that frustration with phone-using seatmates could lead to more frequent conflict with other travelers, causing difficulty not only for travelers but for airline crew.  Even under the current regulations, I have witnessed travelers who refused to end cell phone conversations when asked to do so by a flight attendant, causing delays and increased stress for everyone on the plane, and making it harder for flight crew to do their jobs.

There are other options available for passengers who wish to communicate while flying.  I would be pleased to be able to use my phone's text messaging or data capabilities while in flight.  In addition, many flights now offer in-flight internet access.  Travelers can email or chat while in flight, allowing them to stay connected without disrupting fellow travelers.  Voice calls, while potentially contributing to productivity for some travelers, also make it hard for other travelers to focus on their own work.  While it is technologically possible to make voice calls over the internet, I feel that these should also not be allowed, as they would be just as disruptive to travelers and crew as cell phone calls would be.    

I feel that text-to-speech software, as referenced on page 16 of the proposed regulation, is not the same thing as a voice call and should be exempt from any ban.  The proportion of passengers who need to use this functionality is likely very small as compared to the total number of passengers, making it unlikely that such software would be disruptive, and the point of any such regulation should be to enhance passengers' safety and comfort.  Those passengers who need text-to-speech software should be allowed to use it with headphones. 

I see no need for a talking area or physical separation of phone-users from those who are not using phones as referenced on page 18, item 10 of the proposed regulation; in fact, I believe that this would be worse than an outright ban.  As passengers, we do not always have control over our seat assignments.  Getting rebooked due to travel delays or cancellations is already stressful enough, and often results in getting an undesirable seat assignment; even worse would be the possibility of being stuck in the ""talking zone"".  Having a designated talking zone would simply limit seat choices even further, and requiring an enclosure would entail additional costs to airlines without necessarily solving the problem.  Sound travels, and those passengers sitting near the talking zone would likely still be subjected to unpleasant noise levels.

Based upon my experiences as a passenger, I am convinced that the disruptive nature of voice calls exceeds the potential benefits to a few travelers.  I urge the DOT to allow all other mobile wireless communications services in flight, but to ban voice calls.",,,,,,,

Allowing phone calls on these flights would make all the hours of travel completely excruciating. People already talk louder on cell phones than they do when talking to their neighbors. The loud ambient noise from the engines would cause those speaking on phones would exacerbate this to the point that the plane would sound like a bevy of Dick Vitales all calling different ballgames over the roar of engines. Painful. [You already mention this point, sans Dick Vitale, on p.11 of your notice.]

In the notice, you mention the idea of having 'quiet sections' of the plane on p. 14.  Perhaps this could be rephrased as allowing 'loud sections' or even something akin to phone booths to isolate the callers. The downside of having such regions on the plane, however, would be that the airlines would then figure out a way to charge more for the quiet seats.

You mention that there could be people who would like to use their phones for 'important business or personal calls' on p. 16. There are many people under the mistaken notion that all their calls are important, so making such a distinction would be futile. Those who claim they need such calls should have long-since realized that there are times at which they simply cannot be in touch via voice, and they should learn other mechanisms for communicating. Some of us like to be able to work on a plane in an environment that is no worse than working in a bus station. Cell phone usage would make this work environment far worse because of the proximity of the loud voices talking into cell phones.

You mention text-to-voice applications on p.17. This is somewhat beside the point, because the problem is with voice-to-phone. Those needing text-to-voice can wear headphones, just like those who like to listen to music. (In this context, allowing conversation would be analogous to allowing people to play instruments on the plane.)

Do what you would like with texting and other globally social, locally antisocial behavior, but please save us from having to hear extremely loud half-conversations for hours on end.",,,,,,,

There's enough to deal with over the timeframe of a flight in general.  I myself don't want to sit next to someone constantly and probably loudly talking on their cell phone.  What if someone wants to relax or sleep on a flight?  Do you have zones in the airplane-quiet, talk, etc?  I don't think this is feasible and not a smart idea.  If you think there are problems with passengers now, wait until you potentially introduce cell phones.  People are not respectful using cell phones in public now, they also use them when they drive and shouldn't,  that will just be worse in a confined space of an airplane",,,,,,,

Please, for the sake of what few good things remain about flying, do not permit people to make in-flight cell phone calls.  ",,,,,,,

Although cell phone use no longer posed a technological threat to navigation and aeronautic safety, what some are ignoring is the hazard cell phones present to the well-being and peace of mind of passengers confined inside the cabin of a plane with nowhere to flee while rude seatmates incessantly yakked away.
 
If cell phone voice calls were permitted, flight attendants would be placed in the impossible position of having to referee disputes between passengers who, jammed tightly into their seats on packed planes, argued over telephone etiquette and common courtesy (which is no longer so common at all). Travelers would demand to be moved; when no others seats were available, hand-to-hand combat might break out. On a street or in a public building, you can always walk away from a loud and obnoxious cell phone user. On a plane? Where are you supposed to go?
 
There is a simple solution to satisfy those who wish to communicate with people on the ground during a flight: Allow text messages, e-mails and social network postings from the air. Engaging in those activities actually calms passengers, soothes their nerves. Voice calls? The opposite

I would like to strongly encourage the DOT and FAA to NOT allow making or receiving calls or talking on cell phones, period. Due to no real feedback when using a cell phone you can’t hear yourself talk thru the phone, so most people talk very loud on the phone. I couldn’t imagine people trying to hear a phone conversation over the engine and wind noise of a jet aircraft. Then talking very loud or screaming to the other person on the call due to the lack of voice feedback thru the PDA.

Next thing you know you have passengers yelling at each other to be quiet, other passengers claiming they have the legal right, etc. Next you’ve invented “air-rage” like road rage but on a commercial flight. Who’s to dictate what’s too loud? The passengers, a flight attendant, the DOT, FAA? Right now things are nice. Folks put on their head sets, listen to music, watch TV, read or sleep. Having loud phone conversations will only make flying more miserable for everyone.

Thank you for allowing our input.",,,,,,,

I do NOT support cell phone use on flights.  

I just read an article in my local paper regarding the use of cell phones on planes.  I did not read the 22 page document associated with this issue.

Bottom line: PLEASE, please do NOT allow the use of phones on planes.  Reasons noted in the article include: [1] people tend to talk louder on cellphones; on a flight the potential exists for longer conversation; [2] concern for the accumulative impact of allowing in flight calls in an enclosed cabin; [3] creates a negative impact on an already stressful (and sometimes testy) flight experience; [4] flight attendants oppose lifting the ban for reasons (i.e., passenger management issues; increase cabin noise).

Frankly, in general, people have horrible cell phone etiquette.  On the ground I can escape such things; in the air I am trapped.  

Let's just not go there.

While it's nice to believe that people will self regulate, current experience in theaters, libraries, hospitals, museums, and other environments in which whispered communication and/or silence was considered the norm, demonstrates that there always will be those among us who disregard those norms. 

Moreover, I regularly see on flights men and women who blatantly disregard aircraft personnel when asked to power off cell phones and other electronic devices just before take off and/or landing.  If staff are unable to effectively manage this behavior, why consider adding yet another level of passenger activity that will not be managed properly.  

Finally, in an environment as confined as that of an airplane, it would just be annoying to have to listen to a person's conversation when I might be tired, or traveling to a funeral (or some other stressful life event), and just be in need of some time to think and be silent. ",,,,,,,

Add to that, some rude passenger yacking on the phone, being loud and obnoxious?  That is a guaranteed recipe for air-rage.  I urge you to please not allow passengers to make or receive phone calls on their personal mobile devices while in-flight on commercial airplanes.

Flying has already become a nearly intolerable experience: long lines for TSA security checks, overcrowded terminals, even more overcrowded airplanes, reduced leg room, overabundance of carry-on baggage, and passengers who are already in arguments about reclining seats and shared armrests.

The very simple and obvious facts are that the American people (and foreign visitors) are increasingly inconsiderate.  You can rarely sit in an airline gate area without having to move or listen to two or three personal conversations.  Before the door of airplanes are closed you have to hear banal phone calls of people telling others that they are ""on the airplane"" and upon touchdown at destination you can't hear landing announcements for the number of other passengers advising callees that the are ""on the ground"".  

Can you possibly consider allowing a situation that puts an airline passenger in a middle seat without use of either armrest, scrunched up with minimal legroom - and now have to listen to innumerable nonsense conversations.  How many of these calls can you possibly think will be of any real importance and not something that could easily be accomplished at either end of the flight?  Certainly, if safety is not impacted, texting would be more than sufficient (and still annoying on overnight flights).",,,,,,,

An aircraft is a confined area especially in cases when there is full flight and having people talk on their cell phones inside the aircraft would be extremely disruptive to the flight experience. There are many other ways to communicate using portable electronic device such as, texting, which is less disruptive. Texting allows passengers to communicate while being on the aircraft without being so disruptive to fellow passengers. It would be to presumptive to expect passengers to respect their fellow passengers and not talk on their phones in a rude or loud manner. I think the best way to regulate this activity is not to allow voice calls at all unless it is prior to take off. Creating ""quiet areas"" would not be good use of space on an aircraft given that most aircraft are already pressed for space. 

The DOT should ban passenger voice communication through portable electronic devices on aircrafts.

There is a niche opportunity for new and existing business to cater services towards consumers who want to make in-flight voice calls and are willing to pay for the privilege. The fact that a majority of consumers oppose voice calls in flight suggests that the carriers would not abuse passengers by foisting the choice onto them industry-wide. So long a reasonable number of practicably affordable flights are “voiceless,” or that voice use is curtailed in such a way as to minimize cumulative noise impacts on passengers, consumers have a reasonable means of avoidance and the practice is not “unfair” under § 41712. If airlines are ceded the authority to develop customary policies and procedures for self-regulating the use of voice calls, the market will necessarily adapt (and conceivably, innovate) to address passenger comforts; there would be no such impetus is a ban is adopted. If the use of voice calls ultimately (through cumulative use, changing behavior) rises to the level of a health and safety threat, or is so discomforting and unavoidable as to constitute an unfair practice and/or interfere with the air service, the OST should then issue a NPRM, but not before, especially where the anticipated downside of failure for lack of regulation is merely passenger “discomfort.” ",,,,,,,

If you allow voice calls on the plane without deterrents, you will end up with similar situations to public transportation where you will always find at least one idiot who talks way too loudly, gives way too much info (for example a few days ago, some idiot was talking loudly, laughing even louder while talking about some lady's fat ***, and then getting angry and getting aggressive when people look his way instead of minding their business, even though he is yelling loud enough for everyone on the bus to hear (and likely people outside of the bus)

The cell phone rules in restaurants are seldom enforced by waitstaff because they know it's an impossible task. Even though air transport is not like a restaurant, the passenger enters into a passive state for the duration that has quite a lot of the same expectations of eating in a restaurant. I personally think telling someone to turn off their cell phone is a lot like telling the mother of a crying baby to silence their child. There just isn't going to be a positive result.

In addition, with flights already short-staffed by flight attendants, I expect that most of their time would be spent mediating such disputes. An already exhausting and annoying process (flying generally - to include arriving early, checking in, security, boarding and then finally flying to yout destination) would be greatly diminished to the point that some people, myself included, would restrict myself to flying only when absolutely necessary.

These are offensive enough in the airports and during loading and unloading (I will not call the way passengers are treated by the airlines in the U.S. ""De-planing,"" etc.)  Because of the poor directionality of all modern cell phone microphones and their tiny speakers, users must speak loudly or even shout.  The usually high ambient noise level in airport boarding areas and aboard aircraft in flight make this even worse.  Lastly, our airlines pack us in like sardines in order to maximize their profits.  We have seen services on board disappear one by one and the comfort of the traveling public is increasingly degraded.  Allowing passengers to shout into their cell phones on board aircraft will just add to the claustrophobia and discomfort of our passengers.

While I support relaxing the rules for other data uses (i.e. allow internet access from a browser, use of cloud services such as DropBox, spreadsheets connected to a common server for business, email and the like) these are common sense uses that do not detract from the flying experience for those around the data user.  That cannot be said for using cell phones for verbal communication, and studies have shown that cell phone users use a louder voice when talking on a cell phone than when talking to someone face to face (like their seatmate.)  
  There are certain things that I just can not control when flying, like a crying baby seated behind me.  I understand that and realize that is part of the flying experience.  I also understand that the DOT has allowed the airlines to enhance their revenue stream by using add-on charges or by putting in one (now two) more extra seats in a row than the plane was designed for.  That has impacted the flying experience as well and while I don't like it, I can choose to limit its impact by my flying habits.  This is the world we live in.
  However, the use of cell phones for voice calls goes beyond this and strays into the realm of the social compact.  Just as we will not allow (and I hope the DOT is not going to allow) someone to connect a speaker to their iPad or mobile device and use Garage Band (or their digitized music already on the device) to play music at a loud (say, 80 decibels- the sound of a 'quiet' food blender) level because they have the ability, I hope you will not allow someone to sit in a seat next to me and talk loudly on a cell phone for the duration of the flight because they have the ability.  If it is a communication issue then they can communicate (using email, SMS text, etc.)  but PLEASE do not allow voice communication.",,,,,,,

Now imagine people trying to sleep and people on their cellphones claiming ""its my right,"" ""its my personal freedom"" and that unfounded road.  They have WiFi on most aircraft now.  Let them put their phones in airplane mode, connect to the WiFi and send texts via it. That is at least quite and acceptable.  And even with that their phones should be required to be on silent.

I just sat thru a flight with 6 guys YELLING the WHOLE FLIGHT.  EVERYONE on the plane was glaring at them.  The FA told them to be quiet.  Passengers told them to calm down.  We told them to calm down.  Nothing.  Now imagine 50 ppl or more on phones and pissing everyone off.

Secondly, the air travel experience is challenging enough:  getting through security, the boarding process, the small confines of the plane and being in close proximity to others. Allowing passengers to talk on cell phones during the flight means the nonstop banter of the business person ""thinking outside the box"" and dealing with the ""paradigm shift.""  It means listening to people talking too loudly into their phones.  It means two to three hours of listening to people regurgitate the minutiae of their day, their week, their lives.

I fly about 40,000 miles per year, some for business and primarily for pleasure. I treasure my in-flight time for resting, working, catching up on reading or just ""quiet"" time. This would be impossible if such voice calls were allowed in flight.
   Our brains are wired to try to fill in the blanks of the other side of the conversation we hear, which, we obviously, cannot do.  Hence it is extremely distracting to involuntarily hear one side of another person's cellphone conversation. It is not just ""white"" noise. Furthermore, the content of other persons' calls may be even more distracting, annoying or intemperate.
    Please leave this one place in our too-busy world free of this use of technology.
    I would also object to allowing mobile voice calls in just a portion of the aircraft. As we learned with smoking cigarettes on airplanes, the practice is bothersome to others even if they are not sitting close to the smoker. The same would be true if persons in certain rows were allowed to use their mobile devices to make voice calls at will on an aircraft in flight.

The answer:  People can walk away from a loud, disruptive, rude person on a beach or in a store, but that is not an option on an airplane.

If there is no safety risk, approve texting and surfing the web, but definitely ban talking on cell phones during all flights, not just ones at night.

After this, please work on the fact that the seats are getting so small it is ridiculous and would be a hazard in the event of a crash.

Can you imagine a five hour flight sitting among people screaming on their cellphones? and getting louder and louder to heard.

BAN any voice call on a plane. 
People with urgent business can use text instead, so there is no way they are cutoff from their offices, bosses or family
when in a plane now.

Flying is stressful for many reasons, excessive noise and distractions throughout the travel experience being one of the main reasons.  Though commercial aircraft cabins are not especially quiet, they can offer a respite from an otherwise stressful experience.  By adding the capability for voice calls on wireless devices, the atmosphere would become tense and distracting that it already often is.  It is very difficult to read or sleep when someone nearby is carrying on an intense business-related conversation. 

Therefore, NO mobile calls on aircraft.

Occasionally I will see passengers keep using their phones after the FAs have announced that the doors are closed and all passengers should discontinue the use of cell phones.  If the use of cell phones were approved, I could see some people, who are so engrossed in their conversations, miss important announcements over the aircraft PA system, endangering themselves and their fellow passengers.",,,,,,,

Nobody will hear announcements made by the pilots and flight attendants, people will pay less attention to the flight attendants talking directly to them than they already do, and people will likely feel more stressed having all that noise going on around them....and these could be DOT concerns.

As a flight attendant, I get to observe the entire cabin while doing the FAA required safety demonstration.  It was once a priority to get the attention of everyone on board while we perform it.  Now the decision has been made that passengers' personal communications are more important than knowing what to do in a potential evacuation.   I am required by the FAA to attend a safety refresher every year that includes airplane evacuations.  Is it too much to ask the passengers to participate in the safety of everyone on board each time they fly? What if I was allowed to be on my computer or phone during my annual training rather than participate in the safety details that I am required to review?  How would that serve everyone in a potential evacuation?  
I strongly disapprove of passengers being able to have telephone conversations in flight.  The quarters are far too close and I have observed that people generally speak much more loudly on the phone than in a normal conversation.  I don't think that it is fair to subject people that are not directly involved in someone's business to be forced into it by having to listen to a conversation that in no way involves them.  And besides that, I personally don't want to be forced into policing any displeasure with the issue because I am the authority in the cabin!  I also don't want people taking my photograph and posting it for the world to see because they don't understand protocol on an airplane.  
I fear that our lawmakers have been lobbied  too strongly on this issue and that reason has lost its place in the argument.  We have moved swiftly with the use of technology on airplanes in the last few years providing passengers with many options to communicate or entertain themselves.  Before long, most legacy carriers with have WiFi on every flight.  So opportunities to commentate are more prolific than ever.
But telephone conversations, after the airplane door is closed, are taking these freedoms too far. ",,,,,,,

Most people are already easily irritable on an airplane especially after having gone through extensive secuirty checks, long lines and possible delays. In a small and constrained space where tensions are already running high it is easy to set off an altercation among two parties both of whom want to exercise their rights; the right to use the phone and the right for peace and quiet. Today we have few such issues since cellphone usage is restricted. As someone who travels frequently (twice a week) for work and uses my time onboard to either catch up on work or sleep, I really do not want to be disturbed by someone who wants to discuss ""keeping up with the kardashains"" with their friends.

Moreover such a rule would be inconsistent with the rest of the world where mobilephone use inflight still remains banned. American users used to using cellphones in flight will only be asking for altercations when they refuse to comply with rules aboard foreign carriers by citing US rules.",,,,,,,

It is already bad enough being forced to listen in to the braying of the business class, jabbering away with anything but an indoor voice along the entire walkway and aisle as they board, and then while seated until the Attendant announces the door has been closed.

I though trains were bad enough, but at least one can move around a bit more.

There's nowhere to go on a plane.

It would be awful to endure row-mates making extended calls.  But imagine the spirit dampening din oozing from row upon row behind you, as scores of very important people collectively project their voices to the front of the plane.

The engine noise and the sound of the air conditioning or air circulation would prompt callers to boost their voices ever louder, in the misguided belief that they can't otherwise be heard over the racket.  This would be worse than sharing a ride in a taxi with someone making a cell phone call.

There'd be no sleeping, nor actual working on laptops in the event voice calls are routinely allowed.  And, frankly, i'm certain there are some who might react in a manner similar to those who have prompted the disappearance of peanuts aboard aircraft.

I'm confident there are no actual safety issues -- or this proposed rule would never have reached as far as a comment level.  And I'm sure most aren't deeply disturbed by the frequent calls placed once the plane has touched down, and connections and rides are contacted.

But please consider the cramped, confined space where passengers aboard routinely full planes struggle for comfort in order to endure the hours aloft.  Please don't subject us all to a phone booth with wings.

Thank you.",,,,,,,

This is clearly a matter of air-travel safety.  Allowing in-flight cellular voice-calls would be the straw that breaks the camel's back.  Air travel is already a miserable experience due to a combination of intrusive security, shrinking seat size, airline overbooking practices that are designed -- and typically succeed -- in full or near full flights, reduced services, luggage fees that cause more and more travelers to hog carry-on space, etc..  As a result, on any flight of any duration, nerves and tempers are already on edge.  And now we're contemplating putting entire cabins at the mercy of every inconsiderate, self-important, cellphone-addicted ass who can't go a few hours without flapping their yaps?  That is guaranteed to produce in-flight confrontations that will not only pose a danger to flight-crews and passengers, but that will also disrupt airline scheduling as flights are diverted due to in-flight fistfights.  Of  course, because these fights will have occurred in the ""special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States"" per Title 42 of the U.S. Code, it will then be necessary for the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Offices to get involved -- as if Federal law-enforcement has the time or assets to take on even more work.

I am a retired U.S. Marine officer, and have also served as a U.S. DOJ prosecutor for the past 11 years, so I am not especially delicate.  Also, when I travel, it's almost always in coach.  I'm therefore as qualified as any to express an informed opinion on this matter.  The proposal to allow in-flight voice-calls is as profoundly unwise as it is unnecessary.

I would hope that the Department of Transportation will continue the ban on in-flight cellphone calls. I cannot comment on the safety aspects of cell phone use during flights, but I have very definite opinions on the impact of cell phone use in flight on the experience of airplane travel.

Airplane seating is very closely spaced.  It is usually not possible to change one's seat, or even move around freely. Many people are already listening to and watching devices through which sounds seep. Having to try to tune out the conversations of people in nearby seats will further degrade a travel experience that has become only marginally bearable.

Adding voice calls to the ever shrinking confines of a commercial airline would be like sending passengers to hell with gasoline underpants. Already you can feel air on your neck every time the passenger next to you takes a breath, and inane incessant chatter (which it always is when you are listening to a one sided conversation) would be asking for trouble. Air travel is already stressful, the aggrieved party cannot take flight away from an annoying passenger, so they may choose to fight. The airlines have already done an excellent job turning its passengers into cattle, don't slaughter the poor cattle by forcing them to listen to their seat mate's phone call.

With the incessant drone of the airplane, whispering on a call would not be an option, with heightened travel security walking away, to stand in the aisle, is not be an option. We know from experience (movie, restaurant, church, public transportation) that expecting most people on a phone call to show consideration for others within their vicinity is an exercise in futility.  Expecting patience and rationality from a person who feels trapped listening to another person's phone call is unrealistic.

The argument could be made that we survived passengers making phone calls on airlines before, but Airphone never moved beyond the the novelty stage and the cost of the calls kept them brief and infrequent.

In a perfect world there would be no need for regulations to control behavior, but just as there is a need for speed limits and seat belt laws we need one to prevent anarchy in the air.",,,,,,,

Flying in 2014 is not glamorous like it once was.  Fares are low, cabins are full and most passengers appear to have left their manners at home.  Many passengers today are simply rude, expecting the world for the $129 non-refundable fare and want endless service from the cabin staff.  Add the allowance to make cellphone voice calls to this mix of humanity and flying will be nothing more than a bus with wings.  Those of us that have to fly weekly for work take the few hours in the plane as a time to be electronically disconnected from the world 35,000 below our feet.  There is nobody that important that requires instant voice to voice contact.  If one really needs to contact someone on the ground, allow passengers to SILENTLY text/message only!  There is no need for voice to voice cellphone calls TO or FROM an aircraft in flight.

Having the most inane conversation in the world happening next to me where I can't get up will only make it worse. Then you will have those business people who are trying to run their empire from right next to you; that will suck. Lastly you will have the nervous flyer who natters and not only annoys you but annoys someone 2000 miles away. 

I want you to think about sitting next to Vicky Pollard on a flight from LA-NYC. Just check YouTube for Vicky Pollard and you will realize that no human should have to sit near that for 6+ hours on a phone. 

Now you are probably looking for some technical reason to stop phone use so I will give you a good one. If you are a frequent flyer and you end up next to Vicky Pollard you might find yourself buying a Cellphone jammer so that on your next flight you can shut her up. But what on earth would a cellphone jammer do to an airplane? So now you have some businessman sitting with smug self satisfaction that the nattering has stopped but potentially so has the nattering in the cockpit with people on the ground; or the navigation system, or some other bit that is needed to keep the airplane in the sky. You might think that most people would know that turning on such a device would be bad for their health but remember that a goodly number of people think that the sun goes around the earth and basically have no real idea how modern technology works. Think of this as a whole new form of air rage. Plus would a business flyer so stupid as to use a cellphone jammer realize that it is his fault that the airplane is now in a spin toward the ground? Would the crash investigation team think to look for such a cause? 

I don't fly much but please not only save me from Vicky Pollard but save me from the business man with anger management issues and his cellphone jammer.

I am responding to the Use of Mobile Wireless Devices for Voice Calls on Aircraft NPRM. I am currently an Ohio State student majoring in aviation with an interest in the airline industry. It has come to my attention that this NPRM looks to restrict passengers voice calls on wireless cellular devices when the aircraft is in flight due to possible issues of voice calls being unfair or distracting to others on the aircraft; being more specific, during pre-flight safety briefings or night time. This response will cover the responses and effects of public opinion on the restriction of wireless cellular calls in flight.

Summary of response:

Airline surveys of their passengers show that a majority of passengers believe that their flying experience would be negatively affected by allowing calls in flight.

Cell phone voice calls are considered to be ruder than face to face conversations so passengers are negatively affected by listening to the user use their cell phone.

In response to the NPRM question 2:Information on the possible benefits of allowing voice communications on passengers' mobile wireless devices on flights conducted under 14 CFR Part 91 Subpart K (fractional ownership programs), Part 121 (generally scheduled airlines and charter operators of large aircraft), Part 125 (operations with aircraft having 20 or more passenger seats where common carriage is not involved), Part 129 (foreign air carriers), and/or Part 135 (commuter, on demand and air-taxi operations) within, to and from the United States. Are there airlines that would opt to provide this service to passengers, should the opportunity arise? Are there passengers or passenger groups that would like to be allowed to use their mobile devices for voice communications while in flight (e.g., anytime, for important business or personal calls, emergencies)? Whether or not the Department should refrain from issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking on this topic and instead allow the airlines to develop individual policies.

The ban should include all voice calls no matter what mode it is made through. “Since the lift on the wireless devices ban set forth by the FCC there has been an FAA announcement that airlines can safely allow passengers to use all PEDs during all phases of flight.” So the safety aspect on whether or not cellular phones should be allowed has been addressed but passenger satisfaction and opinions hasn’t been. Through a survey done by “Delta Airlines they found that 64 percent of their passengers believe that allowing cellular voice calls on flights would have a negative impact on their onboard experience.” This addresses the fact on whether or not voice calls are an unfair practice and should be restricted or banned. “Southwest Airlines chairman and CEO Gary Kelly stated that Southwest customers don’t want that option if the long-time ban is lifted.” By taking into consideration the results and comments from these two major airlines it’s clear that a majority of flyers don’t want to listen to people using their cellular devices to make voice calls while onboard the aircraft. 

In response to NPRM question 12: Whether permitting in-flight voice calls is more or less disruptive than other current in-flight “disruptions,” such as in-person conversations between passengers If so, why?

Studies done by Jonathan Forma, a Digital Analytics Director, have shown that face to face conversations are considered less rude than cellular voice calls. Through his study he found that people on average talk louder on their cellular devices than when they talk to people face to face. The volume of their voice has been shown to increase with increases in background noise such as other conversations and noises made by the bus he performed his study. The conclusion of his results showed that “The ‘need to listen’ explanation is basically that participants have a desire to hear both sides of the conversation, and the frustration at only being able to hear one side of the conversation produces higher rudeness ratings for the groups where only one side of the conversation is heard.” This experiment found that people were generally more annoyed with people talking on cell phones than people having a conversation between each other face to face because the other passengers couldn’t hear both parts of the conversation with the cell phone user.

Thank you for providing this forum to express an opinion regarding cell phone usage aboard operating, in-flight aircraft.

My opinion is a resounding no to the use of cell phones aboard in-flight aircraft.  It is common experience that most people generally speak louder than normal while using cellular phones in public areas in order to deal with the perception that they must speak loudly to overcome background noise.  As you may be aware, the background noise level of an operating, in-flight aircraft is quite high.  Such noise levels are created by, among other things, loud engines, wind and passenger conversations.  Since, during normal public area cell phone operations, people speak quite loudly, it is my opinion that they will tend to speak extremely loud during in-flight operations which will be a considerable annoyance to travelers in the close confines of an aircraft cabin, such as myself, who routinely fly for business.  

I have resolved that, should cellphone usage be permitted aboard in-flight aircraft, I will not patronize airlines that allow such usage.  ",,,,,,,

Expanded usage would lead to a deterioration of the temporary flight commons. Increased  overall cabin volume levels and potential for conflict between passengers are at least two of the predicted/potential negative effects. Another potential problem is that flight personnel will surely be called upon to solve/resolve potential conflicts thus diverting them from their other duties. I agree with the statements contained in the filing noted below completely.

""The Association of Flight Attendants filed a comment and replied that voice over internet or cellular broadband should be banned to reduce in-flight disruptions, noting that most flight attendants and travelers find objectionable the possibility of numerous simultaneous voice calls.""

Having 300 people in a cramped, enclosed space for hours on end with, say, 10% of them at any given time talking (loudly) into their phones would make flights unendurably noisy. It's important, when you are forced to be cheek by jowl and shoulder to shoulder with a horde of strangers, to be able to maintain a sense of privacy; allowing cellphone use would destroy this entirely. You would be always in the presence of at least one person shouting to make himself or herself heard above engine noise and the surrounding crowd. And these conversations would probably be long ones; the caller has nothing very much else to do, after all.

One of the least-liked ""types"" of fellow passengers is the loud talker, whose conversation intrudes on the thoughts and quiet conversations of everyone within 3 rows and seats. Allowing cellphone use on flights would institutionalize this intrusion and to no real benefit. Cellphone use would provide entertainment and distraction from boredom, not usually anything critical to anyone's well-being. 

The effect this rule would have on the mood of the planeload of people would be significant and negative. Think of yourself in this situation: you are sitting next to someone talking, laughing, discussing family matters, all at a volume that can't be ignored. What do you do? You can ask them to talk more softly, but they can't, since the engine noise requires you speak up so you can be heard at all. You can ask them to hang up because they're talking too loud and you can't hear yourself think; they'll refuse, since they're having a perfectly good time. Later you'll *tell* them to hang up; they'll refuse, probably rudely. So you tell the flight attendant, who has no legal basis for telling them to hang up, and must therefore appeal to reason and fair play--never a winning strategy. So there you are, sitting next to an ongoing noise source (or two or three) that will not shut up and cannot be compelled to do so. Imagine the frustration. You would certainly be wondering what you have in your possession that you could use to force them to quiet down; what do have that you could use as a cudgel?

Now multiply by 300. 

Managing the mood of a planeful of people is an important component to running a flight. Allowing cellphone use on a flight will make this increasingly difficult. In any group of 300 individuals, there are a couple who don't handle frustration well; this rule sets up a situation where those individuals are tested more than any of us would like.

Finally, this would do the airlines no particular good. They would feel obliged to install the cell equipment on their planes and then would have to bear the consequent decrease in nearly everyone's desire to fly. They would end up spending money to make people like them less.

This rule would do a lot of real damage to the already marginal flying experience and would add nothing of real value. I urge the DOT to not adopt this rule.

If someone needs to speak with others, instead of voice communication, the use of E-mail or text messaging can be used.  There is already enough noise and confusion in an enclosed and sealed tube and I could very easily see people becoming aggressive to the point that someone could be injured in altercations which will occur as a result of using cell phones .

So I propose a compromise.  Let's create an isolated area on the airplane where phone calls are allowed, away from all other passengers and hopefully soundproofed to a certain degree.  There is no need for heavy modification, for many airplanes already have curtains and such to cut off areas of the airplane, so let's just designate a few of those areas as ""phone"" areas.  This way if someone absolutely needs to use a cellphone, they get to, yet at the same time the passengers looking for a couple hours relaxation away from the real world flying 30,000 feet high can still get to just relax and enjoy the ride.

I cannot imagine sitting in a cabin with these same inconsiderate individuals (for the most part) and have to listen to their cell phone chatter.

Airline frequent flyers and business travelers don't need this disturbance or distraction and we would be satisfied with email or text if we chose to use it. 

Want to offer phone service - make them pay and maybe they won't use it when they know they are roaming at an exorbitant rate. However, I will be the first to tell them - hang up or stop talking as my company just paid over a $1000 for the same seat you paid $300 for and I am trying to get some work done like ""important medical charts and records."" Does it matter what I am doing, I just don't want to listen to their chatter and welcome any opportunity to upgrade myself to FC, but then again, I am at the mercy of the jiffy jets. 

So NO to cell phone service at this time unless the airlines want to turn the jiffy jets into two cabins, cell phone talkers and the business folks who are busy working. At best, I pray for a ""jiffy jet"" with WiFi so I can work and most times - not happening.

If someone wanted to try to get a nap ( as many travellers do ), there would be little chance on an aircraft.

Allowing voice calls would open a whole litany of issues on flights which would lead to unnecessary arguments and distractions for the flight crews and other passengers.
No doubt, some carriers will try a to use 'quiet section' & likely try to charge extra for it.
I don't agree with this idea either, as it is a personal right not to be bothered,.. not an opportunity to cash in on something that should be standard in the first place.

As most people seem to agree, silent messaging is bearable and would be understandably convenient for quite a few passengers with minimal invasion of others' space. People have become dependant on being in touch and a tweak of the rules would go a long way into bringing travel in line with modern personal communication patterns.

The human systems are affected by microwaves as for example neuronal, vascular, heart, thyroid, thrombocyte, eyes, sleep disorders, behavior issues, diabetes, DNA damaging, cell membrane damaged, and radiation exposure is cumulative too.

Furthermore, the increasing number of persons who are electro-hypersensitive (EHS) would no longer be able to travel by plane. All together the chatter which would be produced and the additional hazard of aggressive behavior which might be produced by microwaves radiation within an enclosed Faraday cage might greatly increase airplanes incidents and accidents.

It would be much better and safer to keep the ban of wireless on airliners until new technologies like Li-Fi (light fidelity) are widely available within the next few years.

I have noticed in the past 10 years or so that people on their cell phone while waiting in the airport to board a flight have become much more distracting.  They tend to talk on their phone as if the person on the other end is not able to hear them.  That means that I am part of their private conversation whether I like it or not.  At least in the airport or even a restaurant, I always have the option to move if I am bothered by their talking.  In an airplane, I am stuck in the seat assigned for 30 minutes before departure until arrival at the destination.  DC to LA can easily be a 6+ hour trip including the time after boarding but before departure.
  
Although I know I can control my urges, I do believe that there will eventually be flare-ups between passengers who cannot control their urges.  If an obnoxious person is talking and their seatmate does not ask them nicely to please quiet down, things may get out of control very quickly.  Airline travel is already stressful enough.  Adding an annoying person close by who is talking until their battery dies is not something that I think I should have to endure, especially when I may have paid upwards of $500 for my ticket.  I and other passengers should have some consideration for their right to have a quiet flight since they paid for it.  Screaming kids is more like an act of God and cannot always be controlled.  But no passenger should have to right to knowing inflict noise pollution on fellow passengers.

Airlines are already installing Wi-Fi which could allow flyers to use email while in-flight.  There is nothing so important that a person cannot wait until they arrive at their destination to make a cell call.  I also believe that business travelers in particular will want to talk at length if calling is allowed.  They should be able to maintain all necessary contact via email while in flight.  When I was a senior officer in the USAF, I had a Blackberry.  I found myself responding to emails immediately even though the content of the email did not require my immediate response.  I found myself sometimes making a call in response instead of an email.  I fear that business travelers may also have a habit on the ground that they carry into the airplane in an environment that is not appropriate for their responses.

Please do not allow cell phone calls while in-flight as it is not fair to all the travelers who are NOT talking on a phone.  Almost every airline has phones on the plane for use.  Sure, they cost a lot to use, but they are there if someone has an emergency that they must respond to immediately.  Their rights would not be abridged as they would have an alternative way to make contact rather than use their cell phone.",,,,,,,

I'm sure each and every one of you has been in a restaurant where the person in the next booth is engaged in a conversation over the phone. Often the person is speaking loudly and I'm sure you found it annoying. 

Imagine this occurring in an airplane where other passengers have nowhere to go in order to escape this annoyance. Aside from the discomfort to other passengers, undoubtedly tempers will flare and lead to confrontations. It would be unavoidable.

The grueling process of actually going through TSA security and being herded onto the tiny, cramped airplane would be made even more unpleasant by the addition of cute ringtones and loud conversations about things best left in private.  

Beyond the annoyance factor, however, there's a safety issue to keep in mind.  Allowing electronic devices during takeoff and landing is dangerous enough - not because the devices themselves interfere with flight systems, but because distracted passengers might not be aware of a developing emergency, which is more likely to occur during takeoff and landing than it is in-flight.  Adding actual cell phone calls into the mix, and allowing them throughout the flight, further distracts passengers and makes it less likely that everyone can react quickly, calmly, and correctly if and when an emergency occurs.  

Instead of pondering the addition of cellphones to flights, why not think about regulating legroom, seat comfort, things like that?  ",,,,,,,

It is irritating enough to listen to a LOUD and sometimes VULGAR cell phone conversation in a public place, where people within 10 feet of the offending caller can hear quite distinctly all aspects of the talk.  Now there is consideration afoot to lift the cell phone ban on commercial airlines.

Imagine if you will the repercussions involving a similar conversation, as described above, in an aircraft when one objects to s person sitting in the next seat at a distance of 18-24 inches.  There wouldn't be enough flight attendants and sky marshals to stop an escalating confrontation that could ensue.

On the subject of text messaging and emails.  I would not have a problem with either, as long as there was quiet tapping and not talking. The ""beeps"" and ""boops"" emanating from some forms of personal communication devices would be as irritating as the voice conversations during a long 3-4 hour flight.

It amazes me that the FCC and the DOT would even consider lifting a ban that would have little beneficial effect.

What is wrong with people having only access to email and the internet during the flights?  They are not disconnected from the world and can still communicate socially, for business, and/or for family purposes.  They just would not be able to use their voices.  Those who truly feel a need to stay connected 24/7 almost all to a man, woman, or child, have a smart phone that can provide email and internet access.  That should be enough.

Allowing in-flight voice calls would make air travel--already an increasingly unpleasant experience--intolerable.  

To choose one out of the barrel of good reasons why this would be a bad idea, note for instance the difficult position that this policy would put the flight crew.  Already now their challenge is to keep people calm and comfortable even as while trapped in a small space with a large numbers of strangers.  In-flight voice calls and the attendant disagreements that come with them--you're talking too loudly, you're talking in a way that offends me, you're talking when I trying to work/read/sleep/watch TV, etc.--would result in a lot more in-flight disagreements and fights that the flight crew would have to respond to.  

Please do not amend or abandon the existing policy of not allowing in-flight voice calls.  If someone absolutely must communicate during a flight, let them text.

Best wishes,
Matt

But it's more than that. People who talk on cell phones and via skype don't realize how much more loudly they speak than in regular conversation. That would be exacerbated by the background thrum of the engines; Because they don't hear as well, with all that noise, they automatically raise their own voices.

On wi-fi -equipped planes, there is no real advantage to allowing voice phone or device conversation. People can text or email on the plane without turning it into a compact space jammed with screamers. The stress level would be unbearable; I would avoid flying whenever possible.

Furthermore, how would aircraft personnel REGULATE WHO can/cannot make a call at a specific time? 3) While some passengers may NOT make ""in-flight"" calls, their safety will AUTOMATICALLY be AT THE MERCY of someone making an ""in-flight"" call which is grossly unfair! 4) If the aircraft is endangered due to an in-flight cellphone call or calls (as soon as one passenger makes a call, other passengers will suddenly realize they NEED to make an ""in-flight"" call) and there is collateral damage, exactly WHO will be to blame? WHO should be SUED?  The passenger(s) who made the call(s)?  The Airline?  or The FAA?

Given one passenger is able to annoy everyone within a 10 foot radius (~20 or so people), and the penchant for already annoyed airgoers, this seems a recipe for conflict.  The flight attendants already have enough to do, but hoping one person on a phone does not annoy any of the 20 distracted people seems to be asking a lot.

We know that there are not many technical impediments to operate wireless communication gear on board an airplane with only some exceptions. After the events of 911 and all that the US has gone thru, the lost of lives in CONUS and those lost overseas we have to stop for a minute an analyze the actual implications of having unrestricted communication channels on board airplanes. What a great commodity? What an awesome way of spending your flight shooting debris, or maybe conducting business or perhaps coordinating an act of terrorism? Maybe a good idea would be to relax all TSA check points and only do irregular scanning of passengers and baggage. Have we as country lost perspective of the threats that still exist and have we lost respect for all those who fought and keep fighting to keep us safe? Have we gotten so fat and lazy that the need to use a cell phone overrides the preservation of life. If we provide the opportunity bad things will happen as evidenced by past events.
Now, the prohibition could be lifted only if all passengers agree to complete and I mean 100 percent surveillance and recording of all phone calls with real time analysis of the data so that the same discipline that is required from passengers in the cabin apply to the phone lines. There is no way that communications going out and coming into a commercial flight would not be monitored to every nibble of data being passed.Establish a comprehensive monitoring and action plan, fail proof and there should be no issues with lifting the ban. Lifting a ban without safety features will set the scenario for more disasters.

To Whom It May Concern:
This is a response to the Use of Mobile Wireless Devices for Voice Calls on Aircraft NPRM. I believe adopting a rule to ban voice communications on passengers’ mobile wireless devices on flights within, to and from the United States is the wisest course of action given the current state of the industry. The aviation industry, being as complex as it is, is not known for adopting new rules or regulations in a quick manner. However, there is good reason behind this. The country as a whole is very dependent on the safe and efficient operation of the industry, so changes that may affect the industry’s ability to transport over two million passengers per day in this manner must be closely studied and analyzed (www.rita.dot.gov). Having just passed new rules on the use of portable electronic devices (PEDs) on aircraft in late October of last year, I believe it is much too soon to attempt to allow inflight calls on mobile wireless devices. 
	Summary of Response Main Points
•	Insufficient time given to asses impact of recently relaxed PED regulations
•	Passenger discomfort/safety impacts
•	Inadequate proof that concentrated use of mobile phones for voice communications in commercial aircraft will not result in potentially dangerous interference
A very recent regulation was passed which allowed airlines to safely expand passenger use of PEDs during all phases of flight (www.faa.gov). This was a great victory for many, as it greatly increased passenger comfort and entertainment during flights. The testing that took place to analyze wireless devices’ effects on aircraft took several years as it needed to be proven that their use would not impact the functionality of cockpit systems and radios. With that being said, I feel as though it is unwise to suggest adding voice communications into this technological mix without first analyzing the status air travel after the expansion of PED’s. Having just implemented the new PED regulation in October of last year, not nearly enough time has passed to truly understand its impact, let alone begin adding more capabilities to the devices. In order to even consider adding voice communications, ample time must be given to be sure that the expanded use of PEDs continues without issue. Four months is hardly enough time to say for certain that their impact is negligible, and without evidence that the aviation system will continue to run smoothly, thought should not be given to further expanding PED capabilities. 
The use of mobile devices for voice communications also has a tremendous impact on passenger experience. A recent poll distributed by Associated Press-GfK showed that 48% of people were opposed to the use of cell phones for voice communication, while only 19% were in favor. This poll, as well as many others which yielded similar results, show that a majority of passengers are still against the use of mobile phones for voice communications. Flight attendants feel the same way; A recent quote by Corey Caldwell, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight Attendants, argued that “Allowing passengers to use cellphones during commercial flights will add unacceptable risks to aviation security, compromise a flight attendant’s ability to maintain order in an emergency, increase cabin noise and tension among passengers…” (www.huffingtonpost.com). She expresses a valid argument as she describes the safety risks that would be associated with in-flight mobile device calls, ranging from an increased workload for flight attendants to passenger confrontations. The potential problems far outweigh the benefits this service would provide, especially when one considers that fact that communication is no longer completely dependent on voice. Passengers can now use Facebook, Twitter, access emails, and the like, so adding yet another form of communication which brings along a slew of issues does not benefit anyone traveling commercially, whether it be passengers or crew. 
My final point in favor of a rule that bans voice communication on passengers’ mobile devices stems from the lack of conclusive research regarding the effect of mobile devices on aircraft systems when emitting a signal (not in “airplane mode”). While evidence showed that relaxing the rules on PEDs would not negatively affect these systems, no such definitive research exists for situations when mobile phone signals are being sent to and from ground stations. As reported in a CNN article, the risk of interference is low, but the consequences are high. During critical phases of flight, even small deviations of cockpit instruments due to interference can result in higher workload, higher stress situations for pilots. In fact, there were 75 instances of suspected electronic interference, including 29 related to mobile phones, reported by pilots between 2003 and 2009 (www.cnn.com). These interferences affected almost every aircraft system, revealing that interference cannot be predicted.

Please do not allow cell phone calls on air flights.  It would be unfair to force passengers to listen to the conversations of others, which are always louder when someone is on a cell phone.  There would be no peace in the skies at all.  I also think it is a possible safety issue.  Passengers are already crammed into uncomfortable spaces; air travel has become unpleasant.  The addition of the invasion of aural space by cell phone yammering could very easily lead to animosity between passengers and ultimately acting out.

If communication is so important to someone, they can send an email or text; they do not need to disturb everyone around them by talking on their phone.  People already talk louder when they talk on cell phones.  Additionally, airlines do not allow people to blast music or movies into the plane (instead they expect passengers to use headphones).  This is a clear recognition that unnecessary noise is aggravating to other passengers, and passengers talking on cell phones would be just as aggravating.

Cell phone use already creates a good deal of hostility between people in public places where people are not packed in together like sardines.  The airlines are already doing everything they can to create conflict between people (by packing seats closer together front to back, but not preventing seats from reclining (which especially is a problem as they pack seats closer together front to back), and by making seats narrower (so they can pack more seats in from side to side).  This means that someone talking on a cell phone is going to have his/her babbling mouth about 8 inches (or perhaps less)  from a total stranger.  What government regulators should be looking into is restricting airlines from packing people too closely in planes.  Airlines clearly are not capable of regulating themselves, because they have already demonstrated they have little common sense about human beings.",,,,,,,

While quiet texting does not disturb one's neighbors - and neighbors are VERY near in most seats - speaking on a phone is certainly going to be audible, especially as voices raise to be heard over airplane noise. There are various issues here:

(1) Courtesy:  basic politeness dictates that one not make private phone call in a stranger's hearing.  Subjecting strangers to one's conversation - when they cannot escape - is especially rude.  And yet we all know that many people will be rude, if phone calls are allowed on airplanes.

This is related to (2) Externalities.  In economic jargon, right now passengers have the right not to be subjected to others' phone calls.  Why change that?  

Shifting the rights to those who don't mind disturbing others may (3) lead to increased conflicts and violence in very small spaces. 

Surely courtesy and safety should be our priorities.

People tend to talk loudly on cell phones -- practically shouting.  I can imagine several very unpleasant situations.   What about the person who wants to read a book?  Or sleep?  Or just relax?  Or watch in the in-flight movie?  They are stuck sitting next to a person who is having a disturbing phone call -- perhaps using their phone the entire length of the flight, or having an argument on the phone.   It is not like they can get up and move to another location, as many flights are full, or they have to keep their seat belts on.  And if it is a parent sitting next to a child, then they would have to relocate both seats.  Also, people on cell phones are less mobile, so it presents problems for people who need to get up to use the lavatory, or speak with the flight attendant, or simply pass trash to the aisles.  Phone users will also miss most announcements.  

People now have an expectation that you cannot make calls during flights, so the rest of the population understands and works around these short hours.  A few hours without media is actually a good thing.

This is going to create so many conflicts.  Please continue the ban on in-flight calls.

First of all, it raises serious concerns for me that cell phone usage will interfere with the pilot's ability to communicate with those on the ground.  For someone who already struggles with the fear of flying, this will only work to enhance that fear. 

Secondly, there is nothing more annoying than having to listen to someone in a seat right next to you talking on their phone.  Headphones/ear plugs are not strong enough to drown out the loud conversations people tend to have on their phones.  With the white noise that already exists on an airplane, people will talk loudly, of this I have no doubt.  Please don't put us through this.  If someone has an important enough issue that they must make a call, let them use the phones already in place on the airplane and pay the high fee for usage.  But to give all publics access to making calls on their cell phones will merely create havoc and irritation in an area where fear, frustration, and impatience is already unusually high.

Thank you for allowing me to comment on this important issue.  Again, I beg you to reach a decision that does not allow cell phone usage on airplanes by the general public.

Consider the train analogy.  I regularly commute to work by train, and it is abundantly clear that on trains, the use of cell phones is disruptive and annoying to everyone (except of course the cell phone-using jerk).   I estimate that perhaps 20% of cell phone users on trains are respectful in terms of their voice volume.  The other 80% cause everyone around them discomfort and displeasure, and occasionally cause unpleasant words to be exchanged.  And my train rides are usually only about 45 minutes.  Imagine the extra tension resulting from being stuck next to some chatty jerk for the longer duration typical of airpline flights.

Do we really need to add more reasons for airline passengers to get into fights?

There is also the question of economic fairness: is it fair that a cell-phone talker pays the same ticket price as all the many non-cell-phone-talkers around him, who experience a far lower quality of service (i.e., noise)?

Those who want to communicate while on a plane have the perfectly acceptable, perfectly quiet alternative of texting.  By banning cell phone voice use we do not infringe on their ability to communicate, but we do increase the safety and comfort of the travelling public.",,,,,,,

Allowing phone calls to take place in a public environment is not an unfair business practice. Individuals have no more right to avoid the sound of the human voice than they to do have silence. 

The DOT should not try to regulate whether or not phone calls can be use on flights -- they should allow airlines to decide for themselves. The market will shift depending on whether or not an airline allows in-flight calls: Some airlines will pander to business flights and allow the calls, and other airlines that target families will disallow them. 

While the DOT does has statutory authority to regulate fair business practices, it does NOT have authority to make subjective judgment calls as to whether or not a certain practice will be annoying and outlaw it on that basis. The DOT should not take a ""passenger inconvenience"" and declare it an unfair business practice. If anyone can point to tangible financial or physical effects of allowing phone calls in flight I would love to hear them.

I am not interested in being subjected to my seatmate's conversations for two minutes, let alone for the duration of a cross-country flight.

I have no scientific backing for this, but it has been my experience that the more inane the conversation is, the louder it gets. It's not a matter of people knowing how to use their ""indoor voice"": Even that is too loud when it is only a foot away. And if two adjacent people are involved in verbal cell communications, they will certainly escalate their voices because they can't hear themselves. I am a musician and have seen this phenomenon play out on stage where a guitarist will turn up his amplifier if he can't hear what he's playing, not thinking in the least about how that will affect the onstage sound, or that it might lead to others raising their volume.

I can't think of any emergency that is so dire that its resolution can't wait until the passenger has landed. If a person's input is so important, they perhaps they shouldn't be flying. We're getting by just fine without this: Please don't make an already bad situation worse.

Thank you for providing this opportunity to express an opinion regarding cell phone usage aboard operating, in-flight aircraft.

I am advising ""no"" on the use of cell phones in flight. Most people talk louder and longer than necessary while using cell phones in public areas,  The background ""white"" noise level in a plane is already quite high, so people on phones will be even louder than they are in other public spaces. Importantly, many of us on planes are either flying for business and therefore are working (preparing for meetings, etc.), or we are enjoying a few rare hours of peace and relaxation, or we are using the time to be alone with our thoughts. Folks on cell phones will make these situations impossible. Please do not allow cell phones on planes.

I have flown more than 1 million miles and am concerned that cell phone calls will disturb everyone near the caller.  Yet, the caller did not pay for my seat and he or she should not be able to disturb me at will. 

Frankly, even at the gate, so many phone calls in a much less confined space is very annoying, but at least I can leave my seat at the gate and move.  Once I am on the plane, I am trapped and cannot move away from someone's personal phone call noise.

Designation of quiet zones would be physically difficult and would probably create another class of service, with freedom of annoyance becoming an ""upgrade"" as aisle seats have now become.

This response to the Use of Mobile Wireless Devices for Voice Calls on Aircraft ANPRM represents the interest of the Ohio State University’s international student who is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree with a major in Aviation Management. The Ohio State University is one of the most well known Universities with outstanding aviation studies and has its own airport that is widely used as a GA reliever airport. Even though I am not a citizen of the US, I do qualify to participate and respond to this ANPRM since I am concerned with this rule making process and am a consumer of US and international passenger flights. Conventional wisdom says that marketplace competition is the most effective regulator of economic activity; however, there is a question as to why there are so many aviation regulations and safety recommendations. It is the FAA’s responsibility to assign, maintain, and enhance safety as its highest priority. Everyone should realize that safety is the most important factor, not competition over factors such as service options which include allowing using wireless devices while airborne. Whether or not to allow wireless devices for voice calls on aircraft is a highly controversial subject. Some people are asking the question whether using electronic devices is really dangerous or not. David Carson, an engineer with Boeing, said “It’s good news and bad news thing. Electronic devices do not cause problems in every case. And that’s good. But it’s bad in that people assume it never will” (spectrum IEEE). If anyone could predict when and how an accident will occur, there would be no accidents at all. Thus, allowing the use of mobile wireless devices for voice calls on aircraft should be banned for not only for the safety issues, but also for the passenger’s convenience.

Summary of Response: SaeMin Kim, an international student at the Ohio State University 

•	If the rule allows passengers to use mobile wireless devices for voice calls on board, this would have negative effects not only on safety issues, but also on passenger experience which may, overtime, reduce the profitability of the entire US commercial airline system. 
•	However, there should be an exemption on using mobile wireless devices for voice calls on board for emergencies, such as medical treatments, maintenance, and weather issues.
•	Also aircraft with operating certification of FAR Part 91K or 135, such as private jets, fractional ownership, charter flights, and non-common carriage, should be exempted from banning the use of mobile wireless devices on board. 

The remainder of this response directly addresses particular questions posed within the NPRM

In response to ANPRM Question 4: 

There should be exceptions on banning in-flight voice communications on mobile wireless devices for charter flights, air taxi, or fractional jets which are operated by private companies. Since each of the passengers owns the part of aircraft, each passenger should have authority to use in-flight communication devices and; thus, each passenger has the responsibility to use communication devices properly without interfering with the operation of the aircraft or the other 
passengers. 

In response to ANPRM Question 9: 

Business travelers in particular often need to perform job-related work while in-flight. Having a noisy traveler in the adjacent seat would negatively impact their productivity and may cause them to select alternative mode of transportation next opportunity. This would be similar to having to sit next to a crying baby. The difference is while we can’t ban babies; mobile devices can be banned or restricted. 

In response to ANPRM Question 12: 

Nothing would be more stressful and disruptive than listening to people talking on the phone for hours while on long-haul trips. The in flight experience of very few passengers will be enhanced by being subjected to hours of listening to their neighbor drone on about the inconsequential details of their day. In fact, most passengers would find such an experience very un-enjoyable. This in turn may cause some passengers to decide against flying the next time they need to travel. This decrease in passenger traffic would negatively impact the profitability of airlines which allow the use of in-flight mobile devices. 

Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to comment on this ANPRM.  I hope you find my comments helpful making this important decision concerning safety and the passenger experience.

Passengers are often cranky enough with the everyday irritations of plane travel.  This seems like a ""time bomb"" likely to ignite verbal abuse at the very least and possibly worse.  Just another set of issues that the flight crew might have to deal with.  I'm a friendly person who usually engages in brief, casual greetings with seatmates while we're all settling in.  Then when we take off, I usually read a book. I, for one, would probably go the passive-aggressive route if voice calls were allowed during flights.

Everywhere we go we are confronted with strangers talking loudly on cell phones.  Airline travel is tedious enough without being a captive audience to someone who relieves his boredom by talking relentlessly for an extended period of time. I don't want to listen to someone arguing with a service provider, complaining about aches and ills, reporting on their latest family crisis or gossiping about the trivia of their lives.

Even if voice phone calls do not present a danger to air travel, they certainly would have a negative impact on fliers. I assume it also would add to the stress of airline attendants who would be called upon to mediate when they receive complaints about chatterboxes who are oblivious to the effects their one-sided conversations have on others.

Please don't allow voice phone calls on airplanes! If people want to text or play Angry Birds, at least they can do it without bothering those around them.

If I have a choice of flying on a plane that allows voice phone calls or one that prohibits them, I will chose the provider that prohibits them.

Unlimited use of cell phones is not bearable.  People shout if they are calling a long distance (yes, still ...).  And they should when there is background noise, even though their listener is somewhat unaffected by the background noise.

There are, however, periods of time when there is much ambient noise and activity in the cabin anyway, such as the first 15 minutes after take-off, and the last fifteen minutes before landing.  

Limiting calls in the cabin to that period would permit some reasonable amount of telephonic communication without disrupting what little peace passengers may get.  ",,,,,,,

The seats place us far too close together for anything resembling privacy, cell phones have such weak feedback that people do not realize how loud they are speaking, and the interior shape lacks any sound baffling.  This rises to the same level of irritation and distraction as a crying baby.

I do not want to be forced to listen to medical issues, HR problems in the office, strategies for selling a reluctant custormer, intimate details of romantic relationships and other conversational content to which I should not be privy.

My view of the current proposed regulations on cell phone use can be summarized as follows:  

I think that everything that is not likely to be significantly disruptive (using your laptop, watching movies or listening to things with earphones, texting, etc.) should be permitted. However talking (or listening to conversation from others not present in a way that can be overheard by other uninvolved passengers) on VOIP or cell phones or any other device, if done for a long time by anyone, will likely be quite disruptive to those passengers who are not a part of the conversations. Therefore, such communications should not be allowed, except on an emergency basis (as determined by the flight attendants) or for short periods like taxiing after landing (where it can help people deal effectively with their arrival needs, is understood to have limited duration, occurs when there is already disruption, etc.).

Specifically my response to the questions from the website are:

1. I BELIEVE IT IS UNFAIR TO OTHER PASSENGERS TO BE DISTURBED FOR POTENTIALLY LONG PERIODS OF TIME BY CONVERSATIONS WHICH THEY CANNOT AVOID.  THIS IS SIMILAR TO BEING HELD FOR LONG TIMES ON THE TARMAC, OR FOR BEING EXPOSED TO SMOKE FROM OTHER PASSENGERS' CONSUMPTION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

2. THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD NOT COMPLETELY REMOVE ITSELF FROM RULEMAKING ON THIS SUBJECT.  IT MAY CHOOSE TO ALLOW AIRLINES TO EXPERIMENT WITH ALLOWING VOICE COMMUNICATIONS, BUT IT SHOULD REQUIRE THE AIRLINES TO CONFINE THOSE WHO INTEND TO DO SO TO A SECTION OF THE PLANE SEPARATED FROM THE ""NORMAL"" SECTIONS WHERE IT IS FORBIDDEN, AND THE SECTION IN WHICH IT IS PERMITTED SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO INTRUDE ON THE SECTION WHERE IT IS FORBIDDEN-- THAT IS THE ""VOICE-COMM"" SECTIONS SHOULD BE SHRUNK AS MUCH AS NEEDED TO ALLOW THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO SIT IN THAT SECTION. 

3.  ANY IN-FLIGHT VOICE COMMUNICATIONS TO/FROM OTHERS NOT WITHIN EARSHOT AND WHICH CAN BE OVERHEARD BY OTHER PASSENGERS SHOULD BE BANNED, EXCEPT FOR EMERGENCIES AND FOR THOSE LIMITED PERIODS WHICH ARE CLEARLY INTENDED TO BE OF SHORT DURATION (SUCH AS THE TAXIING PERIODS AT THE END OF THE FLIGHT)

4. IF PASSENGERS HAVE ALTERNATIVES THAT DO ALLOW A BAN, THE FLIGHT IS ADVERTISED TO ALLOW VOICE COMMUNICATION AND AGREED TO BY ALL PASSENGERS, THEN THERE SHOULD BE NO BAN.

5. THE NON-EMERGENCY USE OF ANY DEVICE IN A MODE WHICH INVOLVES FREQUENT, REPEATED, AND/OR LONG-DURATION CONVERSATIONS WITH ANYONE NOT LOCATED WITHIN EARSHOT OF THE SPEAKING PARTY SHOULD BE BANNED.  I SEE NO NEED FOR ANY FURTHER DEFINITION, AND FURTHER DEFINITION INVITES ""GAMING"" THE REGULATION.  

6. TEXT-TO-SPEECH TECHNOLOGY WHOSE USE RESULTS IN NEARBY UNINVOLVED PASSENGERS OVERHEARING THE CONVERSATION SHOULD BE BANNED (WITH THE EXCEPTIONS NOTED ABOVE).  USE WHICH CANNOT BE OVERHEARD SHOULD BE PERMITTED.

7. SHORT DURATION USE AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE FLIGHT IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT INCONVENIENCE TO PASSENGERS, AND MAY HAVE CONSIDERABLE VALUE TO A WIDE RANGE OF PASSENGERS NEEDING TO INITIATE OR TERMINATE VARIOUS ACTIVITIES CONNECTED WITH THEIR TRAVEL.  EXACTLY WHEN THESE PERIODS SHOULD STOP AND START IS NOT TOO CRITICAL, AS LONG AS THEY DON'T INTERFERE WITH THE FLIGHT CREW'S NECESSARY ACTIVITIES.

8. 

a. YES AS INDICATED IN MY EARLIER RESPONSES.

b. THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD EXEMPT THESE INDIVIDUALS, AS LONG AS THE USE BY THESE PEOPLE IS REASONABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR PURPOSE FOR BEING ON THE AIRCRAFT.

9. HARMFUL-- POSSIBLE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL DISCOMFORT OR HARM TO MANY PASSENGERS DUE TO INESCAPABLE NOISE AND DISRUPTION.  BENEFICIAL-- POSSIBLE ABILITY OF SOME PASSENGERS TO TRANSACT USEFUL BUSINESS OR DEAL WITH PERSONAL MATTERS.

10. THIS COULD BE A WAY FOR AIR-LINE COMPANIES TO EVALUATE THE MERITS WITHOUT A FULL OR PERMANENT COMMITMENT.  THERE SHOULD BE A FEW-ROW SEPARATION BETWEEN VOICE-COM AND NON VOICE-COM SECTIONS.  PERHAPS A PREMIUM COULD BE CHARGED FOR VOICE=COM AND A DISCOUNT OFFERED FOR THOSE IN THE BUFFER ROWS WHO CANNOT USE VOICE-COM BUT HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THE NOISE OF THOSE NEARBY WHO CAN.  

11. SEE ABOVE SUGGESTIONS ABOUT DISCOUNT BUFFER ZONE.

12.  IN PERSON CONVERSATIONS ARE LIKELY LESS NUMEROUS (AND LIKELY QUIETER) THAN THOSE FROM VOICE-COM AND THUS CAN BE DEALT WITH BY EITHER FLIGHT ATTENDANTS, NEARBY PASSENGERS, OR BOTH. 

13. IF AIRLINES HAD SECTIONS OF SOME FLIGHTS, OR EVEN ENTIRE FLIGHTS, WHERE VOICE-CALLS ARE PERMITTED, THE MARKET COULD THEN DETERMINE THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF ALLOWING VS BANNING.

14. SEE PREVIOUS COMMENT

15.  IT SEEMS THAT THIS MUST BE TRUE.

16.   I HAVE NOT HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THESE FOREIGN CARRIERS.  I SUSPECT THAT DIFFERENT CULTURES OF THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES' PEOPLES (SOME MORE CONSIDERATE THAN OTHERS) MAY PRODUCE DIFFERENT REPORTED VALUE OF VOICE-COM

17.   I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO ADD.",,,,,,,

If cellphone calls are permitted, in addition to the increased conflict and misery for those of us not talking on phones, chances are that more and more people will use earbuds and headphones to drown out the sound, meaning they will be much less able to hear instructions from the flight crew or pilots.

They tend to talk on their phone as if the person on the other end is not able to hear them. That means that I am part of their private conversation whether I like it or not. In an airplane, I am stuck in my seat for 30 minutes before departure until arrival at the destination. A flight can easily be a 6+ hour trip including the time after boarding but before departure.

If an obnoxious person is talking and travelers close by ask them nicely to please quiet down, things may get out of control very quickly. Airline travel is already stressful enough. Adding an annoying person close by who is talking until their battery dies is not something that I think I should have to endure, especially when I may have paid upwards of $500 for my ticket. I and other passengers should have some consideration for the right to have a quiet flight since we paid for it. Screaming kids cannot always be controlled, but no passenger should be able to inflict noise pollution on fellow passengers.

There is nothing so important that a person cannot wait until they arrive at their destination to make a cell call. I also believe that travelers will want to talk at length if calling is allowed.  Almost every airline has phones on the plane for use, but they are there if someone has an emergency that they must respond to immediately.

Please do not allow cell phone calls while in-flight as it is not fair to all the travelers who are NOT talking on a phone.

I oppose the proposed rule change allowing cellular audio communication in flight.
1.  Safety is a significant factor.  Seating in virtually all commercial aircraft is cramped with zero privacy.  From experience we know a significant percentage of passengers using cell phones will be too loud affecting all within hearing.  Most people will endure the rudeness, but a certain significant percentage will confront the user with arguments perhaps escalating to violence.  Expecting the cabin crew to police this in an effective way is unrealistic.  In the worst case, law enforcement upon landing will give passengers no relief during the flight.
2.  Even when a cell phone user attempts moderation in communication, the generally accepted social etiquette of avoiding calls that infringe on other's privacy will break down and again call for others to endure the rudeness, even when it is at low levels.  
3.  How do you write a rule defining what level of volume, vocabulary, conversation subject matter is out of bounds, and leaving the burden on the flight crew to determine and enforce that is not realistic.
4.  With the rule, passengers who observe the rights of others have an excuse for not communicating with others - there's a rule prohibiting it.  Without the rule, conscientious passengers have no excuse and would be forced to conduct business and have other unpleasant conversations even if they didn't want to.

These are the reasons that come to mind.
Please maintain the no cell communication rule or air flight will be unendurable.

Frankly put, air travel nowadays is extremely stressful.  Airlines have managed passenger load levels such that few flights are less than full.  This means passengers in coach are sitting five or six abreast with little room or sense of privacy.  In essence, airline travel nowadays is generally a negative experience where one is more or less forced to sit cheek by jowl with total strangers for extended periods of time.

In such a packed environments it is easy to become annoyed with the behavior of one's fellow passengers whether it's the person nursing a cold and coughing next to you or the child behind who treats your seat back as his ""kicking post"".  Virtually everyone now pulls out a laptop, tablet reader, video game or iPod devise immediately upon being permitted to do so.  While most fellow passengers are generally considerate -- there's always a few who play the volume (even with headphones) at such level as to annoy those around them.

Adding the ability to make cell phone calls to this already unpleasant environment will only add further stress and discomfort to the flying experience.  While it may be true that most passengers would be considerate and judicious in their use of cell phones in flight -- it is inevitable that there will many who will make constant calls and speak loudly and insistently to the annoyance of those around them.

Besides being a frequent air traveler, I regular ride commuter rail trains in the New York City metro area.  Doing so, I have seen how it takes only a few inconsiderate passengers to make riding in a packed rush hour train a literal ""hell on wheels"" for those around them.  Indeed, because of this annoyance, Metro North Railroad and other commuter lines have now found it necessary to designate ""quiet cars"" on trains where no cell phone usage is permitted.  This workable solution for them is unavailable to airlines where everyone shares the same ""car"" and there's no way anyone can move away from an annoying passenger to sit somewhere else.

I cannot predict what will happen if cell phone usage is permitted during air flights.  But it is not unfathomable that in a high-stress environment such usage will ultimately, if not regularly, result in passenger-to-passenger disputes that could readily escalate into violent behavior.  Something no one wants to occur on an airplane.",,,,,,,

But I absolutely DETEST the idea of allowing people to make/receive phone calls on airplanes for these reasons:

1)  The flying experience has deteriorated so demonstrably that just getting there is a chore.  I have to practically disrobe at the airport.  I have to pay $25 to check my luggage.  I have to pay an extra $25 to request a window seat.  And the window seat that I do get is so frightfully uncomfortable, narrow and cramped that it would make a yogi blush.  Adding the possibility of a person near me mindlessly yapping away on the phone may just cause me to stop flying all together.  Furthermore, I can just see every airline charging us non-talkers an extra fee for the ""privilege"" of flying in a space where ""talkers"" aren't allowed.  Great!  An extra fee!  Because we don't pay enough fees.

2)  Airplane flight tends to bring out the worst in people because they are afraid; talking on the phone will be used as a psychological stress reliever.  But one person's stress relief is another person's stress inducer.  I actually enjoy flying - in spite of all the inconveniences.  I enjoy the crowded solitude of sitting quietly while travelling at 500 miles/hour.  Sometimes I watch a movie.  Usually I just listen to my iPod.  Then I fall asleep.  Cell phone talking would absolutely destroy any sense of peace, quiet and decorum many nervous - and non-nervous - flyers try to receive while floating 30,000 feet above the ground.

3)  VERY IMPORTANT:  PEOPLE ARE RUDE!  I take public transportation to work every day and it never ceases to amaze me how many people will talk - LOUDLY - for the entire 45-minute bus ride.  What are they talking about?  That girl who said that, that boy that I don't like anymore, something in Spanish, something in Portuguese, that (bad word) who owes them money, that unpaid bill, the rent, the job, the boss, etc., etc.  Now just imagine these (loud) conversations taking place 30,000 feet in the air, at midnight, on a trans-Atlantic flight.  It could cause violence.

4)  Finally, there are other options available that will achieve the same means.  Allowing people to send text messages achieves the same end result (current time conversing) without aggravating their fellow travellers.  Allowing unlimited texting is the perfect compromise between the talkers and the sleepers.

Please don't allow people to talk on cell phones on planes.  I'm under enough stress already!  I just can't take anymore.",,,,,,,

I am a captain for a major U. S. airline and fly international routes.  I also commute over 2500 miles from my residence to my work place on airplanes.  I travel on airplanes A LOT, and often use that time to catch up on much-needed sleep and computer work. I would not want to be on an aircraft with 150+ people on their cell phones each time I fly.  The noise level would have great impact!

As a safety point, it would become another in the long list of regulatory rules that flight crews are required to enforce.  People have become so attached to their cell phones, distracted by their use, and so disrespectful of authority, that trying to enforce yet another rule will put additional stress on flight crews that already have many tasks and responsibilities to accomplish during a flight.  During the safety briefing, for instance, flight attendants would be required to enforce passengers to hang up their calls while the briefing is being given, or be drowned out by the noise of people making personal calls.  As it is, most passengers do not pay attention to the briefing as they are already using their portable electronic devices (PED) while the safety briefing is being performed!  I cannot fathom how also being on a voice call is going to help that situation!  Factor in an emergency situation, and passengers will now be on the phone instead of paying attention to the flight crews' instructions.   

I fully support the use of SILENT communications such as wi-fi for the use of internet email, text messaging, etc.   
I emphatically DO NOT support the use of voice calls during flight.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this subject. 

Sincerely, 

Captain Suzanne Skeeters",,,,,,,

It is already a problem in other enviroments (like waiting room at the doctor's office) where despide the displayed signs requesting to not make calls,or keep it low......everyone is for themselves and must have that ""important call"".

But I also feel that there are safety concerns to consider.

Persons who are chatting on their telephones will fail to hear announcements on board. For example, if the captain warns passengers to fasten their seatbelts due to approaching turbulence, people engrossed in phone conversations will not hear the warning.

In-flight entertainment (movies and music) pause and become silent when there is an announcement on board, to ensure that everyone will hear the announcement. But if cell phone calls are allowed, I don't believe there is any way to silence those phone calls to make sure passengers hear important announcements.

The other safety issue comes from the inevitable disagreements between passengers, when loud conversations are upsetting people sitting nearby. This could lead to more fights between passengers, and could also distract stewards and stewardesses from their jobs as they have to spend their time managing disagreements between passengers.

Please ban voice calls on board aircraft. Flights will be safer and more pleasant.",,,,,,,

In an enclosed environment where people are seated so closely together it is quite disruptive if a party next to you, or seated behind you is constantly on the phone, voices carry quite far in this environment and you can hear people from several rows ahead and behind. Especially during evening flights where there is a quiet environment, lights are dimmed so passengers could rest, if passengers were given the option they could be able to talk while others are resting, and no one would be able to monitor or advise passengers to lower their voices because this would be allowed. Another scenerio would be  a business passenger conducting business on their cell phone for the entire flight, and you are sitting next to them. So many times we hear infants crying and passengers complain, imagine someone talking in a loud voice the entire flight This would possible lead to altercations, and be a burden to flight crew where safety is the utmost concern for passengers by crew members. .

The personal space is non-existent, cell phone talkers are invariably loud and long-winded, and they tend to ignore everything going on around them while on a call. This would mean the end of being able to either work quietly on a laptop in one's seat, or being able to read a book, or being able to sleep, all of which passengers tend to need or depend upon when frequently flying.  An airplane ride is often the only chance one has in a busy schedule to decompress, having a bit of down time between events, before having to get back into the fray. Sitting next to someone who just feels like conversing and goes on and on, loudly and rudely, will NOT help anyone. Isn't it bad enough that the width of each seat is shrinking all the time, there is often an issue with bumping elbows with the person next to you (see lack of personal space), leg room is often quite minimal, esp. for tall people (even for me, and I'm short), and the hassle of flight attendants' refreshment service (can't get up while they're in the aisle, can't get around the cart, and the attendants are harried), all of which contribute to 'air rage' and irritation in passengers paying high prices for tickets. Now the FAA is considering ADDING to the number of air travel irritations (don't get me started on oversized ""carry on"" bags that people force into overhead bins, let alone the fees for bags!) by allowing cell phone chatter???  Surely they are KIDDING. PLEASE do NOT recommend that cell phone calls be allowed. Give us one damned break, PLEASE.",,,,,,,

It's too cramped already and will too hard to tune out half a conversation.  

Don't know if you know the science behind why hearing half a conversation is more annoying.  It's not just white noise/ chatter.  It's on-and-off noise, which is MORE distracting than a whole conversation.   

http://www.medicaldaily.com/overheard-cell-phone-conversations-are-annoying-says-science-244621  

From the article:

""Overheard cell phone calls are unavoidable, as much as you might like to tune them out. A new study confirms what you already knew - that overheard phone conversations are much more distracting than normal background chatter.

Because you can only hear one side of an overheard cell phone conversation, your attention is more easily drawn towards understanding it than it would be to a two-sided conversation - even, or especially, if you're trying to pay attention to something else.

The study was published in the journal PLOS One on March 13, by Veronica Galván and colleagues from the University of San Diego.

The researchers asked participants to complete a cognitive task that had them solve anagrams. As they performed the tasks, actors in the background staged a conversation in the background about shopping for furniture, planning a birthday party, or meeting a date at the mall.

Half of the participants only overheard one side of a cell phone conversation, and the rest overheard a conversation between two people in the same room. None of the participants were told that the real purpose of the study was to see how easily distracted they were from their tasks.

""This is the first study to use a realistic situation to show that overhearing a cell phone conversation is a uniquely intrusive and memorable event,"" said Galván in a statement.

""We were interested in studying this topic since cell phone conversations are so pervasive and could impact bystanders to those conversations at work and in other settings of everyday life.""

The participants who overheard the cell phone conversation found it much more distracting than those in the other group. They also remembered more of the content of the cell phone call, and more easily recognized which words were part of the phone call.

The researchers suggest that this effect can be explained by the extra attention resources a person needs to understand a one-sided conversation.

Hearing both sides of a conversation makes it easier to understand, and thus less distracting. When you only hear one side of an overheard phone conversation, you're more likely to devote brainpower to imagining the other side- even if you would rather not.

""Not knowing where the conversation is heading is what makes cell phone calls more distracting"", said Rosa Vessal, a co-author on the study.

Galván also suggests that since people tend to reveal personal information on cell phone calls, even in a public setting, it's especially difficult to ignore and more tempting to eavesdrop.

As a member of the traveling public, I believe the in-flight experience will be negatively impacted by allowing passengers to be able to verbally communicate on mobile wireless devices.  

Airplane cabins are a very intimate space and very often crowded.  Aircraft engine noise permeates the cabin.  Voice conversation noise on cell phones are elevated even in a quiet setting;  it will be even louder as the cell phone user will think they have to raise their voice to be heard over the phone.  Disruption of the passengers around the phone user will be inevitable, possibly leading to irritation, heightened tensions which could lead to air rage.  As well, passenger safety could be affected if phone conversation noise volume drowns out PA announcements by cabin crew.

Flight attendants will have to compete with phone conversations, which will compromise cabin safety in an emergency at worst or they will have to contend with irritated passengers on both sides of the issue which will impact the performance of their duties.

Technology is so advanced that there is really no need for voice conversations;  texting, emailing, or use of social media sites on the web are forms of communication that will not negatively impede on the peace of fellow passengers.  Banning voice calls in the aircraft cabin once the airplane doors are closed does not prohibit a passenger with a vital need to communicate from doing so as there are other technological alternatives;  banning voice calls in flight will, however, preserve cabin comfort and safety.

I urge the Department of Transportation to NOT lift the ban on use of mobile devices for in-flight voice calls.",,,,,,,

1) The crowded space and close proximity of the passengers would make this practice completely miserable for those who want to rest, read or simply prefer a quiet moment, being forced to listen to a loud voice calls from fellow passengers.  
2) It will also make restroom use out of whack if some passengers choose to stay in the restroom to complete their potentially loud and long voice calls with the good intention not to disturb others.
3) It will also make flight attendants' job difficulty when they're called upon to resolve the dispute between callers and disgruntled fellow passengers.

This practice may be allowed, however, if the call is extreme expensive so passengers will most likely only make short calls during emergency situations. This is the situation today as many airplanes offer voice call capabilities using phones from the back of the seats.

Nowadays, the mobile technology has allowed everyone to be connected all the times and everywhere and it's hard to find quietness in public places.  On airplanes, more and more airlines may enable Wi-Fi connection so people can go online during their flight, and therefore, VoIP calls are technically possible on some airplanes today.

If people want to communicate by e-mail or text then fine but trying to communicate by voice over a bad connection sitting in close proximity to 20 other people is going to be a source of annoyance to many. Currently we are allowed to use cellphones for voice calls while taxi-ing and this is fine as you know it's only going to be a brief call.

This requires between two and four flights each week.  While I might occasionally find it personally convenient to make phone calls during the time I am on the plane, I am totally against this proposal to loosen the regulations.
It has been my experience over several years that more often than not, people making calls are either unaware or do not care that they speak in very loud voices.  In fact, in some cases if they spoke a little louder they wouldn't need their phones at all,.... their intended audience would be able to hear them no matter what the distance would be.

I am often engaged in work during my flight that involves either reading or word processing.  To be exposed to some else's overly loud conversation would be distracting to say the least.  If the conversation was to be especially long and/or loud it would prove to be annoying.

In restaurants and other public places I have approached very loud conversants to politely ask that they lower their voice.  Most of the time I am met with hostility as people seem to regard their constitutionally protected right to free speech to include the freedom to distract, annoy and irritate others.

I am afraid that on flight phone usage would lead to many confrontations as people argue this point.  Thank you",,,,,,,

Please don't approve the use of mobile phones on planes, or at least require passengers to sit in a ""phone zone"" like there used to be for smokers.

in answer to the inevitable argument that businesspeople will be able to make more money if they can make phone calls on planes, here's a money-making opportunity for airlines: In Britain they have Quiet Cars on trains for those of us who don't want to listen to others' phone calls.  Consider something like on planes.  I would pay extra to sit there.  ",,,,,,,

A device that was designed primarily for emergencies and short-term convenience has become a mouthpiece for an increasing number of boorish louts who have nothing better to do than to air their personal business (usually at top volume) in the presence of other people.  I have observed this phenomenon with both interest and annoyance.  Why anyone would want to share his or her private business with total strangers is beyond me, but I'm becoming increasingly convinced that this behavior springs from feelings of inadequacy and insecurity along with arrogance and entitlement.  In an increasingly impersonal and technology-driven society, many people feel alienated and powerless.  So they try to find ways to feel less disconnected and more powerful.  And in a society which no longer observes (much less values) the practice of common courtesy, people have increasingly engaged in self-serving and arrogant behaviors.  It is at this point that laws need to be enacted in order to discourage (and hopefully) stop such behaviors.  Most people (even those who use cell phones in public places) respond to consequences.  Requests (verbal or written) are usually inadequate; a fine, however, is simple, clear, and easy to enforce.  It would be an effective solution to an increasingly out-of-hand problem.      ",,,,,,,

First of all, what could possibly be happening that you need to have a voice conversation instead of just texting or e-mailing it? YOU'RE IN A TUBE 35,000 FEET IN THE AIR! WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY DO ABOUT IT??

Secondly, it's already cramped and loud in the cabin. Even if only 10% of the people actually use the phones during flight, that's 15-20 people (on a domestic flight) all trying to talk over engine noise, ambient noise, and now, 19 other jerks trying to do the same thing. And just imagine someone with a baby who has been having a difficult time with the flight, and after an hour of crying the baby finally settles down and falls asleep. Five minutes later some fool's phone starts playing the theme from The A-Team and wakes up the baby just so this guy can complain about his dry-cleaning bill from last week. Does anybody deserve that kind of punishment?

Finally, there are some unintended consequences. For example, when someone receives a number of phone calls in a short period of time, the recipient or those around them can commonly be heard to remark that their ""phone is blowing up."" Someone hearing that statement without the appropriate context could misinterpret the statement to mean something much more sinister, creating a major disturbance in flight. Imagine also the possibility of someone casually remarking as they board the plane ""oh, I just know that as soon as we get in the air my phone is just going to start blowing up."" Suddenly an innocent turn of phrase that this person has used probably 10 times that week has now made her guilty of a federal crime. 

Stop the insanity and ban voice calls on airplanes, and impose stiff penalties on those who would choose to ignore these rules. For example, have flight attendants warn passengers who try to make or receive calls ONE TIME. If they try it again, the attendant should be empowered to confiscate the device, through the rules the passengers agreed to upon purchasing their tickets. If a passenger refuses to turn over the device, the Air Marshall (or co-pilot if no marshall is aboard) should have the authority to physically remove the device from the passenger's possession and sequester him or her for the remainder of the flight, pending some kind of fines or other actions upon landing. If the passenger becomes combative, their actions would already fall under existing rules.",,,,,,,

As a frequent (economy class) business traveler I urge that mobile phone conversations not be allowed on aircraft.  It would add further discomfort to already passenger-unfriendly environment, and could easily lead to potentially dangerous conflict between passengers and between passengers and airline staff.  

Airline flights are already noisy and uncomfortable. There is no way for a passenger to leave if a neighbor engages in loud cell phone conversation.  Anyone trying to work, sleep, or must relax is out of luck.  Asking a fellow-passenger to stop risks conflict.  There are also issues for the well-being of children and the elderly.

An obvious option is to complain about a disruptive neighbor to airline staff.  The resulting distractions will add to airline staff workload, distraction and possibly even compromise passenger safety.

In summary, allowing ell phone calls on flights offers little benefit and much harm.  To conclude if Ariline A allows them and Airline B does not, guess which airline I will take.",,,,,,,

I'm writing to ask that you please continue the ban on voice calls using mobile wireless devices on aircraft within, to, and from the United States.

I can see many potential problems with allowing people to use their phones on flights.  First, who would be qualified on a plane to decide if someone is talking too loud (or using inappropriate language among children) and being disruptive to those around them?  I think that places an unnecessary burden on flight attendants who are already stretched to the limit and whose primary concern should be keeping everyone on board safe.

Second, more people will be out of their seats during the flight, either seeking privacy for their call or because they like to pace and talk.  This will only make things more unsafe for all on board.

I think it's great that so many airlines now offer internet access while flights are in the air.  That should be enough.  I don't think very many conversations are so important that they need to be had while in the close company of so many strangers and can't either wait until landing or be conveyed via email.

I honestly don't see any positives with allowing voice calls to take place on flights.  Please keep our skies safe and quiet!",,,,,,,

Please do not expose captive passengers to the annoyance of a few.

Thank you,

Many people just have no clue how rude their behavior is to subject people around them to their loud and tedious conversations. 
Recovering after major surgery a few years ago, the patient with whom I shared the hospital room talked loudly and incessantly for hours on end on the phone (about her cat), making it impossible for me to get much needed rest. It was highly stressful.  As a result, I asked to be discharged the next day even though it was recommended that I stay another day or two for optimal recovery care.  As it turns out, the early discharge created another medical problem that required readmission the day after discharge.  None of this would have happened if I had not been subjected to such a intolerable environment in the first place by the clueless ""roommate"".

Perhaps there could be a designated small place on the plane for limited timed voice phone use (e.g. emergency conversations) but absolutely no way should they be allowed all over the plane.

The only saving grace is that it is pretty much contained to the individual.

If phone conversations are allowed....there could be a cacophany of anywhere from 50 to 200+ passengers speaking and THAT would disturb the other passengers around them as well as aurally blocking out important crew announcements during the various critical segments of the flights.  Passengers irritated by conversations of other passengers could potentially lead to increased altercations between passengers in the cabin that would lead to flights diverting for unplanned landings.

The crux of the matter is that phone conversations could lead to the disturbance of peace for the consumer that has purchased a seat on an aircraft and is subject to the multiple conversations of other passengers.

To allow cell phones on flights would be a terrible ruling.  Please continue to ban the use of cell phone on aircraft.",,,,,,,

I pity flight attendants should such calls be permitted.

On the other hand, calls from flight crew should be permitted if the FCC determines that it is safe in technical terms to do so - there are often times when a quick call can be advantageous in operational terms - but limit this to flight crew only.

Texting while in flight (once again, if the FCC finds that this is technically acceptable) would not be an issue but voice calls certainly would.

My name is Jeri Vargas.  I believe that the policy on Cell Phone use should remain limited.  I understand that data has shown it safe to use cell phones on flights, On the other hand, it is definitely more respectful. People tend to be too loud; someone self-centered about their cell phone use in public.We have all experienced people in stores and restaurants, talking loud enough for everyone to hear; disturbing our own concentration.  By limiting cell phone use to only emailing or texting, it would preserve the modicum of personal space we all try to ""enjoy"" while flying.  As more seats are crammed into the cabin space, and fewer personal graces are valued and practiced by both airline staff and passengers alike, diminishing the opportunity for more stress becomes important to preserving the quality of the experience.  Rude people will continue to be rude, with airplane staff doing their best, but giving such people even more tools to be annoying with, will only make it worse. Please consider any change of policy with forethought: is it REALLY necessary to have more toys to communicate with in the air?  Isn't email access enough?

I worked at a cafe for many years and quickly discovered that people have very different ideas of what they view as considerate/polite cellphone usage.  How many customers asked to move to another table because they could not carry on a conversation due to another customer's loud cellphone use at an adjacent table?  We lost count.  And volume is not the only issue.  The content of conversation is also a problem.  I recently had to move my children to another exhibit at the zoo because of the inappropriate nature of a cellphone conversation next to us.  

The point of these examples is twofold.  One, many people do not know how to regulate the volume or content of their cellphone conversations in the presence of strangers.  And two, the examples above show the need for those bothered by these conversations to move away.  The problem on an airplane is that there is no option to move away.  If you and your children get seated next to a passenger having an inappropriate conversation, you most likely are not going to be able to get up and move.   If the volume of the cellphone user is so loud that you can't sleep, you can't just move to a seat four or five rows back.  

Some may propose having separate cellphone and cellphone-free areas of the aircraft.  This would be similar to when planes had smoking and non-smoking areas.  Sound, like smoke, travels.

I believe that while allowing phone calls on flights may make some happy, in the end, the airlines will end up with far more unhappy customers.  Thank you.",,,,,,,

Subject: Use of Mobile Wireless Devices for Voice Calls on Aircraft

My name is Kristin Williams and I am frequent flyer.  I believe that the DOT should not ban voice calls on flights.

Although many people have expressed concerns over courtesy, this issue could best be handled at the airline level. Once the use of voice calls is approved by the FAA and FCC the DOT’s Office of the Secretary should do the same.  

Considering this agency’s unique interest in consumer experience it may be necessary to take into account the opinions of all the publics that will be affected by this rule. As is indicated in your summary, the Association of Flight Attendants and Delta Air Lines passengers seems to overwhelmingly disagree with the idea of allowing voice calls. This is likely the most convincing reason to ban voice calls. 

That being said, banning voice calls could lead to an absurd end; voice call service would not be possible on any passenger flight in the U.S. Instead, the DOT should allow voice calls and leave the decision of whether to enable mobile communications to individual airlines.  Those airlines that choose to enable the communications through Airborne Access Systems can then choose how to regulate cellphone use during flights. Consumers would then be free to choose between airlines that have stricter regulations on cell phone use or airlines that do not allow their use at all.

Again, the DOT should not adopt a rule banning voice communications on passenger flights. The best way to accomplish this agency’s goal of serving consumers would be allowing the voice calls on flight, and affording consumers the opportunity to choose the airline that best aligns with their needs. 


Respectfully Submitted,

Kristin Williams

The DOT's mission is to serve the United States by ensuring a fast, safe, efficient, accessible, and convenient transportation system that meets our nations interests and enhances the quality of the American people. In order to achieve this, they must ban voice calls on planes to create a safe and peaceful environment. Permitting voice calls in an enclosed cabin space has the potential to drastically alter the publics experience. Representative Bill Shuster said ""Airplane cabins are noisy, crowded and confined. Most passengers would like their flights to go by as quickly and as quietly as possible. Subjectively passengers to potentially multiple phone conversations...

Subject: Comments on Use of Mobile Wireless Devices for Voice Calls on Aircraft, Regulatory Identification Number 2105-AE30 (February 24, 2014), Docket No. DOT-OST-2014-0002-0018.

I am Lindsey Pace, a first-year law student at UC Hastings. I previously lived in Washington DC but am a native Californian. As such, I have been exposed to the irritants of long trips on a plane. I believe that allowing unbridled voice calls on planes would be unfair practice to passengers but I believe that restricted voice calls would be best for both passengers and business. 
The OST derives the power to label practices unfair from 49 U.S.C. 41712 and says that an “unfair practice” is one that creates harm to customers from which they cannot reasonably escape. Although being in the tight quarters on aircraft carrier for a long period of time warrants difficulty in escaping unwanted sounds, a safe zone or earplugs can avoid the nuisance of voice calls for customers. 

By allowing recluse for customers opposed to voice calls, the OST can fascilitate the goals of business and customers. Allowing businesses to offer voice calls on flights limits puts the responsibility in their hands. Businesses and Congress are both responsive to the public. If businesses allow voice calls, angry passengers will force them to enhance or abandon the practice by way of economic impetus. Although the agency is responsible for the unfair practices of businesses, it would be unfair to ban a practice which is otherwise safe and allowable because it could create moderate discomfort.

We fly coach and generally our flights last four hours or more.  The seats on these flights are small and passengers are practically sitting on top of one another.  At times it takes the patience of a saint to deal with the behavior of some passengers who do not show common courtesy in dealing with their fellow passengers.  If airlines began to permit passengers to use wireless devices for voice calls during flights it would exacerbate the intimacy problems that already exist on todays flights.  The thought of someone sitting next to you, no more than 18 inches from your head, speaking on a cell phone is unacceptable.  Suppose you are reading a book.  How could anyone concentrate on reading while a cell phone user is speaking, again only 18 inches from your ear?  In any other environment you could walk away.  That is not an option during a flight.  Even one conversation would be an issue.  Imagine the cacaphony of multiple conversations going on simultaneously within ear shot.

Such an environment would not only result in even more discomfort for passengers, but I could forsee increasing confrontations between passengers and potentially causing physical harm.

I am subjected to this ""crap"" on my commuter rail line all the time.  Fortunately, Metra has designated ""quiet cars,"" but if you don't get to the train early, they are always already filled!  This type of arrangement is  not practical for a plane.

Frankly, if you allow cell phone conversations, you will be allowing people to violate my rights.  Crying children on flights give me a headache, but I understand accept this as a part of life.  However, cell phone conversations are not a ""natural"" part of life.  

I work in a very demanding industry and if I didn't get my calls made before the flight, it's my own fault and I should NOT have the right to subject my fellow passengers to have to listen to my issues.  Don't expect the public to be able to ""police"" themselves, as there is just a percentage of the population that is just plain rude and have no consideration of others.

My experience with people speaking on their cell phones, their voice volume elevates.  It doesn't matter where they are, hotel lobby, airport, car, or else where.  People feel compelled to raise their voice volume to be heard.  Now, place that same individual in a plane seat behind another flyer who is reading, working, or sleeping.

 I feel very strongly that passengers aboard aircraft should not be allowed verbal phone conversations during flight. If this were a benign world, we could all settle and find a comfort zone as we go. So many people use their cell phone nowadays purposely for intrusive reaching out to others. If fact this is so prevalent that I can not even imagine that changing the law is being considered. We become a captive of where we sit in an aircraft. Can you imagine if your seat neighbor decides to intrude upon you indirectly through cell phone use? 
 And then there is always the person who has no social skills and holds a loud, personal cell phone call right next to you. Are you then able to maintain any sense of peace.
 I am a very socially cognizant person and would maybe have to give up future air flights.",,,,,,,

If one person were talking then others around would have to speak even more loudly.  This would result in increased hostility toward other passengers and ultimately to the flight crew.  Things are bad enough nowadays with the general rudeness exhibited by so many flyers.  Two weeks ago I took a total of four flights in a week.   On each, there were passengers seated in the rear that blocked traffic by trying to push ahead and stow their (huge) bags in the bins at the very front of coach.  This is so inconsiderate of nearly everyone else.  I paid extra to sit up front and don't appreciate having to struggle for space for my small tote bag against some oaf who should have checked his big bag, as I did.

I have a friend who works for Delta and know that the employees there are very much against it, as are employees at Sun Country.  With people who work on planes thinking it is a bad idea, that should tell you all you need to know!

Airline travel used to be elegant, comfortable and enjoyable.  In recent years, airline travel has declined to nearly the equivalent of cross-country bus travel.  Unlimited cell phone usage will complete the decline.  Often, I must use the flight time to sleep due to business schedules.  A center seat with two seat-mates on their cell phones will ensure no rest.  If I choose to read, work on business or prepare for a meeting/presentation, cell phone use by nearby passengers use would be highly distracting.  

Anecdotal examples:
1.  Cell phone rage:  On January 14 ,2014A retired policeman murdered a man texting his babysitter at a movie theater in Florida.  We cannot afford the risk that such event might occur on the enclosed space of an aircraft.
2.  In a restaurant, an old man using a cell phone turned to the teen-aged girls at the next table asking them to quiet it down so he could hear his cell phone. Will cell phone use have priority over quiet conversation on the aircraft?-
3.   ""... CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW!""

I recommend that cell phone usage be allowed only under limited conditions:
- before taxiing
- while taxiing after landing
- inflight only for a short period upon announcement of a flight delay or terroristic threat
- while sitting on the tarmac awaiting unloading to call taxi, limousine service, wife, etc.

Please be respectful of the special circumstances of being an airline passenger.  Increasingly flights are booked to capacity.  Seats are on the small side for most average Americans and it's crowded.  Often you actually have to touch someone (arms, shoulders, knees) when sitting in the middle row or in any seat next to a big person.  Having to endure the phone conversation of someone a few inches away from you is untenable - you're trapped and confined the duration of the flight with no control over the behavior of the person next to you, or near you across the isle or in front of or back of an offending cell phone user.  I've unfortunately had to endure listening to conversations (in the waiting area in the terminal) where the user had to discipline an employee on the phone - loud and emotional; I've had to listen to ""thanks for last night"" conversations; honey, what's for dinner; Joe I've got a great product here and you need to buy it""....ad nauseum.  I DO NOT want to hear anything - it's too close, too personal, and I have no ability to just leave.

Also bear in mind, please, that being ""inconvenienced"" for 1 or a couple of hours without being on the cell phone is not an unreasonable burden to bear in the interest of civil society.

Please protect the simple right to fly without going crazy.  Thank you

Subject: 	
Comments on Proposed Use of Mobile Wireless Devices for Voice Calls on Aircraft 
79 Fed. Reg. 36 (February 24, 2014)		
Docket No: DOT-OST-2014-0002, 2014-03684

My name is Ryan Gramacy, and I am a law student at University of California, Hastings, College of the Law. I was recently introduced to the administrative process in my coursework, and this is my first public comment on a rulemaking. Thank you in advance for your consideration.

As a frequent traveler, I am interested in this ANPRM. In principle, I support a prohibition of disruptive PED ‘tele-conversations’ on aircraft, and believe that DOT has statutory authority to regulate such activity under 49 U.S.C. 41712. However, I am concerned that strict regulation—to the extent it will categorically prohibit tele-conversations—is unnecessary, and may foreclose more innovative solutions. Instead, if private airlines are permitted to experiment on this topic, the benefit to consumers has the potential to exceed the peace of mind of a blanket prohibition. My comments pertain specifically to DOT’s authority under 49 U.S.C. 41712 as well as questions (1) and (2) in the ANPRM.

First, I agree with DOT’s interpretation of 49 U.S.C. 41712, and the Department’s capacity to protect consumers from “unfair” practices in air travel. In promulgating the “Tarmac Delay Rule,” DOT was right to consider the harm to passengers that resulted from multiple hours waiting on the tarmac, a situation passengers could not reasonably avoid. By analogy, the potential for noise and disruption that courteous passengers would face if unregulated tele-conversations were permitted would generate a similar sense of anxiety. This is the psychological effect of unpleasant events outside one’s control or predictability—not knowing if one’s neighbor will engage in a cellphone conversation, for how long, and how obnoxious—a result that might not only lead to new ‘air rage,’ but lack of sleep, disruption of productivity, and general discomfort.

Second, in response to questions (1) and (2)  , I believe that regulation is, as yet, unnecessary. DOT notes that international airlines are already restricting conversations for the benefit of their crewmembers, and in response to market research. Given other public comments regarding the prospect of unregulated phone usage, these airlines appear to be making a independent business decisions to regulate tele-conversations. Freedom from regulation leaves open the possibility that other airlines will find niche markets (e.g., businessmen or socialites demanding phone access, or otherwise willing tolerate annoyance therefrom). These airlines may likely inspire a counter-model, reaching customers who want a reliably peaceful flight; or others airlines providing “quiet sections,” or limited tele-conversations in designated booths. My prediction is the latter model will become the norm, and airlines will compete over their innovation, marketing, execution, and ultimately, consumer satisfaction. 

There will always be demand for cellphone use, whether for emergencies, productivity, socializing, etc.. Questions remain, however, as to the extent of this demand, and how private industry will accommodate it. Moreover, the demand will likely depend on factors such as aircraft size, flight path, and hours in flight. As yet, given the relatively little information available on actual use and demand, it is not clear how DOT should proceed, or what form the public harm—if any—will take. DOT would be best to reserve its authority to regulate, and observe the industry models that develop over a trial period. Such restraint will enable DOT to promulgate rules under 49 U.S.C. 41712 which reflect the particular nature of the harms and unfair practices affecting the consumer—that is, if private industry is unwilling or unable remedy these needs independently.  

I hope the Department considers this comment in light of my shared interest in consumer welfare, and in providing the opportunity for innovative market-based solutions. As noted, I believe that DOT has statutory authority to regulate in this sector, and has aptly done so with previous rules. However, reserving this authority for a tailored solution would provide a greater public benefit, and avoid the costs of a preemptive prohibition.  

I appreciate your request for public comment, and I am grateful to have a system that is so transparent and accountable, yet efficient. Thank you again for your consideration.  


Respectfully submitted,
 
Ryan Gramacy

If there was a way to allow texting for those who must communicate, OK. As it is, airlines are just getting connectivity with the internet. We should see how that goes for awhile. It will allow those who must be in communication that avenue. This is still so much in it's infancy, it may resolve those who need to be in-touch with their love ones, or there not so loving ones.
But don't subject everyone else to that. We all experience enough TMO while we stand in line for anything with people who drone on about nothing, with little discretion.

I am often embarrassed, being a member of the human race, at how inconsiderate, rude, and obnoxious people can be. Many people can't figure out that carrying everything that they own onto the plane is wrong, and really bumping (crashing) into everyone as they go down the aisle. They don't realize how disruptive they have been, as they never apologize.

Sometimes, those final 10, then 5, then 1 minute to shut off their phones is already enough. To sit anywhere around those people who love to hear themselves talk, it would be way too disruptive. So please, save us from ourselves. Ever heard the statement, help me I have opened my mouth and I can't shut up!

There are many reasons why travelers look forward to a short, or long flight to chill out. Let's keep what little enjoyment there is left with flying; don't change the no cell phone policy.

Thank you very much.",,,,,,,

These environments are too small and too tense, and phone calls will put some people over the edge.  There is no escaping the individual who is not intentionally loud but too loud just the same.  One cannot just get out of seat and wander the plane to escape the noise.  We already have air rage events and allowing more cell use will add to them.

Flight attendants have enough passenger behaviors to cope with--I can see this as another item the airlines have to train their staff on--airlines have low enough profit margins that this will just add another burden.

It's interesting to watch people who open their phones the second the planes touches down and are on calls (and not retrieving overhead luggage) so they can verify their arrivals with their pick-up people.  I even find this annoying--if everyone paid attention, we could all get off the plane sooner and be in-person with the people that are being contacted on the phone.

Cell phones are allowed on Amtrak (which is much less tense and more spacious than an airplane) and that hasn't turned out well--there is always someone who has to talk too loudly, for too long, or play a loud game.  Sometimes, loudness is not a matter of the user's intentional rudeness but angering just the same.  Amtrak's ""quiet car"" is acceptable for trains with more than one car, but planes don't have separate sections--it's all one!

I love the story of the former Bush NSA director, Gen. Michael Hayden, saying too much on a train--and then this was reported on the nightly news.   http://news.yahoo.com/former-nsa-chief-caught-spilling-secrets-on-amtrak-212959722.html    

We used to let people smoke on planes and that wasn't such a bright idea and we had to reverse that--for physical health reason.  I think I'm old enough to say that if we do allow cell use in flight we will end up having to undo it anyway--but this time for mental health reasons!  Why waste the time?  Mobile use ... No!",,,,,,,

I urge the DOT not to change its rules so as to allow commercial airline passengers to use cell phones or other voice-transmitting devices.  

Traveling as a passenger on a commercial airline flight is already enough of a getting-to-know-you experience.  We are crowded in together in uncomfortably small spaces with uncertain air quality.  Being forced to listen to others' personal or business conversations on mobile phones impinges on our personal space and assaults our autonomy.  It is not dangerous or unhealthy.  It's simply unpleasant.  Very unpleasant.  It is far worse than overhearing face-to-face conversations because all of us, unsure what the other participant(s) in the conversation can or cannot hear, have a hard time modulating our volume when we are talking on cell phones.  In other words, we tend to shout.  I estimate that when two coach passengers are sitting in adjacent seats, their faces are about 18-24 inches apart.  That's way too close to someone I don't know when they are bellowing into their cell phone.

Moreover, there is no need for such oral communications.  Most younger passengers not only accept texting and emailing as adequate substitutes for voice communications, they prefer non-oral communications.  In other words, banning voice communications does not cut passengers off from the rest of the world.  It only requires them to use more modern forms of communicating, like texting.

Finally, I predict that extensive use of cell phones will reduce civility on airplanes and lead to many more altercations among passengers and between passengers and crew.

In my opinion voice calls on an aircraft would not be a good idea. Years ago cell phone usage while flying on a plane was an issue due to wireless communications and problems that can arise out of cellular interference. Although with time, some of these problems can be minimized with more study and developments on how to control issues pertaining to tower interference, it is believed that additional problems will arise. Problems can include costs on developing such programs to block certain usage, deciding on who's usage to block, determining whether blocking is necessary at all, deciding whether technology has improved to where the same problems from in the past are still present today, whether cell usage will affect the passenger; the list can go one for days. I believe that changing rules to allow cell phone usage causes more problems than necessary. In a way it is looking at whether what is being desired outweighs the issues that will arise out of allowing what is desired. If it's going to cost more to allow cell phone usage to no benefit than it is not necessary. Besides, if you say it will be for emergency purposes only, who decides what an emergency is? Furthermore, people tend to speak louder when speaking on cell phones. An airplane is but so large and can accommodate only so many people and their desires. No one really likes to ride a subway, bus, train, or be in any confined area next to someone who has no cell phone etiquette who is talking loudly about something no one cares to hear about. Asking that person to quite down normally causes a disturbance and the last place you want to be confined where people are throwing punches at each other is on an airplane.  Besides the confinement on an airplane itself, restricts you from doing many things that you could normally do on ground transportation. If someone calls you on an airline with an emergency stating that they need you right away, there is nothing you can do (within reason) except wait until you land. For these reasons (I'm sure I can give more), I don't think voice cell phone usage is a good idea for airplanes.",,,,,,,

In the US and throughout the world, many train companies have introduced ""quiet cars"" where telephones, music, and conversations above a low-level are not permitted.  Like the trains, if it were possible to separate a section of plane where those that wanted to talk could do so without disturbing those who do not, then I would have no objection.  

However, as planes are currently configured (and will likely be for the foreseeable future) such a separation is not possible - just as there was no real way to separate smokers from non-smokers, which of course led to the complete no smoking rule on aircraft.  The seating density on planes is higher than on most trains or busses - a single person's phone conversation, even if spoken in a low voice, could easily be overheard by literally dozens of surrounding passengers.  Further, the current state of travel, especially in coach class, with tight seating and competition for limited luggage storage space (even more severe since the implementation by the airlines of checked baggage fees) often leads to impatience, intolerance, and hostility between passengers who otherwise have benign personalities.  I fear that being forced to listen to a fellow passenger's unlimited phone conversations would cause even more distress than that already inherent in plane travel.

After the sometime difficult process of boarding a plane, rather than feeling cut off, I believe many of us look forward to the hours en route as a brief respite from the outside world.  With wifi capability coming to many planes, if a passenger really must communicate with the outside world, e-mail and texting is most certainly a viable, courteous, and silent option.

The use of cell phones (or any other current or future technology) to make voice calls while on commercial flights should be banned.  Use of cell phones (or other current or future technology) to silently send/receive texts or email could be allowed, if in-flight communication is desired.  Even if it is found that the use of a cell phone to make voice calls is not a disruption of the electronics or mechanics of the airplane, it is definitely an unfair disruption of the passenger environment on the aircraft.   ""Given the cramped, close conditions in aircraft and the inability of passengers to avoid"" overhearing other passengers' cell phone conversations, the consumer would be subject to a greatly diminished flight experience.

I know from my own experience that I sometime speak more loudly when on a cell phone, and I can get engaged in the phone conversation to such an extent that I do not realize how I may be impacting others in the area.  I am generally a nice person and if someone points this out to me, I apologize and get off the phone or leave the area.  However, if someone is stuck in the airplane seat in front or back of me with the seat belt light on, they may not be able to signal me to stop and I may not realize that I am being disruptive.  And I can just imagine how disruptive it would be if numerous people on the plane were all talking away on their phones!

I also know from my own experience that some people speaking loudly on their phone, perhaps fighting with their boyfriend, (sometimes even using very coarse language) can get very combative if asked to please be more quiet.  So rather than risk a confrontation, most will just leave the area.  You can walk away in the aisle of the grocery store, but there is nowhere to go in an airplane.  This will just add to the stress in the plane and may lead to confrontations between passengers and/or flight attendants.  This is not the type of flight experience that passengers or crew members should have to endure.  It would be unfair to subject consumers to this!  ",,,,,,,

In grocery stores, department stores, and in restaurants, one can walk away from the annoying chatting. In an airplane, this in not possible; you are stuck. While flying on an airplane, many people take the time to nap, finish a project, write,do crosswords, read, or just relax.

Emotional tension is high enough on flights as it is.  To unnecessarily increase the tension is a hazard to flight safety.  

There are already enough rude passengers who make the experience uncomfortable for flight attendants and the other passengers.  To allow such people the opportunity to talk on cellphones would be a terrible error.

I would rather fly next to a small child who occasionally cries than to sit next to a passenger talking on a cell phone.

Perhaps allowing cell phones in a designated area (e.g., the back of the plane) separated from the rest of the passengers would be acceptable, but that region would need to be separated by a bulk head from the rest of the passengers.

Allowing voice calls would often be significantly annoying to other passengers and an invasion of their space, diminishing their ability to read, work, enjoy personal entertainment (e.g. a movie) or simply rest.  This annoyance will translate into tension between passengers, cabin personnel being asked to handle disputes, and inevitable conflicts -- all things to be avoided in the small and safety-relevant confines of an aircraft. 

The above situation exists, of course, in many public settings.  However, an aircraft is different in that effected passengers cannot leave the aircraft nor is it typically possible for them to even relocate away from the offending caller.  It is also the case that people typically speak more loudly than normal when using mobile phones in public areas due to background noise. This situation will be exacerbated during in-flight calls since background noise levels are relatively high on in-flight aircraft.  Such a situation will result in an unreasonable intrusion to all passengers within earshot of the caller.

Commercial airlines should be prohibited from allowing mobile wireless voice communications during flight. 


NOTE: The above discussion does not apply to the use of non-voice WiFi on aircraft, which will improve the passenger experience for many and not effect those choosing not to use it.",,,,,,,

Commercial aircraft are already very uncomfortable due to reduced seating distances and extremely limited space at one's feet -- because overhead storage is filled up as more people bring luggage aboard to avoid paying for checked luggage. There are no meals, only high carbohydrate snacks and whatever malodorous sandwich or dinner passengers may have purchased to bring onboard. Sulfurous egg smells, garlic, and similar odors fill the confined cabin space. And already the sound of earphones set to high volume are heard by unwilling passengers. I have been seated lately with a number of people who use their cell phones -- against rules but used none the less -- when the aircraft is in proximity to the airfield. The calls are loud and obnoxious and laced with swearing and potty language spoken loudly and sometimes in anger. If mobile phones/voice calls are allowed during the entire flight, I fear that the combination of passenger fatigue, malodorous food odors, cramped space, and frustration will boil up and turn into anger and violence when a seatmate or nearby passengers are making voice calls and cursing, swearing in anger, talking loudly to overcome ambient aircraft noise while in flight, sharing personal and intimate details not fit for public sharing; physical fights are going to break out. People will be hurt.  Please DO NOT approve or allow voice calls to be made by electronic devices while aircraft are in flight. ",,,,,,,

I am very much opposed to allowing cell phone conversations on flights.  In flight we are quite effectively 'trapped' in a small place with a lot of people, and it is to everyone's benefit to keep that as calm and quiet an atmosphere as possible.  

The aspect of these conversations that is nearly certain to be to disturbing other passengers is simple human nature - if people have any difficulty hearing the person they are speaking with, they naturally speak louder.  As you add more people in more conversations, the increased volume feeds on itself.  Walk into a busy bar just about anywhere and you'll experience this.  

If an airline felt there was sufficient demand to lose the capacity, I could see the addition of a 'phone booth'; a sound suppressed area where people could take turns making those necessary calls.  Personally I would never pay a premium to be on a flight that included such an amenity, but some may.

If the airlines felt they could manage it, I wouldn't have a problem with 'silent texting' being allowed, but this should not only prohibit voice generated texts, but also use of devices with any tone or click produced when the keys are used.  

I certainly appreciate any efforts to keep our flights calmer and quieter.

I'll relate my last flight experience in support of my position. At the gate some arrogant ""business person"" was talking so loudly on his cell phone I could hear every word over 100 feet away. Then the mobs packed around the gate when the pre-boarding announcement was made (since the airlines don't board by row anymore) so that elderly passengers and those with small children had to fight their way through to get on the plane. When I got on the plane, all the overhead bins were full & they had to check my one bag. 

Once in my seat, packed in like a sardine, the toddler seated behind me started kicking my seat back and his parents did nothing to stop him as I requested. This continued the entire flight from Minneapolis/St. Paul to Orlando. The baby they were traveling with then started to cry and scream. Just after takeoff a man seated two seats away started eating his Subway sandwich with red onions and hot peppers which he brought on board with him. The smell was so overwhelming it made my eyes water.

And now there are proposed rules to allow cell phone use on flights??? How much more miserable can flying be made for those of us who still act civilly when flying? Many people don't act in a civil manner, with respect for others, when flying. Use of cell phones on flights will only exacerbate their bad behavior to the detriment of the rest of the flying public. 

Flight attendants have a right to be concerned about this possible change in policy. I would not hesitate to stop an intrusion on my personal audio space by an adult yakking on a cell phone within earshot of me. As a non-cellphone user on a plane I have rights to some modicum of peace during a flight. The flying public has put up with seats with less legroom, chaotic boarding procedures, first boarders taking up all the overhead space, smelly food people bring on board, screaming babies, kids kicking the back of your seat -- now there is a possibility that cell phone use is added to the mix to make a flight even more intolerable???

NO, NO, NO to cell phone use on airplanes!!! People have a right NOT to be intruded upon by others in a closed space from which they can not escape. Allowance must be made for children but not adults who think they can impose their bad behavior on others without consequence. Isn't that why smoking was banned on airplanes?? Exposing non-cellphone users to those that want to use them is similar -- the smoking ban was due to health reasons, the cell phone ban is due to the discomfort and disruption of fellow passengers enjoyment of a flight. Why should someone have to be subjected to someone's incident talking on the phone?

While the lifting of this ban may be beneficial to certain passengers, it would be a huge inconvenience to other passengers aboard. Imagine if the ban was lifted and during a 12 hour flight someone decided to talk the whole time? What if this person decided to use their speaker phone feature to have this conversation? It would also be a huge disturbance if the person using their cell phone is unable to do so with grace; thus talking loudly, even cursing. Could you imagine listening to someone's entire conversation for hours on end? In addition, there is no way that a person (i.e. flight attendant) can regulate the manner in which a passenger may talk on their cell phone. The first thing a passenger would say in response to a complaint is that their First Amendment allows them freedom of speech. When I think of flying; I think of a peaceful experience where I can relax, take a nap and simply enjoy the peace and quiet aboard. Allowing patrons to use their cell phones to make verbal phone calls during flight will only encourage other bans to be lifted; thus, challenging greatly the calming experience of a flight. 

In the event that my point wasn't clear; please do not lift the cell phone ban. ",,,,,,,

The thought of being trapped in a tube twelve inches from someone else's private conversation is alarming.  We cannot limit what that conversation is about, how long it lasts, or how loud it is.  We cannot avoid eavesdropping on conversations that may be offensive because we would then be subject to 'free speech' rights.  If I'm in a restaurant and the conversation is offensive, I can get up and leave.  Not so in an airplane.     Imagine sitting  within about 5 feet of EIGHT separate conversations (3x3 rows of passengers) for hours!  Imagine trying to get work done, listen to music, or trying to sleep on the plane with so many people all chatting in that confined space? Imagine how loud it could become as each increases their volume to be heard over the din of neighboring conversations.   Add that to the noise of the engines and the volume will be at levels that trigger anxiety, aggression, and auditory overload.  I sincerely believe allowing cell phone calls will also cause passengers to argue and fight with one another when one wants quiet while the other carries on a loud and intrusive conversation. I fly at least 5 or 6 times each year and cringe at the thought of being forced to endure such an overwhelming environment.  Presently, if I want to snooze or work, I merely need to let my seat mate know I'm not ready for conversation; to have his conversation forced on me would be extremely intrusive and aggravating.   PLEASE do not subject us to being trapped right next to several inconsiderate or offensive conversations for hours.   

I do not object to cell conversations once the wheels are on the ground, however, because those calls would naturally be of short duration.    ",,,,,,,

Allowing consumers to use their cell phones in-flight for voice communications is unacceptable. Essentially, we are in an enclosed tube flying for hours (sometimes less). Imagine 200 people talking at the same time into a metal tube. That is what it would like on an airplane. It is unfair to everyone and unsafe because words have a way of affecting even those who are not the subjects of the conversation. Texting and email is fine but the phones should be kept on vibrate. The most important thing to keep in mind is the comfort and peace of mind of every passenger on the flight. 
Personally, I do not see why I would need to be on the phone on an airplane. I'd rather let the pilot, co-pilot, and crew members focus so they can do their best at making the flight as pleasant as possible. After all, once that plane takes off, all i want is to get to my destination. That is not because I am afraid but because that is the reason I'm on the plane in the firs place. If I have to hear 200 people talking out loud on that flight, it would drive make me very upset and I am sure I'm not the only one who feels this way. Many upset passengers could, at the least, cause the airline to lose customers. The worse that could happen is up to the imagination with so many people annoyed and upset. Allowing vocal communications on such a large scale is a health risk, a threat to safety, and a disruption to the consumer.",,,,,,,

The laws that currently exist are outdated due to the improvements made in cellular technology and upgrades to the laws that govern their use are greatly needed and appreciated. However there is two issues I have with the proposed law. Though I believe airlines should be able to decide and declare their own mobile device policies, I believe cell phone calls should remain illegal as well as device use during takeoffs and landings. According to a Quinnipiac University study, American air travelers of varying age groups are 2 to 1 in favor of keeping cell phone calls off of airplanes. Though people wish to be able to communicate with the outside world while in flight, most do not wish to have to put up with loud, obnoxious people chattering on phones throughout a flight.  If communication is necessary, a passenger could simply send a text message or an email.  Also, though it is known that cell phone signals themselves cannot bring down a plane, they can have an effect on the plane's equipment and the pilots. According to a recent experiment performed by Boeing, cell phone and other device signals can have an effect on plane radios.  Though they are normally a non-issue, during key times during a flight, especially takeoff and landing, when a pilot most needs to focus  it is important that nothing interfere with their job. Though the chance is minute and the impact can be small, passengers can sacrifice a few minutes without connection to ensure that their pilot's job is as easy as possible.

The FCC revised its proposal and is wanting to lift the ban of calling people on flights. Although the FCC can lift its ban, the Department of Transportation is ultimately the people that decide whether phone calls can happen on planes or not.  This rule still needs to be banned because it could bother people on the plane that just want peace and quiet.  The last thing that these people that are already trapped in a compact area need is for their own peace and quiet to be ruined.  AFA president Veda Shook said ""As the last line of defense in our nation's aviation system, flight attendants understand the importance of maintaining a calm cabin environment, and passengers agree,"" (CNN.com).  I agree with the Department of Transportation when it come to banning voice calls on airplanes.   I believe that there should be an alternative method that can still allow people on the plane to communicate but without them actually talking on the phone. House Rep. Bill Shuster, (R-Pennsylvania) has a proposal that would ban in-voice calls with people but it would allow text messaging to happen. Text messaging is a better alternative because you are still able to talk to people but you are not disturbing the peace of others around you.  However, voice calls in a plane would not force the airplane companies to install special equipment.  All that airlines would have to do is just okay the proposal and then people can call others on planes.  If the ban is lifted, imagine how many people would go to the restrooms to use their phone because they have ""private conversations"" that they do not want other people to hear.  This could lead to problems and people on the plane becoming agitated that people are only using the restroom to talk on the phone.  I believe if the Department of Transportation bans voice calls and allows people to text or use social media then everyone will be content.

It's bad enough it's on the streets, in the grocery stores, on trains -- I once had to listen to a guy for 40 minutes talk about nothing with an f-bomb thrown in about every third word (with children and parents within earshot) until I was ready to unload on him!  By the grace of God - his cell signal was lost and he was never able to get it back for the rest of the trip!  Divine intervention!! When I fly - I want quiet!  There's not enough of that in this chaotic world.  If you allow cell phone usage, I absolutely believe you will see more in flight rage between passengers!  There's a mindset with travel - even if it's for business - to have whatever flight time there is for regrouping.  It is stressful enough traveling on planes these days -- it's expensive, there are long lines for security, long wait times for delays, cancelled flights - the list goes on and on.  It's not enjoyable anymore.  It's actually surprising when you do have a flight that goes off without a hitch, leaves on time, where the attendants actually seem like they like their job and therefore treat you with some semblance of niceness (this being coach of course).  So, adding cell phone usage would just add to the stress of traveling and if it is a long flight or international - listening to someone drone on and on while you are trying to sleep again would be a big reason for possible violence between passengers.  And I know the airplane staff feel that this is like throwing gas on a raging fire!  They do not want to be in a position where they have to police people.  They already do that.

In addition to being unsafe, cell phones are also a public nuisance. Because they think that the person on the other line cannot here them while talking on the phone, people tend to talk louder on mobile devices.

Allowing text messages on a plane would be a less annoying, and equally effective means on communication on a plane that should be permissible.

I very much opposed the idea of allowing cell phone voice conversation to exist on passenger airlines.     I am an active business traveler.  I spend a lot of time in the domestic passenger air transit system.

Flying has moved over time from be a luxury experience to a cattle car experience.  Passengers are jammed into small  seats where people are sitting shoulder-to-shoulder.   A very unnatural environment of person space being intruded upon.   If you witness passengers on a plane, 90% of them keep to themselves and engage in various quiet activities: reading, sleeping, game playing, movie watching with headsets, etc.   They behave in a manner of not wanting to have their seat neighbor engage them and they do not want to intrude on their neighbor.     Again, it is an unnatural environment of strangers being forced to be shoulder-to-shoulder for hours.

The airlines engage in a lot of efforts to cause the passenger experience to be environmentally comfort.  The temperature is controlled.   Avoiding turbulence.    Smoking is not allowed.  Controlling unruly and inappropriate passengers.

Allowing cell phone voice conversation would create a complete violation of personal space of other neighbor passengers.   Everyone in the immediate area would be forced to have the cell phone user's dialog forced upon them.    Remember, there is always the audible drone of the planes engines.   For a person to have verbal phone conversation, they have to speak loudly which is then an accelerated intrusion. 

Cell phone use does not exist now and people's lives move along just fine.    There is no valid reason for the comfort of other passengers to be diminished by a small set of people that cannot wait a couple hours to have a ""voice"" communication.    Keeping in mind that today that airline passengers can log-on and send e-mails.    The technology exists to allow text conversation.    These are both communication activities that allow immediacy of conversation and  do not infringe on the comfort of others.   Having a voice conversation is not necessary and brings with it too much discomfort.

personal cell phone calls are irritating to listen to on the ground, much less in closed quarters with no escape in the air. i have been forced to witness loud and abusive arguments, lewd ""romantic"" ploys, disciplinary rants, grocery lists, laundry lists, and too much idle chatter by individuals i don't know and disrespectful narcissists i don't care to know. additionally, these conversations are not what any responsible parents would allow their children to hear, given a choice.

As it is, pilots and flight attendants have trouble getting passengers to pay attention during announcements and instructions.  It would only be worse if their clients were on the phone!  

For those of us who are NOT parties to these phone conversations, we would be forced to listen to our co-travelers as they ramble on about Grandpa's prostate operation, or the disturbing medical test results they'd just received, or what that scumbag boyfriend had done NOW, or that cute little handbag they just bought or ... whatever.  

And even for these rude, self-centered, insecure folks who simply cannot live their lives without their phones attached to their ears, how much louder will they need to talk in order to be heard over the cacophony of everyone else who's just like them?

As far as the possible ""solution"" of forbidding cell-phone use at night, please note that for those of us who sometimes travel upwards of 20 hours in a plane to get to our destinations, any given time might be ""night"" for us.

distraction/irritation.  Complaining to the flight crew would open up the possibility of retaliation--either to a crew member
responding to the complaint or to the complainer--on the part of the ""offending"" talking person.

It is difficult enough now when you have a noisy neighbor, but with more people carrying on conversations with people not on the plane (and they would speak more often due to being uncomfortable with seat mates vs not speaking at all) it would be unbearable.  People escape to their cellphones to ignore other people, to avoid contact now whether on public transportation, walking down the street, in public places, etc., and giving them the ability to have a  conversation with someone they know (not on the airplane) during the hours of travel, only promotes this isolation with their surroundings.  IT WOULD BE UNBEARABLE to have a plane full of people able to reach out to people they know or conduct business with versus conversing only with those surrounding them or keeping quiet.  Do not allow cell phone conversations on a flying aircraft.  There is no escape for those who wish to maintain some quiet in their heads.  Our culture is too rude and self-centered to expect them to use commonsense about suitable length, topic, volume, etc.  When the plane lands and conversations start, albeit only a few who are reconnecting with business or travel arrangements, it is clearly an increase in noise in the cabin.  Knowing you are leaving the aircraft shortly is the only calming thought that allows others to ignore the increased noise.  I cannot imagine having that noise level throughout the flight.

Allowing voice calls would constitute an unfair practice to consumers pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 41712 and would be inconsistent with adequate air transportation pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 41702.  Nevertheless, there is an important public interest in allowing free communication on airplanes. To balance these competing interests, we propose that cell phone use be restricted to only allow for text massaging.
First, we acknowledge the “increasing consumer interest in the expanded use of electronic devices on airplanes.”  The public is likely to view such accommodations favorably given the increasing dependence on such devices and their communicative utility. Expanded use will not only provide a welcome distraction but also help ease concerns of both passengers and their loved ones on the ground.
Many Americans, however, are concerned about voice calls on planes. Voice calls violate the consumer interest in having an enjoyable flight experience. Unlike in most other settings, on an airplane irritated passengers cannot move away from someone on their phone; they are confined to their seats. This resulting frustration would only compound the already uncomfortable experience of flying. Many passengers already have a fear of flying, and studies have indicated that aircraft noise can produce high levels of anxiety.   In-flight voice calls would only serve to exacerbate such fears and anxiety.
These concerns are reflected in polling. The Associated Press-GfK found that 48 percent of Americans oppose allowing cellphones to be used for voice calls while flying.  Frequent fliers are even more opposed to their use: 59 percent of Americans who flew once within the past year and 78 percent of Americans who flew at least four times within the past year are opposed to the use of voice calls. 
Moreover, in-flight voice calls may create a safety issue for passengers aside from the avionics-interference issues outside the scope of this comment. Listening to crew instructions can make the difference between life and death.  Talking on the phone while flight attendants give safety instructions could prevent the talker and their neighbors from taking note of vital safety information.
As a compromise, allowing texts would provide consumers with connectivity without disturbing neighbors or raising the same level of safety concerns. Most of the public prefers texting over voice calls anyway. 
If, however, voice calls are allowed, they should be subject to severe restrictions. Calls should not be operational during safety instructions, takeoff, landings, and overnight flights. And when voice calls are permitted, the FAA ought to charge or set fees for their use. The FAA could set fees to price out common use, much like High Occupancy Toll lane fees are priced to limit the number of vehicles in them.  Flight attendants should also have authority to ask a passenger to put their phone away if a passenger is being disruptive.

Hello, 

I know the inflight use of cell phones is a multi-level debate and discussion.  My strong feelings against allowing it are based on very simple reasons.  

Most passengers have either personal tablets, iPods, eReaders and phones.  In the big picture, these people make up the majority of people with headsets in their ears that are NOT listening to the inflight entertainment system.  This means that they already don't hear many PA announcements and they potentially would not hear any inflight emergency announcements in a timely manner. I notice myself that if I'm not looking around and observing what is going on while I listen to my iPod, then I can easily miss an important announcement.  

If we now add the use of voice while inflight, it will be opening up the door to even less attention being paid to your surroundings. People are off in their own worlds and they won't take responsibility for paying attention. In an emergency situation, this means potentially not knowing when to move and reacting much slower.   

Also, I am imagining the sound in the aircraft if only 1 person per row decides to talk on their phone.  It is very distracting, and most of the conversations will be of an unimportant nature.  If cell phones can be used in a true emergency, then I understand.  In an idea scenario, people would be able to discern what is an ""emergency"" and what is not, but unfortunately many people mistakenly think what is going on in their lives is of the utmost urgency.

If text messaging and data usage is safe, then that should be the absolute max communication options allowed during flight.  

Regards, 
Susanne

People are rude enough with the other technologies- i.e. loud headsets for iPods,mp3 devices, gaming etc.  Individuals do not need to be exposed to someone talking on a phone during a flight.  A plane is a captive audience.  If someone is loud it can ruin your flight.  If you could get off the plane, change seats, and free yourself from the noise then it would be a different story.  My right to a peaceful flight is important.  More important than someone's right to blab their personal business in public.  Sometimes when you ask people to decrease their speaking volume, they get mad.  The human race can't help itself from overstimulation.  It's time to turn off the phones and read a good book. 
 Who will police the use of cell phones when someone gets too loud?  You can't put that responsibility of the flight staff.  How will the airlines compensate passengers who are bothered by another on a cell phone?  Just say ""NO"".  People can use their phones before and after their flight.

Currently, with the flight crew permission, passengers may use their phones prior to takeoff and after landing and travelling to the gate.

Most of us passengers are already stuffed into very cramped seating, with episodes of uncomfortable environmental conditions such as fluctuating cabin temperatures and air quality, difficulty moving around the cabin when permitted, crying children in close quarters.  It would be just horrible to add to this with people talking on their phones around you and next to you, plus the risk involved of interpersonal conflicts when any passenger disturbed by a talker politely asks that talker to quiet down and that talker tells the person they can just go to hell because he or she is allowed to talk on the phone.  

Please do not make the public suffer more.  Air travel may be the fastest way to go places, especially long distance, but it is already the most uncomfortable travel experience possible, unless you are rich and can afford to fly First Class.

I know that we are in a communications age; but in this age we cannot see report cards or medical information without approval, why then must we be subjected to other people's personal information (and I must say most of the information that I overhear is inane) without our approval?

I say if people insist on talking on their phone they should walk, take a car, bus, or a train with areas where users can move for cell use.  Not on a plane.

Please do not allow the use of cell phones during flight or on active runways. Passengers are forced to sit in very close spaces with no freedom of movement or escape from the disturbance caused by callers who generally talk far more loudly than normal conversation. Permitting this disturbance will have a negative effect on the vast majority of travelers.

There are people who don't understand that even if you can, it doesn't mean that you should do things like this.  Security should be preventative, not reactive.  

Additionally, with heightened danger alerts and needs for additional security associated with flying since 9/11, most flyers are already under stress; allowing the noise from as many as a full plane's worth of conversations (100? 300?) to be carried on at the same time during a flight would simply exacerbate that stress.

The argument has been made that modern technology is now available and could be used by passengers during flights.  But the idea that technology has been made available (in this case, voice calls on cell phones) is not a sound argument for its implementation on crowded airplanes.  Over the past decades, air travel has devolved from  an often pleasant, roomy way to get to a destination, to an aerial sardine can where most passengers are confined to cattle class(i.e ""coach"" or ""economy"" class); forced to pay for checked baggage, sit in uncomfortable, crowded seats with insufficient leg room; and on some airlines, pay extra for the privilege of sitting in most seats on the airplane.  One of the only ""benefits"" passengers have left is the relative peace and quiet they can expect once an airplane takes flight. From time to time, a passenger's nap, concentration, or relaxation might be disturbed by crying children, or inebriated or quarrelsome passengers; but this is not the norm.  If cell phone conversations were allowed on airplanes in flight, whether passengers chose to engage in voice calls or not,  they would suffer the disturbance of a stressful environment, not as a random occurrence, but as constant and stressful noise pollution, from the time they boarded the plane until they landed.  Being surrounded by any number of phone conversations with no means of escape is not unlike being in the center of people smoking cigarettes with no means of egress:  one suffers the unhealthful effects of stress, noise or air pollution, and inconsiderate fellow passengers.  The likelihood that a closed, crowded, already compromised environment will remain calm with the addition of multiple ongoing phone conversations is unlikely because many air travelers,  already uncomfortable, will now be more likely to lose patience and control. Flight attendants, whose primary job is to keep passengers safe, would likely be distracted when forced to arbitrate in more frequent disputes.  Their focus on safety could be interrupted to the point that it would be easier for someone with criminal intent to act when the crew was preoccupied with quelling such disruptions.It would be unsafe and unfair to consumers and crew members to impose a rule that endangers their health and safety and infringes on the right to quiet, undisturbed travel. 

 These health and safety concerns should override any need for in-air phone conversations, except in emergencies.

1. Safety. Given the fact that Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been missing for over 14 days without trace. The ability to use cell phone in air would allow searches to pin point the location, since the cell phones would provide location information.
The events of 9/11 might have had a different outcome if cell phones were permitted to be used. Flight 93's cockpit voice recorder revealed crew and passengers tried to seize control of the flight after learning through phone calls that flights 1,77 and 175 had crashed into buildings. By allowing cell phone use, would provide one additional level of security.
2. Economic. The airlines would be free to charge a fee for anyone, who would want to use a phone while in air. This taxation of the willing would support lower fares. Airlines should be given the option to either allow or preclude the use of cell phone while airborne. It should be a business decision, not a mandate from the government.

Those business people flying first and business class advocating for being able to use their phones in air are thinking only of themselves.  If they and their business are that important they should hire themselves a private charter.  I'm sure they can find some other productive work tasks to do during a commercial flight.  Or they could stay home and use Skype.  Please DOT, do not allow people to make in the air calls.

The vast majority of travelers obviously do not want to listen to a complete strangers' (or an entire row of strangers) conversation, while sitting so close to that person, that some part of their bodies are touching each other, literally trapping the passenger into the conversation.  The obvious conversations that the public does not want to hear could include screaming domestic squabbles, family arguments, explaining photosynthesis for a school project, rambling business conference calls, phone sex, other callers talking louder than the person talking next to them, gay, lesbian, transgender, heterosexual, christian, islamic, jewish, buddhist, hindu, persons with disabilities, liberal, conservative, independent, homeless, wealthy and corporate bashing. It is a simple statistical fact that out of the almost 1 billion people traveling on commercial airliners this year (globally), a small percentage would not be able to control themselves during a phone conversation.  Just 1% of all these travelers amount to 10 million people.  I find it very conceivable that at least 1% of the human population (over the age of 16) is unable to behave in public and would be capable of such conversations during a commercial flight.

The not so obvious reason is onboard security.  By allowing mobile wireless devices for voice calls, a group of terrorists onboard any airliner could use voice calls to coordinate an attack, or possibly detonate an explosive device.  Why would the DOT make a ruling that has the potential for putting every airliner at risk?   Annoying is one thing, but deadly is 100% unacceptable.

I implore the DOT to use common sense and not allow this rule change.",,,,,,,

With no small portion of the public already viewing modern air travel as a hassle more than an enjoyment, passengers being able to use their phones for voice calls would further diminish the flying experience for the majority of the traveling public, period. With nowhere to relocate away from the phone user as there are in other public spaces or on trains, passengers in the immediate vicinity of the passenger using his/her phone for a voice conversation are forced to listen to the conversation in its entirety. With some passengers already having a complete and utter disregard for their surroundings and fellow passengers, a voice conversation could have the potential to go on for far too long and at a volume that is inappropriate for the environment (i.e. and airplane). I have been in an airplane cabin before where a passenger on the opposite side of the aisle from me carried on a conversation for at least 25 minutes at a louder-than-necessary volume during the entire boarding process, and fellow passengers around me were noticeably annoyed, as was I. I simply cannot fathom having to deal with someone (or multiple people) using their phones during flight, where conversations could stretch on for much longer. I feel that at this point, voice calls could also become somewhat of a danger to passengers flying, as it could lead to heated vocal exchanges between annoyed passengers, or perhaps even the off-chance of someone getting up out of their seat to confront the voice user, turning a minor aggravation into a potentially heated situation that could possibly endanger flight safety for all onboard.

People like me, travel to our home country with our children, every few years. The trip takes about 12000 miles one way, and two to three air planes each way. I also take occasional trips within U.S.A. I really scared of even using any wireless device when the plane is up in the air. Even  when some one says the technology is well advanced, I am getting nervous when the  hackers are getting into every sight they want to. So please be very kind enough, not to allow any kind of cell phone conversations in the plane while the plane is up in the air. Cell phones are very nuisance to the next seat person, and who knows one upset passenger is more than enough to cause a turmoil in the plane, and the result would be disastrous.

It would be horrendous to sit next to, behind or in front of a fellow passenger who is on the 
Phone while in such tight quarters as buckled into a seat on a flight.  Couldn't imagine a worse idea!
When a plane lands, one sees the future of cell phone use on board....awful!

You should ban and/or prevent wireless talking during flights.  Allowing this would allow a huge level of discourtesy and impoliteness . . . beyond anything now happening on board flights.  Too many ""talkers"" are oblivious to what they are imposing on others, especially on or to a person sitting in an adjacent seat . . . with no possible ""escape"" or respite from a thoughtless talker.  I cannot think of another similar situation where the thoughtless talker would be SO CLOSE to an adjacent stranger.  And that ""trapped"" stranger would be stuck with listening to an unwanted conversation - or conversations - for potentially hours and hours.

And I do not believe allowing wireless use only in certain seating zones is any answer.  Too often late passengers get assigned unplanned seating completely outside of their control.

Wireless talking on board airplanes is simply a wrong, even terrible option.  Please DO NOT ALLOW IT!",,,,,,,

Therefore, this gives the consumer various options of choosing an airline of one's liking. A person may think making a phone call is convenient, while others find it disruptive for those around.

Personally, my main concern with allowing anyone to make a phone call is safety for all passengers. I believe if allowing mobile broadband waves to be in use while in flight, there is no immediate harm in the navigational airwaves for the aircraft. My worry is more about what is said on the other line than the actual call being made. Think of a telephone call being made to a passenger on flight an airborne plane, the news from this could be devastating. Whatever the call informs the passenger, she freaks and the mental breakdown brings her more anxiety being on a plane. The other guests, the stewardess, the staff is unable to control the woman from being completely irate in a matter of minutes and there's nothing to do in the meantime but constrain her with force. The plane is in an uproar and now has a woman detained from another disruption. This is obviously worst-case scenario with a phone call being made while in flight but it's not far from the point I'm trying to make: there are ways to avoid harmful situations, or even situations where passengers take advantage of the system.

The position the DOT has taken brings more of an option to consumers by choosing an airline, as I have previously stated. Thus customizing a passenger's flight experience, with or without cell phones, could promote customer loyalty. The prices in flights have inflated dramatically after the national security hype post-9/11 and this is one way to creatively push more sales for favored airlines.",,,,,,,

The comfort and pleasure of passengers is the business of the airline company. They can design rules that best address the wants and desires of customers (either to enjoy the near-silence of jet engines, babies crying, pilot announcements, and passengers talking to each other; or to be permitted to make needed phone calls). Airlines might choose to limit or ban voice calls, or to announce to passengers that loud and lengthy calls will disturb other passengers and should be avoided. The government does not currently regulate other ways in which passengers might be noisy and annoying on planes. To my knowledge, the government does not currently regulate other sorts of polite behavior on planes, nor does it regulate cell phone usage on other modes of transportation.  This is not an area the government has a responsibility to deal with.",,,,,,,

Particularly with the wide availability of data service in-flight and on the ground, which allows silent non-disruptive communication such as texting and emails, there is no need for in-flight calls.  Furthermore, most airlines generally allow voice calls once the plane has landed, allowing those few passengers who might prefer or need to make a voice call to arrange for ground transportation, etc., to do so during the usually ample time being landing and the time a passenger clears baggage claim and is ready for pick-up.  We live in a world where consumers are constantly wired, and we see the eroding of social courtesies on a daily basis -- texting and walking without looking where one is going, not turning off beeping video games during public transit, loud calls in public with incessant chatter.  Typically a request to a phone use to pay attention or turn down sound is met with rolling eyes or snappish comments (and seriously, I'm in my 30s, so please don't attribute my attitude to me being old and crochety).  Planes are too confined, passengers too tense and frankly phone users too inconsiderate to allow in-flight use.  I actually think voice calls would significantly raise the possibility of passengers getting into a heated argument that requires the intervention or attention of either flight attendants or other passengers, and that is both dangerous and distracting.  Security, safety and comfort for all should continue to be the mantra of our airborne transportation system, and voice calls are incompatible with each of those objectives. Thank you for your time.

I would suggest that a scaled-down SEPP would be appropriate for smaller systems.  All of the above mentioned programs (with the exception of the SEPP) have been in place for several years, but more and more components/requirements have been added over time. It is to the point where small transit systems are forced to add staff only to remain in compliance at a time when funding has decreased or remained stagnant.

The first one is the time that drivers are required to spend at shippers and receivers docks, which often runs into hours, and is often unpaid time to the carrier or driver. A shipper or receiver should be allowed 2 hours to complete their tasks of loading or unloading a truck. Beyond that there should be mandatory reimbursement to the carrier for detention, for any hour or part thereof that exceeds the 2 hour limit. This one little regulation would significantly improve every carriers productivity. It needs to be addressed.

The other item is the split sleeper berth regulation. Trucking is a 24/7 occupation. A driver may have pick ups or deliveries scheduled for any hour of the day or night. Under the old sleeper berth regulations, the 10 hours spent in the berth could be split in any fashion, and stop the 14 hour clock, as long as neither period was less than 2 hours. This rule was very effective in helping a driver adjust his sleeping schedule to his work schedule. It also helped drivers avoid gridlock in major metropolitan areas by allowing them to stop for a few hours, without penalty, prior to entering the city, to let the gridlock dissipate. Another big advantage to the old rule is that if a driver was sleepy during the day, he or she could stop and take a nap, without penalty, resulting in a better rested, and safer driver.

Under the new rule, only a period of 8 or more hours in the berth stops the 14 hour clock. That effectively takes away the drivers ability to sync his sleep schedule and work schedule, resulting in significant inefficiency. Drivers may also be forced to violate the hos rules, based solely the inability to sync them with the scheduling demands made by his or her companies dispatchers. 

Also drivers are now reluctant to take a break during the 14 hour window because they lose some of their productive time for the day. Where a driver may have stopped for a couple hour nap under the old rule, he or she will now continue to drive sleepy, to keep from losing any time on the 14 hour clock. A driver should have the flexibility to nap or sleep anytime their body is calling for it, without penalty.

Another adverse effect of the same rule: Under the old rule, a driver approaching a metropolitan area like Atlanta, near rush hour, might stop just outside the city and rest for a few hours to let the gridlock dissipate. Not only did that help the drivers efficiency by keeping him out of the gridlock, it helped the traffic conditions in the city because his truck was not in the middle of it. Under the new rule, the driver cannot do that without penalty to his productivity, because the 14 hour clock continues to run. So instead of stopping for a few hours, the driver will continue on into the gridlock and just hope for the best. 

While the new sleeper berth rule was made with good intentions, the adverse effects on productivity and safety have been significant. It needs to be changed back to the way it was.

FMCSA should stop trying to micro-manage a drivers day by regulating rest breaks, hours of sleep, consecutive 1 am to 5 am etc. I believe we can agree that we want everyone home safe at the end of any day.

This can be easily done by passing the electronic log mandate which will enable trucks and drivers to efficiently be tracked. Most drivers already are making less than minimum wage if you would take in consideration of the actual hours they invest in a week and an overtime rate after forty hours a week. Not many people are expected to work 70 hours in eight days or fourteen each day, as drivers are. Take into consideration they have to hunt for places to park, eat, and perform personal hygiene combined with the risk of performing the most safety crucial function in the industry, they should be fairly compensated. This would also help remove the fatigue factor of drivers being pushed, or them pushing themselves to earn more money by driving illegally outside of the of eleven hours limit, which DOT enforces.

Spending many hours trying to comprehend regulations while simultaniously having to manage or operate their fleet on a daily basis creates a sense of compunction .  Many regulations are addressed in an overlapping, or inferance style causing one to spend hours ""piecing"" together the whole intent of the regulation.  This overly complex system of regulations causes compliance failures.  

I would like to see the regulations re-written in such a manner that would be inclusive of extraneous or referenced applicable material that directly effects the application and compliance behavior. Thus, enabling operators to easily locate and read a comprehensive rule making compliance more amicable and sensible. 

Retiring those regulations that are redundant or no longer relevant, due to technological advances, would ease the ""man-hours"" expended by operators to maintain compliance and reporting requirements. The reduction in funding regulatory interpreters would have a positive financial impact on the operators and ensure better compliance.

This is documented through our response to the following federal dockets:  FHWA-2007-28977, FHWA-2010-0159, and FHWA-2012-0118.  Much of our response to this request for comments is quoted from our previous submissions to FHWA.

DelDOT firmly believes that states and local agencies should have flexibility in compliance with the federal MUTCD. Adherence to strict compliance dates to ensure the continuation of our federal transportation funds will undoubtedly draw away scarce resources from other transportation improvement projects, including our federally mandated Strategic Highway Safety Plan. We acknowledge the need to approach traffic safety in a proactive and uniform manner, which appears to be the underlying intent of FHWA’s significant modifications to the federal MUTCD, including the adoption of new compliance dates. However, we believe the proper way to address highway safety is through a data-driven, programmatic process and not with strict compliance periods for modifications to specific traffic control devices.

DelDOT agrees with FHWA that it is important to be proactive with regard to the management of traffic control devices to improve safety for the traveling public.  However, we believe that states and local agencies should be free to manage our respective transportation systems.  Without the federal compliance mandate, we can choose at the state/local level how best to use our limited resources, based on local traffic and safety data, including data gathered as part of the federally mandated Strategic Highway Safety Plan.  This may include bringing certain statewide traffic control devices into compliance with the MUTCD sooner, or may include many other safety/operational upgrades not directly related to these compliance dates.  Although it is difficult to quantify, it is possible that the effort to comply with the MUTCD compliance dates could adversely affect safety as a result of diverting limited resources away from other, more critical safety initiatives with documented safety problems.

To quote from the Federal Docket No. FHWA-2010-0159:  “In general, the FHWA has intended that target compliance dates coincide with the useful service life of the devices that would need to be replaced to meet any new requirements, thus minimizing economic and logistical impacts on highway agencies.”  This statement completely misses the point that any MUTCD compliance date forces local agencies to develop programs to address those compliance date issues, including efforts related to study, inventory, prioritization, design, funding, and construction.  The elimination of all compliance dates would be consistent with Executive Order 13563.

In January 2014, the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (NCUTCD) adopted the “20-Year Vision and Strategic Plan for the MUTCD.”  One of the recommendations of that plan is as follows:

“The MUTCD should not include compliance dates associated with the addition of or changes to MUTCD content. Where the implementation of new or revised MUTCD content should be accelerated, the establishment of specific deadlines for meeting MUTCD criteria should be established through memorandum or other administrative procedures.  Basis for recommendation: Placing compliance dates in the MUTCD creates legal requirements that cannot be adjusted without initiating rulemaking. Establishing implementation deadlines using procedures other than inclusion in the MUTCD provide flexibility for agencies to work with FHWA to best meet road user needs.”

In summary, DelDOT is opposed to any compliance dates in the MUTCD.  The inherently limited time, personal, and financial resources required to meet any compliance date will be better and more cost effectively utilized by state and local agencies in working on the study, engineering, and implementation of locally important matters, such as those identified through the federally-mandated Strategic Highway Safety Program.

This response does not address the specific questions posed in the docket regarding how the federal DOT should go about the second round of retrospective review under Executive Order 13563.  DelDOT may or may not comment specifically on those questions.  However, we wanted to take this opportunity to again raise this specific concern related to the MUTCD.

These comments are submitted on behalf of the Central Contra Costa Transit Authority (County Connection). County Connection operates fixed route and paratransit service within central Contra Costa County in the suburban San Francisco area. Our service area is over 200 sq. miles with a population of over 500,000. We provide over five million transit trips annually on a combined annual operating budget of just over 35 million dollars. 

I am writing to provide comments on the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) request for comments on the Next Phase of the Regulatory Review of Existing Department of Transportation (DOT) Regulations, published February 27, 2014 at 79 FR 11051.

OST has offered a number of options for managing this review process, including simply
asking for specific rules in need of review, focusing on a list identified by DOT in 2011, focusing on
a specific operating administration, or focusing on cross-cutting rules. We do not believe any of
these options are mutually exclusive and that all have merit, based on a wide range of factors.
There are specific rules that, standing alone, are unduly restrictive and cause the regulated
community to expend excessive time and money to achieve compliance. DOT should seek
recommendations on these specific rules to be reviewed.
The 56 rules cited in the Federal Register should be explained in greater detail. The reference
to Attachment 2 of the Department’s 2011 final plan leads to a reprint of a routine Section 610 notice
and does not clearly specify which of the rules the Department identified as having potential savings.
Once clarified, we would encourage OST to seek additional information from the public and use that
information to prioritize its list.
Since the impact of rules is often cumulative, OST should pursue a modal review to ascertain
the overall regulatory burden on the regulated community and specifically to identify those areas
where differing rules require the same or similar information to be processed and presented in
different ways. This review should not be limited to existing rules, but also those being developed.
Similarly, OST should focus on cross-cutting issues to eliminate unnecessary costs and
confusion. Buy America, with many differing interpretations of compliance, should be an immediate
focus. While the underlying statutes may differ, the differences are exacerbated in widely divergent
regulatory schemes and practices within the Department. Moreover, projects that draw funding from
more than one modal administration require clear guidance on what rule applies. As the Federal
Transit Administration crafts its safety program, OST must ensure that the program can reasonably
co-exist with the Federal Railroad Administration’s program to avoid duplicative, counter-productive
efforts.
Within this exercise, OST should also look to the various Circulars and other guidance
documents that have become de facto rules through practice, oversight, and other modal
administration actions. While an underlying regulation may be benign, the interpretation and
enforcement of the rule is often cumbersome. We have found that review processes have tended,
over time, to enlarge regulatory requirements through the threat of adverse findings and these de
facto rules carry the same potential for wasting time and money as formal regulations.
Finally, the Department should examine its rulemaking processes. Delay and uncertainty in
the regulatory process only compound the ill effects noted above. As an example, OST proposed
changes to its regulations related to services for people with disabilities in 2006. Over eight years
later, the proposals are still pending. Federal courts in multiple circuits have found them
unenforceable before they are finalized, yet they are regularly enforced through adverse review
findings. This leads to confusion for agencies providing the services, the passengers dependent on
the services, and the state and local governments responsible for funding the services.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

Under the original guidelines CNAV signals would have been broadcast back in 2003 but events prevailed to prevent that from happening. However, and this is an update to the numbers in the original Federal Register Notice, there are currently 12 GPS SVs on orbit capable of broadcasting civilian L2C CNAV signals and military code or MNAV messages. Additionally there are five GPS satellites (IIFs) on orbit capable of broadcasting L5 safety of life signals for DOT.
	Frankly the DOT objects to these signals being broadcast now for, in my humble opinion, very nebulous reasons, and the USAF is working hard to and has, again in my opinion, negated all of the DOTs concerns. Currently GPS is the reigning PNT Gold Standard. In order to maintain that status and indeed to continually exceed the capabilities of any of the current or planned PNT systems in existence today, the GPS needs these new signals. I predict CNAV and MNAV messaging capabilities will revolutionize the way PNT signals are utilized. These new signals bring about a capability heretofore unknown in the PNT arena; each CNAV and MNAV signal has the ability to broadcast 256 separate and definable messages to users globally. With 12 CNAV satellites on orbit today, global accessibility tests have shown that for the majority of users this means at least one CNAV SV in view at all times and you only need one CNAV SV in view to take advantage of the messaging capabilities. So the sooner the better I say - just imagine the possibilities.

Many such users are unaware of the technology they use; they just hook up the box and get excellent positioning and timing.
a.	Impact: Limited Impact. Only a small set of users would be affected, and none of these involves safety of life. Some of the applications are real-time, such as open pit mining, roadway grading, and precision agriculture. If undetected signal anomalies were to occur on CNAV signals, there could be significant economic impact since receivers would continue to operate using the anomalous signal. For digging and grading applications, this would result in the added expense of correcting the errors and having to do the work over. 
b.	Likelihood: Likely. Most receivers are single frequency using L1 C/A, so this would only affect the users who purchase high end equipment that track the new civil signals to improve accuracy and are used in realtime applications. Note that GNSS receiver manufacturers design their equipment to conform to GPS Interface Specifications which say that it is ok to use a healthy signal. They do not design their equipment to handle the case that “signal is healthy” could also mean “use at your own risk”.
2.	Risk: An anomaly occurs and is not addressed quickly, resulting in users being exposed to an aberrant signal. 
a.	Likelihood: Highly Likely. This condition persists until OCX is operational, assumed to take place as late as 2019; thus the risk will exist for about five years. While significant anomalies could occur as often as 3 times a year and last for up to six hours, the actual occurrence is on the order of once per year. Assuming there are five years until OCX with monitoring, It is reasonable to assume there will be several significant anomalies that will occur without monitoring conducted using the baseline OCS.
b.	Impact: Limited to Significant. Depending on the severity of the anomaly, the effect could be significant. Because many precision realtime civil applications today do not involve safety of life, the systems do not perform integrity checks, and thus are unable to reject aberrant signals. 
Issues.
1.	Testing on the CNAV message is incomplete. In 2013, significant tests were conducted in concert with the civils on a portion of CNAV messages and problems were identified. No further tests are proposed as far as I know on either the rest of the CNAV messages or on verifying the fixes for the first set of problems, so it is reasonable to assume that without further testing to confirm compliance, more issues involving non-compliance will appear.
2.	The operational protocols for health settings on legacy and CNAV navigation messages have not been worked out and published. Because of this, there will be ambiguity and varying implementations in user equipment. While the interface specifications provide the format and content of health settings in the messages, they are not define the operational management of the health indicators. GPS receivers and users are heavily affected by health settings, both in continuity of service and in timely response to anomalies. A documented operational management description for health settings is needed describing when and how each of the health indicators will be set. 
3.	Another issue to consider is whether the U.S. Government loses any legal protections if it intentionally misinterprets a setting in the publicly available interface specifications, namely declaring that the setting “Signal Health to Signal OK” also means the signal ""should be employed at the users' own risk”. Although the U.S. Government would have not declared the signals operational, such a position still would be not in compliance with published interface specifications.
 
Appropriate timeline.
If the decision is made to go ahead with broadcasting pre-operational CNAV messages, the following steps are recommended:
1.	Test CNAV in close cooperation with civil community. This means not only for the Air Force to run tests and report the results, but to let the civil community to run tests using their own equipment and under representative conditions for civil applications. This should be done in 2014 and as soon as possible.
2.	Develop an operational protocol for the CNAV signals in cooperation with the civil agencies. Publicly document how health settings will be handled. This should be done in 2014 and as soon as possible.

You are years late so the sooner the better.  Receiver developers need access to the live signals to start testing their incorporation into products.  We see very little risk in broadcasting pre-operational CNAV messages.  They use the same clocks and broadcast the same data on different channels and the existing signals provide ground truth for comparison.  Broadcast of this data will give the user community the opportunity to compare the quality of these signals and help build solutions that might be less impacted by interference.  This is a much better situation than the late 1980s when we only had a few satellites on-orbit and we did not have a full constellation of operating satellites with validated signals for comparison.",,,,,,,

The Airlines have so many ways to create and change fairs today, The same seat can sell for $99 or $1099 or any where between based upon demand and when it is being sole and to whom it is being sold to. Examples a seat being sold 6 months in advance may be discounted to $99, the same seat to a business traveler may go for $800 and the same seat to business the day of travel may go for $1099.

Why do we need to have a base price then add taxes/fees?  It should be just like the Gas station the price you see is the price you pay.  There should be a simple ""laundry list"" (the same for each Airline)  with ticket price (including taxes and fees) baggage fee, headset fee, meal fee, drink fee, Premium seat fee,  etc... and a grand total at the bottom.  Then we could compare prices between Airlines based upon price and schedule.

This proposal to separate the taxes and fees, I believe, give the airlines an even greater advantage in confusing the customer.  I have seen prices already that have taxes and fees removed that show a flight for $500 and when you go to book it the taxes and fees are over $500 more raising the total price to well over $1000, that's an additional 100+% (these were for international flights).

As a weekly traveler I very much want to have easier to read and evaluate the cost of my travel, not the opposite.

The poor business traveler gets so much abuse from the system, yet pays the higher percent of the costs, as short notices force last minute purchases.

The least your governmental agency can do is mandate concise and accurate information for the public to evaluate, not concealment and slight of hand like many of these companies want to practice. Just ask anyone who has traveled for over 30 years how much things have degraded and you will certainly get an earful.

Second, if there are no significant costs incurred by airlines, why is there opposition to a proposed regulation which would do nothing more than give consumers price information to allow them to make a sound consumer decision?

I am an American citizen living and working in Germany over the last decade an a half, and I have found it increasingly difficult to obtain up-front and clear pricing and conditions information with passanger airlines when I book intercontinental flights between Europe and the USA.

I fully endorse Transportation Secretary Foxx’s comments about ‘knowledge is power” for consumers.  In today’s age of rapidly found information on personal computers, the airlines and all parties offering airline ticket sales should be compelled to clearly state the bottom line when it comes to price.

One further comment on the format of the publicly available Air Travel Consumer Report - this should be augmented by an easy to use website that graphically and simply summarizes the airlines track record over the past few years so consumers can get up-to-date information before making final decisions to book airline tickets.

I'll offer a very good example on how undisclosed ancillary fees have directly affected me as a consumer.  My husband's uncle died and I had to find 3 round trip tickets from Omaha, NE to Myrtle Beach, SC, with less than a week's notice.  I ended up choosing to drive to and fly out of Kansas City, MO to save $200 per ticket.  The published airfare was $x.  I started the booking process and went to the next-to-last screen to select seats.  The seating chart said that every seat was UN-available - unless I paid $25 per each of the 3 legs for each of the 3 tickets, adding a total of $150 to each of the 3 tickets.  This allowed me to choose ""Economy Plus"" seats, which according to the phone representative, were the only seats available for purchase.  The flights were from MCI to ORD, ORD to ATL, ATL to FLO (where we rented a car and drove the rest of the way).  The MCI to ORD and ATL to FLO routes designate the first few front rows as ""Economy Plus"", but there are no distinctions in seat width or pitch on those regional jets.  (One regional jet had the airline name ""Air Wisconsin"" still painted on the side of the jet!)  The flight from ORD to ATL did have a dedicated Economy Comfort section, with the better seats.  

The only reason I chose to pay the extra $150 was that my father-in-law needed a little extra help in flying and by choosing seats, I could offer that extra help to him.  It was not necessary that all three of us needed to sit together, and the small size of the regional jets didn't require that someone be with my father-in-law.  But the booking process required that all 3 of us pay the extra fee, for every leg of the flight, whether there was a benefit there or not.
 
Had I been better informed of this at the start of the booking process, I would have chosen a more direct flight, directly from Omaha to Myrtle Beach, rather than trying to ""save"" $200 per ticket by driving to Kansas City from Omaha and then from Florence to Myrtle Beach, since the ""savings"" turned out to be $50 per ticket for the flights.  

I purchased my tickets on US Airways, which code-shared United Airlines flights to create the itinerary.  Neither US Airways or United were the real carriers on the two regional jet segments - their name was not on the equipment, but only on the ticket.  Delta would have been a far better choice - if only I'd known all the options at the beginning of the booking process.

Thank you for proposing this regulation.  This example is only the most egregious one in the last two years.",,,,,,,

This industry has taken this basic marketing idea to extremes.  If the hotel industry followed the airline lead, they would provide you only a room and bathroom.  Sheets, pillows, towels, toiletries, phone, TV, would all be extra.  This is why the airlines are unique and should be treated as such: they alone have stripped their service totally bare.  Furthermore, there need to be regulations to cover refunds for baggage lost or damaged.  Their lost/ damaged baggage  procedures developed years ago when baggage service was free (in the ticket price).  I think they should provide a full refund of baggage charges if the bag it not provided to the consumer within 24 hours and pay a 50% penalty if the baggage is not returned within 48 hours.  Despite these comments I am a real fan of what the airlines do.

Why should the airlines have to include government mandated taxes and fees in their rates?  Think about it, hotels, department stores, bus companies, rental cars, and virtually every other business are not required to include theses costs into their advertised prices? 

2.)	The government doesn’t have a very good record of truth in advertising.  Let’s take its gambling monopoly for example.  The Lotto ads scream you can win $20 million! But wait, that’s before you lose about half to taxes and collect the other half over 20 years.  If you want it all at once that’s at a much lower payout.

3.)	As far as regulating seat pre-assignment fees and baggage fees, so what?  The airlines have simply adopted to the model of keeping rates low for the basic flight and charge people for the extras, including food.  What’s wrong with that.  Let’s face it, the airline business if very risky and many of them fail.  When that happens we all lose.

4.)	On time performance?  Let that policy be driven by competition too.  The ones who have better records will use that information at the expense of those who do not.

5.)	Here’s another idea for accessing the data.  The FAA, knows when every flight in the country departs.  Let them share this data online so enterprising people can correlate this information with the airline schedules.  Problem solved.

6.)	Mandated disclosure of mishandled baggage rates?  These are still private businesses and should not be forced to disclose this information any more than FedEx or UPS.  The internet is a very effective way for millions of passengers to share information, both positive and negative.  If an airline is losing luggage at an unacceptable rate they will be paying the price in lost business.

7.)	Regarding trying to regulate bias in travel Web sites, can we first ask that the owners, editors, writers, broadcasters, etc. in the media disclose their own political leanings so that readers/viewers can factor that bias out of their reporting?

8.)	It would be great if Congress was as transparent as it wants the airlines to be. 

If Congress really wants to make the cost of flying transparent, then let’s make the government responsible for publicizing the taxes and fees it mandates and stop trying to pretend that the airlines are somehow responsible for them.

I would like to see the flight/fare search engines (and airline's own websites) require that you enter number of bags, any elite status(es) with carrier(s) and seat preferences at the same time as entering the date(s) of travel and the origin and destination information to produce a comparable prices across all the available options.  

I am also excited to see a step towards less ""bait-and-switch"" practices with code-shares or contract carriers.  It seems unfair advertising, in my view, if I buy a ticket on ""Delta"" (because I truly enjoy the carrier's service and aircraft features/amenities) but then find myself flying another carrier (or feeder) because the two carriers agreed to partner.  It is great and convenient for the airlines but as a customer, I am sold one thing and received another.  

Also, other (travel) services that generally come with a myriad of ""disguised"" fees are car rentals and hotels.  The taxes, including local ""occupancy"" taxes, surcharges, amenities and ""resort"" fees can vary dramatically and are generally unknown until I check out and see the bill.  It's almost never a pleasant surprise.

Where is Consumer Protection when you need them?

I'd also like to mention that, in the past, getting pillows and blankets and meals were not 'free' once you purchased a ticket, but were covered in the cost of the ticket.

Having all the fees clearly identified at time of booking will help us consumers determine the true cost of our travel.  Please implement this rule as quickly as possible.

In a similar vein, can the DOT look into a cap for ticket change fees?  In the age of the computers, it does not cost an airline $200 to switch a passenger to a different flight.  It probably costs $0 since human interaction is not even required.  Airlines charge these fees because they can.

The issue of Airlines is of Government interference in what is no longer a reality of TOO BIG TO FAIL but rather too big too succeed. I will be writing a more complete piece on this, specifically the merger of United and Continental Airways being the anatomy of what goes wrong when government intervenes going for bottom lines rather than, as I experience first hand, a clash of airline cultures.

It was mindblowing that one could see on my recent flight the stark difference between the United Airlines employees and the employees from Continental.

It was mind blowing to see how foreign regulators are to what goes on in the belly of the beast, so to speak, where the passenger and airline intersect. A culture survives only when it does not cannabalize its own, as the airline industry is doing to its passengers.

My piece I will be writing then posting to my site THE CENTER FOR COPYRIGHT INTEGRITY www.centerforcopyrightintegrity.com will trail the experience of customers departing DC to Newark, some staying, some connecting. That was in fact not the case.

Our plane was hit on the runway by a tug truck, hard enough the plane shook threatening to go over, hard enough to require, eventually, all passengers to deplane. Luggage remained on board for those passengers preferring to avoid lines at carousels. Sort of. Luggage for three passengers making noise was removed. Crew failed miserably at connecting to passengers. Those staying in Newark or nearby were ok to wait. Those catching connecting flights were misled as to connecting to flights. Again, I will detail this in the article that will post to my ezine- www.centerforcopyrightintegrity.com

Alot was learned. The flight staff in DC failed in Customer relations. Passengers were mismanaged. Rolling terminals should have been brought in ASAP to get Connecting passengers to other flights as not to miss connections abroad. Some destinations have only one flight a day. Ground crew with anxiety in crisis should have been yanked ASAP. 

This is for starters. On record is that a plane filled with passengers feared safety when the plane was hit on the ground. NOT on the record is that United Airlines reported the flight problem as an Airtraffic Controller issue. It was not. The plane was hit by a truck. There is a penalty for filing fraudulent papers. This penalty must be followed through with against United.

Passengers learned from crew how unhappy United employees are with their current CEO. Hate would be a kind word after seeing how pained good employees are to having to do a bad job they feel does not reflect them.

To capsulize what will be detailed in the piece I will write and will be illustrated with printouts from emails and some pics, it seems United is gambling as to who will complain demanding customer respect and who will not.

Multiple emails were received from United Airlines ""updating"" on the plane departure. Crew were guaranteeing connecting flights would be caught they were not. There was no effort to bring courtesy water or food to passengers who were refused being put on connecting flights but were put back on the plane, eventually, sitting in heat without water until eventually the plane could find a slot to take off.

Oh, yes, the plane had to be looked at before it could take off. THE mechanic was called. No, not A mechanic was called but THE mechanic was called. He had other issues to adress before he could get to this United Airlines plane to vet it airworthy. Passengers connecting to other flights missed their flights. There was no outreach to passengers of any courtesy sort. IF passengers complained they were led to customer service reps to rebook new flights. This was in and around 10+ at night. 

By the time re-bookings were done, IF passengers complained they were offered a hotel voucher. IF passengers complained they were starved, by this point, they were given a $7 food voucher. Ever buy a coffee in the airport? 7 bucks does not go very far. Customers were told United's CEO orders is that food vouchers and hotel vouchers are for disabled, old and kids, not for other customers. The United reps all said, 'we wish we could do more.' Not with the CEO they currently have.

Of note now, is the bag on the plane scam that takes place. Any bag that cannot be put overhead and is deplaned, goes under the plane FOR FREE, unfair in flights where passengers are penalized for bags sent below. Penalize & charge passengers that want express access carrying bags on board. Let passengers storing bags below go for free. 

Do I expect to see United last too long in the airs? In a culture where cheap flights are sought, mmm, for a bit. Long term? Not at all. People may be cheap but not stupid learning more about the culture of airlines through the conduit of the Internet. Remember, give me about a week for me to write my complete illustrated piece...

Of course we were shocked, stricken with grief and afraid that we would miss the funeral. We called United to ask them what could be done, and how much it would cost to change our flight to an earlier one. The lady we spoke to said that we would be responsible for the cost in the change in airfare and that the fee would be $300 per person, but that we could expect to get $250 per person back if we file for a refund with the death certificate. I told her $100 was definitely affordable and thanked her and United for being so compassionate, flexible and understanding. She then asked when we would like to leave, and we said that we had to be there by Friday 2/7/14 at the latest if we were going to make it to the funeral. She told us she found a flight that left on 2/6 and arrived on 2/7. I talked it over with my wife, and we agreed $100 was well worth the change of flights and I gave her my credit card information. She told me that credit card (my Capital One CC) wasn’t working, so I then gave her my Priceline Rewards Visa which worked. We were then in a frenzy to wrap up what we had planned on doing for the next few weeks in the next couple days. I checked my email at 1am 2/6/14 (the morning of our flight) when I was forwarding my itinerary to my dad. That’s when I noticed that there was an additional charge of $519.96 for me and $519.96 for my wife beyond the two $300 charges that we discussed. I was never told these figures over the phone, nor did I agree to pay for them. Consequently, the lady had charged my Capital One card for the $600, and the Priceline Card for the $1039.92. Again, I was not under the impression that both cards were even being used. After countless hours waiting on hold and over a month waiting for a reply from customer service, we were able to get the two charges of $250 back as promised, but were given the cold shoulder about the two $519.96 charges. I told them I would no longer shop with United and left them with a few suggestions that you may wish to include in your docket:

1. Customer service representatives should always tell their customers the total charges they are agreeing to pay. 
2. Customer service representatives should not say a credit card isn't working, and then still charge money on it. They should clearly explain how much money is being charged on each credit card. 
3. Customer service representatives should be trained to be very clear and honest with customers suffering from shock and grief. It would even be nice to have a special customer service representative that is skilled at talking with customers suffering from grief and have customers who fit that criteria forwarded to them. 
4. Customer service representatives should be given more latitude in helping customers come to a fair resolution of conflicts without being bound by red tape. 
5. Customer service representatives shouldn't be a minimum of a 20 minute hold away. 
6. Customers should receive a response to a written dispute in a timely manner.
7. Customer service representatives should have accurate and stable feedback on what to do when their customers are experiencing a dispute and not to give conflicting information. 
8. Customer service representatives should listen to their customers instead of reading a script.

Unfortunately, that isn’t even the end of the story. When we got to the airport in Prague for our return flight, we were told that the specific airline partner that United contracts with only allows 8 kilograms for the total weight for the personal item and carry-on luggage because their airplane is so small. Since our checked luggage was already close to the maximum weight (from wedding presents), we couldn’t put the things in our carry-on into our checked luggage and were forced to pay an additional 80 euro to check one of our carry-on bags. This is another hidden fee that you should be aware of. These types of fees should be clearly explained when purchasing the original airfare from Kayak, United or whoever sells the ticket so it reflects all potentially hidden fees. In the end, we were charged close to $1200 more than what we ever had anticipated, which has created a tremendous financial hardship for me and my wife during an already difficult time in our lives (getting married, starting a life together and losing her brother).

Airline pricing is now partially hidden and sneaky, and it is difficult to find out the true cost of flying from point A to point B with a checked bag, a carry on, and an assigned seat.  Finding the cost with adjacent assigned seats, e.g. a family, is even harder.  Some airlines, e.g. Spirit. Allegient, and to a growing extent, Frontier, are difficult to find out the total cost without beginning the purchase process of submitting personal information and possibly payment information.  I inquired Spirit once the cost of an assigned seat on a specific route, and they were very elusive, saying somewhere between $1 and $99 per passenger.

The regulations are not burdensome.  All passengers request is honest pricing.  We buy a book, TV, appliance, etc., and we see a price.  We try to buy an airplane ticket, and maybe it costs us an extra $200-300 with baggage fees, carry-on fees, and increasingly assigned seat fees.",,,,,,,

If so, then the bottom line for me as a consumer is to know what I'm getting into when I click ""Purchase ticket."" 

Information that would be especially useful if on the same purchase web page so the true price of a flight can be computed:

""Any change will cost $350""
""All checked bags $100 per bag"" 
""No gratis food service./No food available for purchase.
""The extra $75 for this seat does not buy a larger seat, only more legroom""
""No carry-on luggage allowed that does not fit under the seat."" 

And so on. 

Make them reveal everything.

Airfare is but one component, and others include baggage fees, sales tax, airport and other taxes or fees, seat assignment, food and beverages, use of toilet, use of overhead compartment, etc. Definitions are critical to ensure consistency for both airlines and consumers.

Their attitude seems to be that if we don't like it, don't fly; but the truth is that in this day and age if we have to get between point A and point B in a reasonable amount of time we have to fly.  Personally, I would like to see rapid rail.  Many of my friends and neighbors have said that if we had rapid rail, they would ditch the airlines completely.  Why not have the competition?  I don't expect the airlines to run in the red. I do wonder though whether high gas prices was the only reason that they were failing before.  Could it be the outrageous salaries and benefits of top management also contributed to their losses?  Also, they seem to compensate employees from ground agents to the top with several free flights a year I worked with a person back in the 1980's who told me she had several free flights a year for the rest of her life..(she was laid off from her job as a boarding flight desk job)   She was only in her late thirty's at the time.  Multiply that thousands of times over plus inflation.  I retired from the telephone company, but I don't get free telephone service and I worked over thirty years both in craft and management positions.  I get a $15 discount - that's it.

I believe all airlines should be required to reveal and include all fees in the cost of the ticket so that travelers know the true cost of the flight.  Flying as much as I do I am aware of the hidden fees so I can truly compare costs. The hidden fee situation has gotten out of hand; pay extra for a bag, pay extra for a certain seat, pay for food and drink while on the flight.  The last time I had to fly on American the flight attendants were selling head sets, snacks, drinks; it was like being in a flea market.

Bottom line, the practice is deceitful and dishonest and abuses the traveling public.

I am an eighty-five year-old economist and Internationalist (semi-retired, but sill a domestic and international air traveller) who commenced flying (DC-3s and later DC-4s) in the mid-1950s when flying was a fun-adventure and passengers were treated with respect and not treated as cash cows to be nefariously and systematically fleeced. 

 Since that time I have logging over one million miles with Pan Am/Delta, well over half that with British Air and untold hundreds of thousands with American Airlines and Lan Chile.  

In the last two decades, I have watched with dismay most airlines' abandonment of (1) calculating the cost of an economy, a business or a first-class seat from point A to point B, (2) adding an amount to equal a fair and reasonable profit and overhead (and, sometimes a temporary surcharge to cover the wildly fluctuating cost jet fuel) ... and (3) openly and transparently posting the cost for those wishing to make a straightforward comparison with other carriers for the same trip.

And I watched with equal dismay (combined with no small amount of frustration and anger) as all airlines commenced making it ever more difficult to make use of frequent-flyer miles accumulated as the result of ongoing, loyalty.  As I am sure you are aware, today, making use of frequent-flyer miles with most airlines is beyond challenging. 

Notwithstanding my concern over the growth of our government in Washington, it is my opinion that (most) airlines have joined hands in a price-gouging campaign that must be stopped–and, it appears the only way to make that happen is via legislation. 

Clearly, you can not legislate friendliness, cordiality and politeness toward passengers by air carriers.  Nor, can you dictate what amount of profit and overhead airlines add to the cost of an economy, business or first-class ticket.  However, it is my earnest hope that whatever legislation you consider proposing as law puts an end to nickel-and-diming and fuzzy math used by airlines in the process of squeezing passengers. 

Additionally, it is my hope that you analyze the less-than-fair policies used by airlines regarding the near impossibility of making use of ""rewards"" accumulated by frequent fliers. 

Very sincerely,

PS  I respectfully urge you to locate, read—and heed—a recent column written by Christopher Elliott (Special for USA TODAY) entitled ""What Comes With an Airline Ticket""?  I pray you will agree that Elliott;s thoughts express the opinion of all American voters who travel by air (with the likely exception of the price-gouging airline executives whose unwelcome ""stick-it-to-em,"" bizarre pricing and frequent-flyer-redemption policies have allowed them to rake in billions ... all legally).  Until reading this highly topical, succinct and well-written article, I was unaware that these geniusus and the well-paid lobbyists now seek to harvest even more from passengers with their underhanded schemes. I believe I speak for many when I express my trust that your agency will bring the airline industry back to some form of normalcy. ",,,,,,,

The first baggage fee I think is unreasonable as most people are traveling for vacation and some have children. Fees for sporting equipment should a flat fee such as $25 or $35 and not a fee of $50. I would rather a flat fee for the ticket and list the restrictions and not have a SURPRISE WHEN ARRIVING AT THE AIRPORT.

My strong feeling is that there should NEVER be a charge for either checked or ( even worse ), carry-on bags. A suitcase or carry-on is a prerequisite of any sort of travel, so when did some idiot come up with the idea of making extra millions by charging for an essential item?? We have become (almost) resigned to the elimination of any food or snacks on board, but the addition charges which we must endure, such as the right to sit with your family members, are ridiculous!

 I'm in favor of boycotting travel on those airlines which add on all of the above, and more, and limiting air travel to those who do not- Jet Blue and Southwest.

I am generally supportive of the proposals. However, I have a suggested addition for disclosures of change fees.

With respect to section 399.80(p), I am less concerned about the ticket agents than the air carriers themselves who impose many of the policies and fees which the ticket agents are obliged to enforce.  

Specifically, from my personal experience, it is a common practice for air carriers to adjust their schedules over the course of time (e.g., 3-12 months) AFTER a passenger has already purchased a ticket.  The passenger can be adversely impacted by shortened connections (connecting flight, cruise). despite having already planned for what seemed to be sufficient contingencies.

In such cases, a passenger only has a limited right to change or cancel his/her reservation based on a ""single"" change by the air carrier within a few days after notice of the change.  The passenger neither has any rights nor is entitled to any compensation when an air carrier chooses to change the schedule multiple times.  The air carrier has no mutuality of obligation while the passenger is subject to exorbitant change fees.  The air carriers to have the authority to change schedules and impact customers travel at will without regard to the cumulative effect on the customers and without compensation.  

I personally have had two recent occurrences where the air carrier has changed its schedule a minimum of three times - individually being a half hour here or an hour there  When the changes are accumulated, though, the changes in schedule can be in excess of 2 hours with no monetary consequence to the air carrier. In one case, my schedule changed in excess of 3 hours with a connecting flight.

Since air carriers can impose such exorbitant change fees (e.g., up to $200), passengers should have some renumeration for an airlines change in schedules, including a cumulative change. Alternatively, air carriers should be obligated to disclose their change fee policy, including a right to cancel or fare adjustment equal to the airline's current change fee policy.  If the air carrier changes, its schedule multiple times over the course of the passenger's reservation, then the passenger should have the right to change the schedule without being subject to a change fee up through the day of actual travel or cumulative credit adjustments, at the discretion of the passenger.

Section 399.80(p) and/or other appropriate sections should be modified to disclose the air carrier's policies, the air carrier's obligations and the passenger's rights if an air carrier ""changes"" a flight in excess of [15] minutes for a single change or in excess of [60] minutes for cumulative, multiple changes since the reservation was originally made.  Consideration should be given as to whether air carriers should be required to waive any change fees through the actual date of departure if the air carrier changed the schedule more than [once] since the passenger's original reservation.

[Excerpt of pertinent Proposed Regulation]
""§ 399.80
Unfair and deceptive practices of ticket agents.
It is the policy of the Department to regard the practices enumerated in paragraphs (a) through (m) of this section by a ticket agent of any size and the practices enumerated in paragraphs (o) through (r) of this section by a ticket agent that sells air transportation and has annual revenue of $100 million or more as an unfair or deceptive practice or unfair method of competition:
* * * * *
(p) Failure to disclose cancellation policies applicable to a consumer's selected flights, the aircraft's seating configuration, and lavatory availability on the aircraft on its Web site, and upon request, from the telephone reservations staff.

In summary and respectfully, the proposed regulations should require further disclosure of the air carriers policies, the air carrier's obligations and the passenger's rights with respect to change fees.""

Thank you for this opportunity to comment and DOT's commitment for transparency in travel fees and passengers' rights.

Respectfully submitted,

Gary Renick

Carriers SHOULD be prohibited from imposing such restrictions for any ticket agent.  In addition, as long as airlines are allowed to keep display/sales restrictions in place for any agent, then agents SHOULD NOT have to disclose to consumers whether or not options on other carriers may exist.    

This is due to for several reasons as follows:

Currently, some airlines do not allow any or all agents to display fares to the public, even though the airline doesn't compensate the ticket agent for any bookings, nor does the agent request commission.  For example, Southwest (WN) historically hasn't allowed any agent to book fares online.  In addition, Delta (DL) allows Priceline, Expedia, Orbitz, & Travelocity to display fares, but has stopped the 2nd tier of ticket agents in terms of volume to display DL's fares as of 3 yrs ago.  This includes agents such as CheapOAir.com, LasVegas.com, BookIt.com, Onetravel.com, etc... Unlike WN, which does not allow any agent to book its fares online, DL is now cherry-picking the agents that it chooses to allow to display and book fares, presumably based on contract or volume of business.  Most agents would gladly display/book fares from these 2 airlines if permitted to do such, as most agents earn income from the commissions on associated hotel bookings.  Why should these agents have to disclose that other airlines may be available on each web search and suffer the loss of business each time a consumer reads the disclosure and searches elsewhere?  The agents would gladly display all fares/itineraries if allowed to by the airlines.  Keep in mind that DL was one of the 1st airlines that eliminated commissions for most US travel agents more than 10 yrs ago and with the few exceptions, or special contracted situations, 0 commission on the air portion of an itinerary is now standard for most agents.  

I agree it is a disservice to the consumer who prefers to use one of the 2nd tier agents to not have all fares/itineraries displayed.  However, airlines that are not displayed are at a disadvantage due to their own business decision, and not the agent's decision.  If a consumer chooses to book on AA over DL via a 3rd party due to DL's decision to remove fares from the 3rd party, then it is DL who has created the disservice to the consumer, not the agent.  

Using a comparison example, if I want to buy a ""Widget"", and there are exactly 10 companies that make Widgets, I can go to any store I choose to buy a widget.  If 2 companies that produce ""Widgets"" decide not to supply the product to the store that I choose, I am limited to purchase one of the 8 Widgets from other companies.  Even though all Widgets are at various prices, and have various qualities, should the store be required to display a sign that states ""There may be other companies that produce Widgets not carried by this store"".  In my opinion, the answer to this question is not only ""NO"", but it is absurd to regulate such signage.     

In addition, there are many airports where DL has a monopoly on air service, which means that any consumer who prefers to use one of the websites that have been shunned by Delta who is looking for an itinerary to and/or from one of the airports where Delta is the only carrier cannot book thru their preferred agent.  These airports include, but are not limited to DHN, ABY, AGS, BQK, CSG, VLD, PIH, TWF, APN, ESC, IMT, PLN, CIU, BJI, BRD, HIB, INL, GTR, BTM, EKO, GFK, ABR, CDC, RHI.

Please note that while DL receives federal subsidies for many of the cities listed due to the Essential Air Service program, their actions toward agents' ticketing abilities limit interstate commerce, as the agents that DL chooses to discriminate against have customers residing in all states.  In addition to the previous airports listed, there are numerous airports where DL is 1 of 2 carriers that operate.  At these airports, due to DL's actions, agents are relegated to only displaying 1 carrier due to DL's decision, not the agent's.     

In summary I am questioning the fact as to why should an agent who wishes to display a certain carrier's fares, but is prohibited from doing so by the carrier, have to market that some fares may not be displayed, and thus drive away business?  In these cases, I would assume the agent wishes to keep the consumer as their customer, and wants to offer all carriers' fares, even if this means that the consumer chooses an airline for which the online ticket agent is not compensated by the airline.

However, we lack sufficient data to be able to quantify the extent of this problem for consumers.” The Department then requests comment from consumers.
The dilemma need not be pointed toward the consumer. The Department should be looking at the financial results for the carriers that show why the unbundling has occurred. Airlines have become more profitable! It has been reported that airlines earned more than $2.8 billion in ticket change fees alone in 2013. How many more billion were earned on other fees? A good deal of this income is because they have deliberately decided to confuse consumers, taking advantage of many individuals and families that are not flying every day. Revenue is clearly the only reason why they unbundled and why they will continue to be deceptive unless stopped by regulation!  The airlines complain about paying higher fees to the GDS firms but clearly continue to drain every cent possible from their customers.
Since the department lacks sufficient data to protect the consumer, the department should err on the side of caution and simply change the rule so that all fees must already be included in the price being offered to the consumer. That goes for the airlines, GDS firms and all others! Let them make a buck honestly not by duping their clientele! Why do we need so much complication? Just take a step back in time.
In lieu of my simplified approach, Proposal #1 that requires carriers to disclose fee information for basic ancillary services to all ticket agents to which a carrier provides its fare information, including GDSs, should be implemented.

If you order by phone, there is an additional charge of $1.00 or $9.73
If you order in person, the charge is 50 cents or $9.23
If you pay by cash, there is a surcharge of 25 cents or $9.98
If you pay by credit or debit card, there is a surcharge of 5% of the total bill to cover the cost of running it through the credit card machine or an additional 44 cents.

Our economy is based, at least theoretically, on the concept of open competition.  Therefore, sellers should be prepared -- and required -- to provide potential buyers with all information regarding the goods or services they offer and their full cost. As this is currently not the case when buying airline tickets, the proposed regulation would go a long way toward ensuring that airline ticket buyers will have the information we need to evaluate competing offers before making a choice. 

I do urge you to revise the proposed language that reads, ""Currently, some consumers may be unable to understand the true cost of travel...""   As written, it implies the ""inability"" to know the true cost lies with the consumer's inability to ""understand"" that cost.  This is patently untrue.  The consumer's inability to ""understand"" the cost is caused by the failure of some sellers to provide complete information upfront to the consumer.

They ought to go back to the old way of charging a fair price for them to make a profit, but to buy a ticket these days really has little or no meaning, when only considering the ticket price.  In fact, a ticket price means actually nothing any more.

If they have nicer planes or a better class service, advertise that against their price for travel.  Don't ""seperate"" out the ""services"" with a fee for each part of the travel process.  The next thing on the ticket will be tire and break wear fees for landings at higher elevation airports because the plane has to work harder to stop.

The airline flying public needs a clear and fully understandable ticket pricing system before a passenger purchases a flight ticket that allows a purchaser to compare airline prices.  One other comment is the purchase of an airline ticket automatically should ensure the purchaser a seat without any doubt, and preferably a selected seat. No one who has purchased an airline ticket should be informed when arriving at the airport his ticket price did not include a seat. Also, when a larger plane is switched to a smaller one, passengers should have the option to select their seat if possible. Flight changes should not cancel out passengers seat selection. Bundling  should not be permitted, for it is a gimmick to get around ticket transparency.

Travel is difficult enough without having to concern oneself about 'add-ons"", fees and other charges after you have made your bookings. It is ludercrious that one has to juggle cash or cards to pick up unforseen charges that are being levied by the different airlines when checking in. 
They must be included in any quotes/confirmations  before one can accept the charges. All fees/taxes//charges for different airports, baggage, foods, entertainment etc., so one knows that they are completely covered when the booking is made.  Flyers can then book-in at the airport, travel & exit the other end without hasels and more stress. Isn't that what all the airlines say/said?
"" Welcome aboard & enjoy the flight""  
Do not allow this to happen to all travelers, local and overseas alike!

Also,.
insist on NO to in flight use of cell phones. Who wants to listen to someone else's endless and mindless crap during a flight. What a nightmare! It was once considered manners to consider other peoples feelings etc. and no one is that important to be excused. They tell everyone so they know what they are doing- flying- whoppee! Let them call on  Landing - period! The world will still be there to meet them. If this is to be allowed then you must insist that a 'phone booth' is installed next to the 'loo's if they just can't wait to let all their buddies know where they are at. PLAH-EESSSSSS!

I understand the airlines are arguing for ""transperancy"" of pricing.

This expensive proposal adds complexity to an already convoluted and fragile regulatory environment in which airlines and related entities have to operate. This also adds a burden on the Department of Transportation, and therefore on taxpayers, to track and react to yet another dimension of the quickly evolving global airline industry - in which I believe the DOT already has a heavy presence. It is not the responsibility of a rigid, slow-to-react, taxpayer-funded regulatory agency to dictate pricing models for widely varying airlines and related entities within a vibrant and competitive industry. 

I also believe that the DOT overestimates its own importance, proposing rules with real costs in order to micromanage pricing on behalf of consumers that voluntarily participate in transactions with this industry. If a consumer is deeply and truly unhappy with the pricing model of their chosen airline, they can simply choose not to fly with that airline again. If enough consumers are unhappy, the airline will correct its actions much more quickly and nimbly than the DOT could ever hope to. As a taxpayer, I ask that you do not spend my taxpayer dollars to legislate, monitor, and enforce rules that consumers are not asking for. While some industry practices are not inherently self-regulated via market forces, this is not one of them, nor is it impactful enough for a taxpayer-funded agency to take notice.

I am a software engineer in the banking industry and a moderately frequent flyer. My perspective comes from first-hand experience of the real costs and headaches of implementing and maintaining the technology needed to comply with similar types of rules. These costs must be paid somehow, and are reflected in higher prices for typical consumers. ",,,,,,,

Business Travel Coalition welcomes the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) publishing of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding new airline consumer protections. Consumers will benefit from greater price transparency by the Department’s proposal to require airlines to provide real-time pricing of core ancillary services (e.g., for checked bags) wherever they sell their tickets. However, DOT must require that ancillary fee information is disseminated to travel agents in an efficient manner that is truly usable by agents and we urge the agency to ensure that consumers can purchase these services from travel agents at the same time as an airline ticket.

The more consumers trust a shopping and purchasing process the more likely it is that they will buy more products and services more often. Over the long term, providing strong consumer protections will increase competition, create market efficiencies, encourage innovation, expand markets, increase sales and satisfy customers.

To whomever it may concern,

A free market depends on both parties having adequate information to make decisions. This is an absolute must if the market is to function properly. Unfortunately, certain airlines have taken it upon themselves to undermine this market. Certain airlines have started to exclude taxes and fees, and then even begin to exclude things that citizens believe to be standard, such as checked bag fees.

This is a major problem as it means that responsible airlines that provide the full price to their customers get pushed out of the market. Irresponsible companies, meanwhile, convince customers to purchase their under-priced tickets, only to hit them with fees later on. This is exactly what government is for, to ensure a properly functioning and well regulated market where both sides can make well informed decisions. If airlines are required to disclose all fees then citizens will have the information necessary to make a well-informed choice. 

I urge the Department of Transportation to adopt the proposed rule and ensure that the airline market is not undermined by companies that fool their customers. Without this rule it may well be possible that the most successful airline will not be the one with best service or lowest cost, but the one that is best at hiding its various fees and slicing up the cost of a ticket into a plethora of fees to be paid at the airport. Do not let the market be undermined, adopt the proposed rule.

I think I am most offended by the A4A line that the rule would probably “further increase airline expense, and force airlines to pass on the additional costs to customers in the form of higher fares or reduced levels of air service.”  While I suspect there are probably some finer points elsewhere in the rule that I’m missing:

•	These are not “additional” costs, they are the same costs you are already charging, but under a different name
•	Thus, they are not “higher fares”; they are the same total amount as before.  A rose by any other name….
•	It would likely be less administrative cost by not having the extra bookkeeping processes
•	There is no “reduced level of service” – that plane will still fly the same route, with the same amount of my money… or you wouldn’t be in that market in the first place.

Here’s a wild idea:  advertise  “Total cost – Yes, Really..   No Added Fees Ever.”  Use the extra $65 the other guys are charging you, when you get to the hotel bar in Maui.    I’d appreciate the honesty… and the competition would follow pretty quickly.

Airlines have found it all too easy to add hidden fees and charges, only to spring them on customers at the last minute. This is a deceptive business practice and has no place in a system that is already confusing enough to travelers. The DOT should define what a standard airline ticket entails, and require airlines to advertise the full price of that ticket, including any additional fees that might be charged for services within that definition.

Airlines may argue that in a free marketplace, they should be permitted to advertise their lowest base fare, and then charge additional fees for the services not provided by that base fare. This argument contains two fatal flaws, however. 

First, airlines are not specific about what services a customer is purchasing for that ""base fare"", so they cannot be held accountable for price and/or fee changes. In any other context, the concept of paying hundreds or thousands of dollars, months in advance, for a service that is not in the slightest guaranteed, would be considered ridiculous. For instance, a customer may purchase a $100 ticket in January for a flight in April with the understanding, based on the (often rather confusing) information made available by the carrier, that he/she is entitled to bring one carry-on aboard as part of the price. The airline, however, could institute a $25 carry-on bag fee in March, and then charge that customer for his/her carry-on, despite the fact that he/she was led to believe that the full price of travel was $100 (not $125). This is highly deceptive and violates the principle behind truth-in-advertising laws.

Second, the marketplace is not as free as airlines might suggest. Travelers do not have the flexibility to change their plans at a moment's notice and switch airlines if the first airline decides to institute fees that travelers might find unreasonable. Furthermore, many airlines charge hefty cancellation fees - often more than the original cost of the ticket - and thus customers are forced to pay other unanticipated and unadvertised fees. For instance, given the choice between a $25 carry-on fee or a $250 cancellation fee (plus the inconvenience and cost of booking another ticket), the vast majority of customers have little choice but the former (even if it did not exist at the time the ticket was purchased).

The solution to these problems is to codify a minimum definition of what must be included in a ticket price. This way, airlines cannot surprise customers with what effectively constitutes a price increase, at a time where customers do not have the power to resist or decline the unwanted cost. Airlines may still charge additional fees for services outside of the minimum definition, but would be liable for severe penalties for changing the price of those basic services - as they so often do today.",,,,,,,

Here's a thought, lower the taxes on the tickets and have the prices broken down so people know what they are paying for and then totaled at the bottom.

I was dismayed and discouraged by the complexity involved when trying to compare prices. The fee disclosures are mercurial, especially when using a third party booking service. It took at least 5 hours of laborious, tedious processes and even then I was not confident that I had all the information I really needed. Sure enough, I did not. The seat assignments made on the booking agency website was fictional and I had to make a phone call to the airline to purchase the now deemed add-on feature of what used to be customary; i.e. assigned seats. The current situation is a consumer nightmare.

Taxes are an intrinsic part of an airfare; they cannot be avoided. Listing them makes it possible to accurately assess the true ticket cost.  Ancillary fees need to be listed because more and more accepted services of a common carrier are being converted to fees for service fees,  and they are an ever increasing proportion of ticket costs.  Moreover,  if these fees are not included, competition is hindered: airlines that provide for services such as checked bags, and even a bag of peanuts, are out at a disadvantage.

If I've paid $650 for a ticket and I'm going to be on a plane for more than 4 hours it seems fair to hope for a small complimentary snack, and if I knew, for instance, that a ticket on Delta was slightly more expensive but included a meal I would be willing to pay more to have the cost of the meal wrapped up in the ticket.

In addition to transparency of pricing in advertising, they should be forced to CLEARLY list their flights by cost on their websites. As it is, they pretend that you can shop by cost, but once you choose a price and go to buy the ticket you are suddenly forced to wade through ALL of the flight options again and decide based on flight time. Then you wait to find out how much it costs. The final cost is NEVER the low cost you initially chose. They purposely confuse and change the routes until you forget where you were going in the first place. Eventually you just click and pray that you made the right choice. And that's when they start hitting you with the ""added"" costs. No other industry gets away with this subterfuge...AND the airlines have the right to keep your money even if they don't provide the service. The whole thing is a racket.

2) Airlines have threatened that any potential rule change will incase costs that they will have to ""pass along to the consumer""  -    Airlines should be required to itemize and prove how and in what ways the rule change will incase their costs and an INDEPENDENT body should decide whether it's appropriate to pass these costs along to the consumer.
3)  Ban preferential ranking of carrier flights 
4)  Message to the A4A:  The USG does not currently tell other industries how to sell their products b/c those industries have not crossed the line that has been crossed by the airline industry.  All industry is driven by profit only and requires check & balance from time to time.

These items could be increased to include a larger snack, headphones and a second nonalcoholic beverage on flights of 4+ hours.  Finally, long haul flights should also include a number of meals corresponding to the time spent on the plane (one every four hours) a pillow, and a blanket.

Any attempt by the airlines to propose that consumers want ""bare"" fares, so they can be knowledgeable (and appalled) when their $250 ticket balloons to $300, is like saying that I want my grocery store to stop showing vegetable prices that include shipping costs, so that I could have the ""opportunity"" to more fully understand the global agricultural system.

If the price of the fair doesn't include a seat assignment, what does that even mean? Are you not guaranteed a seat at all? Maybe there is a standard definition of it, but my mother didn't understand what it meant when she flew to visit me two weeks ago, and she paid the extra $9 for a seat assignment out of fear that she might end up bumped from the flight because she didn't have a seat assignment. 
If the airline advertises a fair, I think it's ok for them to list the base price separately, but they should also have to list the taxes and fees in the same size font in the same visual field (e.g., $59 + $15 in taxes and fees, not $59 and then have the taxes and fees listed in small print at the bottom of the page). If it's impossible to regulate to this level of detail, then they should have to include the taxes and fees in the price they advertise. I understand the airline's argument that other industries don't have to do this, but other industries aren't charging us fees for a seat assignment or to bring another bag with us--so if the airlines are going to nickle and dime what is pretty much a captive audience (we have no choice but to fly some places), our government has the right to regulate them differently on our behalf.",,,,,,,

However, it is difficult to find a consistently low fare or even the same route from one month to another these days, as there seems to be constant turmoil in the formula, most often with rising prices for more limited flight choices and longer flying times.

This way the airlines cannot advertise prices that are false and the government taxes and fees are clearly presented to the consumer. 

Establishing the standard might be time consuming but it's necessary for consumer protection and fair competition between retailers. Allowing airlines to charge a fee for every service will eventually undermine consumer confidence in the industry and make oversight a total mess.

If weight is important, then they should charge overweight people more for their tickets.  
Why is more weight ok for first class passengers? Just because you are rich you can carry more weight?
It is misleading to assert that weight is the factor in charging baggage fees. 
So, let's put people and their luggage on a scale and charge accordingly... I think that would at least be more fair.

Transparency is essential.  Yes spell out the price of ticket, fees, baggage, meals etc. all up front and let the passenger decide which airline to fly.
Also they should show the rating of the airline - stars, just like restaurants or other establishments on Yelp.  Travelers are not idiots.  We need information in order to make decisions that suit our pockets and our desires.
Regulations are essential in this out of control capitalistic system.  It is a fallacy to believe that companies will regulate themselves... we all saw what happened to the banks and the economy when we allowed that to happen.  They simply don't give a foot about people. It is all about their PROFITS.  We need to regulate and make them follow the rules.  Their tendency is to band together and screw us all by becoming monopolies.  We need to unite to make them tow the line.  After all without passengers they would go bust. ..... but...",,,,,,,

I tried to change the time of my flight with spirit, but if you cancel or change your flight you get none of your money back. All of the hidden fees that spirit had absolutely turned me off and I will NEVER fly spirit again. Had they put a more realistic price on their website I would have had no problem, but at every turn there were more fees and taxes and fees, totaling about 75$. 
So even if this does not pass, I would recommend airlines adopt a more transparent full ticket price that shows a breakdown of taxes and fees at the end. You may fool the consumer once, but you may also lose all of their future business.

It is necessary for me as a consumer to understand the true cost of travel while searching for airfares, including being able to easily understand fees for checked bags and other common or essential services and amenities, in order to make real comparisons while shopping for airline tickets. It would be preferable for this information to be reported and shown standardized data formats in order for computer APIs to be built from the information, but requiring airlines to publish the true cost of travel is a big step in the right direction. It is important personal budgeting, timeliness, and fairness to understand the true cost of travel before starting the purchasing process with an airline. 

While I endorse and support the proposal, I would ask that DOT take steps to mitigate unforeseen problems. For instance, by requiring airlines to reveal fees for a carry-on item and advance seat assignment, airlines that do not currently charge fees for those services may find it easier or in their interest to charge more for those services because of the reporting requirements.

At the bottom of the list, in LARGE print should be the sum of all the required costs, fees, and taxes, etc. along with the total cost of any selected options, and finally the grand total.


I think DOT should also look into the use of computer algorithms used to sell tickets based on the number of views, etc.  It is frustrating that ticket prices for the same route and same airline will change in a matter of minutes as you hunt for the best price.

Airline pricing and selling policies are immoral and outrageous.  How can a traveler making an informed choice about a flight when ancillary fees for fundamental aspects of the flight have obscenely large prices affixed to them?  

You should also include regulations prohibiting the adjusting of prices for a specific person based on cookies and/or data obtained from data-mining done by the airline.  Adjusting prices for a person based on their search history, previous websites visited, or frequency of previous or planned future travel must be prohibited. 

Stronger regulations are required for a industry interested in providing the most minimal possible service while extracting the most possible cash.  Anyone who has flown an international airline knows that U.S. airlines offer inferior service more expensively than their peers.

Don't let the airlines water these regulations down.  Consumers should receive this basic protections and guarantees that they are seeing all possible information and options when they are trying to book flights.",,,,,,,

By attempting to divorce the base ticket price from fees and taxes, they are removing transparency from the process. Such fractured and incomplete pricing will just confuse the issue and break the functionality of all the sites that find the lowest prices. 

It seems clear that the airlines would like to muddy the waters and make finding a ticket a longer and more difficult process. By showing lower than realistic pricing they create expectations and desires in their potential customer base, and create an artificial psychological ""need"" to buy a particular product. This ""need"" would tend to influence the buyer to discount additional fees and taxes, because they now have a desire that wants to be gratified, and there is now an incentive to gloss over the additional cost in the final decision process. What I see here is a somewhat underhanded anti-consumer move that would make things harder for everyone.

Every other country in the world does. But unless we have regulations to force business to include tax in their prices, no one will do it.

I am a software engineer and I know how easy it is to implement.  IT does not have to expensive, in fact such information is available to the executives of these airlines thru big data and business intelligence software.

Good information is essential in free markets.  Airlines prefer not to have to show these items because then they will have to compete on price.  Today they can hide all these costs and spring it on the consumer when they are at the airport and have chance to an alternative flight.

These rules should over time help to reduce fare for consumers and I would argue that in a free market that is what should happen.  Congress should support free market policies and the need for transparency and better information for consumers and citizens.",,,,,,,

Consumers should not be surprised by fees and taxes, after seeing a smaller ""fare"" price.  That is a deceptive practice.  A fare price is not the cost to fly.  We are all aware that after 9/11, consumers have to pay a security fee.  Further, there is not a set amount that a consumer could easily add to the cost to determine the full fare price.  This was an argument the airlines used- that a restaurant may only advertise that the meal costs $9.99.  However, consumers know the sales tax amount.  And not may flights can be had for $9.99.  Consumers do not know all the additional fees of an airline ticket.  We do not know what the airlines intend to charge this week for baggage.  We do not know if there are special fees for the airport.  Consumers should be able to make decisions on the full fare.  Airlines have the option to break out the fare during a purchase so consumers are better informed of the actual costs to fly.  However, I do not see where airlines ever show the cost of baggage.  That usually entails a person scouring their website for the fee.  And really, how many people fly without a bag these days?  Not many.  Please do not allow airlines to try to confuse consumers with a potential price.

It's like walking into a car dealership and sitting down with the sales manager wondering if you can get out with a price that's close to what you thought you agreed to when you sat down in the first place.  I HATE the thought of adding regulations to business but now that I hear that airlines want to do away with reporting taxes and fees up front, I say bring it on.  There should be transparency in the purchase.  I don't agree that a checked bag should be included with every ticket, but I do think that a carry-on or two should be allowed to allow for everyone who is going to hand carry their laptop or an overnight bag or a diaper bag with them.  If folks want or need to check baggage, so be it--but price it clearly and fairly with decent weight restrictions, etc.  

If they want to charge for snacks or blankets or movies, that's fine too.  Just be straight up about it. Seat assignments costing extra?  I think that's a rip-off and a time waster, but again, clear and up front and it's fine.  Just let me make a knowledgeable choice about it.   Whether it's rumor or reality, charging for things like using the restroom is a flat-out no in my mind. What next? Insert a quarter to get your oxygen mask to drop down in an emergency?  

Last, in terms of agents and search engines, I agree that it should be transparent about which carriers a company represents.  ",,,,,,,

There are pros and cons to this:

Pros: shows the true cost allocated to different sources; informs consumers

Cons: reduces the ability of the free market to do its job, using price and features as a mechanism for choice

One has to balance the pros and cons in each and every case. For example, when you go to a restaurant you know that taxes and extra fees (tips, for example) are standard. Therefore, it is possible to compare prices and you end up getting the best of both, i.e., transparency and a free market.

When an industry purposefully complicates billing to disrupt the free market, that tears at the fabric of our economy. Imagine, for example, walking into a grocery store and each product had a price. However, when you go the checkout a 'shipping' fee was added to your box of cereal (and it is different for each cereal), and a container fee, and a cart fee, and a markup for the wholesaler fee, and… you get the picture. The point of separating items is to clarify the situation, not obfuscate it. If this bill is allowed through, it sends a clear message to other industries that they are not allowed to weaken an important aspect of our market. 

The argument used by airline associations, i.e., that others do the same, is valid. But the slippery slope only really starts to function when you actually accept it and apply the unusual case to the usual. Better to stop it here, and look at other places (such as telecom) that also egregiously work to harm consumers.

I realize I'm not an American. But being from Canada, many of the flights I take are across the border and your pricing policies have a dramatic effect on what I see, and how I purchase.

What are they smoking? 

The DOT must require fares to be universally defined [e.g. guaranteed seat [not a specific seat], one carry-on bag of specific size and weight, two pieces of luggage of specific size and weight] and to include all local, state and federal taxes. That way, consumers can compare prices in the marketplace without having to sleuth the details of fees, taxes, and specific provisions of the basic fare to make a reasoned comparison. If airlines are worried that consumers won't know the level of taxation in the ticket if that amount is added to the basic fare, they can, and I believe several do, itemize the tax amounts on the ticket and/or boarding pass [this is all computer-based and simple to do]. Luring consumers through the turn-style with a luridly low basic fare, and then smacking them with a torrent of additional taxes and fees once committed, is plain deception.

The disclosure of code-sharing would be good because a lot of confusion arises for consumers when one thinks one is flying one airline and they have no records about it, because one is actually on a code share with another.  Indeed the seamless flow of information between airlines participating in code-shares leaves a great deal to be desired in the 21st century.
Information about the contractual relations of a ticket sales entity with specific carriers should indeed be disclosed so that the consumer is alerted to the possibility that other carriers could also be explored for more favorable conditions.
The possibility to hold an offered fare for 24 hours would be beneficial to consumers (to allow for further research) and not unreasonably penalize ticket agents or airlines.
It is absolutely necessary that ALL costs associated with a trip be disclosed when a ticket is offered for sale.  The airlines protest that taxes and fees vary widely around the globe and hence should not be disclosed.  But to have the consumer bear the burden of discovering the differences, which the airlines know in advance, is an unreasonable demand on their part. This information is standard in the EU and will cause the airlines no trouble to provide in the USA.
I would greet the codification of a standard flight package including airfare, taxes, fees, seat, carry-on baggage, hygiene amenities (i.e. - WCs).  That should be the basic minimum in every package sold. Detailed information about checked luggage, meals, entertainment, arrangements for children and infants as well as handicapped individuals (which according to ADA, must be without extra charge) should be available at the point of sale, so that a comfortable trip can be tailored to the needs of each traveler without financial surprises.",,,,,,,

By attempting to divorce the base ticket price from fees and taxes, they are removing transparency from the process. Such fractured and incomplete pricing will just confuse the issue and break the functionality of all the sites that find the lowest prices. 

Additionally, I am told that repeatedly searching for a fare for a particular route can increase the price of the ticket - that there are algorithms that detect more popular searches and jack up the prices of those tickets. So not having all the information at hand the first time around can cost consumers more. 

It seems clear that the airlines would like to muddy the waters and make finding a ticket a longer, more difficult, and more expensive process. By showing lower than realistic pricing they create expectations and desires in their potential customer base, and create an artificial psychological ""need"" to buy a particular product. This ""need"" would tend to influence the buyer to be less deterred by additional fees, taxes, and price increases, because they now have a desire that wants to be gratified, providing an incentive to gloss over the additional cost in the final decision process. What I see here is a somewhat underhanded anti-consumer move that would make things harder for everyone.

I wholeheartedly support the spirit of the proposed rule. The aviation industry indulges in wanton abuses of consumers wherever possible.

This has been evidence to me by the fuel surcharges and continual desire to itemize every remaining aspect of a commercial airline flight into a line item purchase. I do not mind paying for a flight, but I do detest the manner in which this occurs.

I welcome a sense of continuity and consistency, which the proposed rule appears to provide. If I had a fair and objective notion of how often an air carrier lost luggage or overbooked flights, I would likely travel by air more. I say this because I would be able to prepare in a fair and reasonable manner. Perhaps the dispatch of my luggage by means of USPS if I found that an air carrier was reliable in all aspects save their luggage handling.

As it stands, air travel is a chore. An uncomfortable means to an end. I welcome and applaud the efforts by the Department of Transportation.

Sincerely,
Harlan Kanoa N Sheppard",,,,,,,

Good information is essential in free markets. Airlines prefer not to have to show these items because then they will have to compete on price. Today they can hide all these costs and spring it on the consumer when they are at the airport and have chance to an alternative flight.

These rules should over time help to reduce fare for consumers and I would argue that in a free market that is what should happen. Congress should support free market policies and the need for transparency and better information for consumers and citizens.",,,,,,,

(The additional .9 cent add-on still annoys me, though.)

If someone wants to show how much of the total cost of an airfare is due to taxes, it could be accomplished by listing the fare as ""$289, including $63 in taxes and fees"".  That accomplishes the obvious aim of the Republican bill of raising taxpayer ire, while still allowing the consumer to compare prices without the use of a calculator and a law library. 

Excluding taxes from the listed airfare is anything but transparent and would further erode consumers' ability to make informed purchase decisions.

If we were willing to repeal that, I'd be a bit more willing to buy into their argument; however, as stands they are a heavily subsidized industry that is providing a less and less reliable product without full disclosure to consumers. This rule will greatly help in at least the last part - full disclosure, and hopefully encourage better products. Flying consistently overseas, if it were not for Fly America, I'd never fly another U.S. flag carrier - their service is awful relative to other airlines.

Any recent MBA/Statistics graduate would be able to provide greater information on the financial benefits to flyers than all of the N/As that appear.  It would be in the billions of dollars.  Also in the summary table of Monetized Costs and Monetized Benefits it would be very helpful if the dollar quantities would be given.  Is this millions?  Hundreds of millions?  Billions?  Every properly prepared income statement and balance sheet that I've ever looked at tells me the number of $zeros I should be adding.

Having worked with OMB for a number of years, all I can add is that allowing this type of sloppiness to be published tells me that the quality of gov't analysts has seriously deteriorated for this to get by both DOT and OMB.

Recently I was disappointed to find that getting a regular coach non premium assigned seat was going to cost me extra.  I was stunned as I was traveling with someone and just getting the two of us, a seat side by side, was going to cost me extra.

Time and time again I find that the airline gate agent will request that passengers relinquish their overhead carryon bag because they do not have enough space in the overhead bins. Having so many individuals go through TSA screening with these carryon bags slows the entire process down.  It would be better to allow at least one bag to be included with your ticket at no extra charge, this would, in all likely hood, reduce this request by the gate agent.  Having to carry this bag to the plane and then relinquish it, is a big waste of time and energy for all.  

At a minimum my ticket should include an assigned seat and one piece of checked luggage.  

Then I venture that carryon luggage would not stress the system so much

2) Customers should be assigned a total weight allowance including all baggage and their own weight (ex. 250 pounds total) with perhaps more allowance for men than women based on gender differences.  Prices for weight would go up incrementally per pound over the allowance. With the high cost of fuel there is no reason why thinner customers should have to foot the bill for those who are heavier.

This comment pertains only to the issue of ""transparent"" airline ticket prices.  

I fully support your proposed rule changes!  The current airline practice of hiding fees from the consumer amounts to bait and switch.  It is so frustrating to purchase an airline ticket that I do everything I can to avoid flying, even if the alternatives cost more.  Spending a couple of hours on the computer trying to find out what a ticket costs, and ending up in tears with frustration, is not worth it.  My husband and I choose the train or our car.  Forget flying!  

Please adopt these rule changes.  They would be a wonderful improvement from the current shyster-techniques allowed.

For example, seat reservation fees. Reserving any open seat, should not cost extra. Charging for carry-on bags is another nuisance fee and is purely a revenue generation fee.

Of course all ""scheduled"" air carriers/air taxi operators should have to report delays. Further, regional carriers that supply regional flying to legacy carriers under a codeshare agreement should have this information reported or posted two fold. For example, SkyWest Airlines overall ontime dependability will be one measure, however, when they operate flights for UA, there should be a breakdown of flights operated by legacy UA as well as their regional partners, therefore the SkyWest data would further be used to solidify UA's overall ontime dependability. I feel that is fair since regional carriers' contracts have stipulations for ontime dependability, and if necessary, the legacy carrier may exert pressure or make changes within its power to mitigate these delays. For example, if SkyWest has a heavy departure bank at ORD where they may have 20 aircraft departing within a 20 min period, UA may decide to split that bank up, thus relieving the pressure on their own ramp/passenger service employees, the ramp tower as well as air traffic control.

As far as tickets are concerned, I have always believed that additional fees should be disclosed at time of booking. LCCs as well as their European counterparts, which I understand the DOT doesn't exert any oversight to, have been charging for crazy necessities such as boarding passes, if you don't print these at home yourself. If you have a ticket to fly, you should never have to pay for a boarding pass, as you're required to have one to proceed through the TSA checkpoint. I believe the DOT should, if in their power, also guarantee some necessities that should not be charged fees for. Definitely no fees for boarding passes. When examining ancillary fees, I know for a fact, a carrier will charge a change fee, for example, of $50 for a rebooking/ticket exchange. On top of that fee, they will charge $10 more as a document issuance fee. That $10 fee is now intolerable. How can you charge a fee in order to pay another fee? If you're charging the $50 fee, there should only be that fee. Again, something that should be banned. All baggage, seat selection and meal information should be published on a summary page before a ticket purchase is finalized. If people don't read it, that's their fault, but at least it was fair game since the information was presented ahead of time. Finally, fare aggregator sites that may not encompass all available options, should indicate that. For example, if Travelocity doesn't offer Southwest Airlines or Jetblue fares, it should have a blanket statement that other carriers may exist who aren't sold through this channel. It's up to the traveling public if they would like to continue searching for options. Further, the checkout page that's shown before a ticket purchase is finalized should be standardized. Just like we went to standardized forms for and rules for mortgage closings, it may aid in providing the same level of opportunity to the consumer. You will probably have other comments that help you determine what should be included on such a page/form, but it would be a start to keeping them honest.",,,,,,,

In the DOT Notice, it notes that ""the Enforcement Office has investigated a 
number of incidents where passengers complained that airlines or ticket agents would not honor tickets that had been paid for in full because the sellers of the air transportation erroneously let them book flights for less than the actual value"".

What is ""less than actual value""? What is the actual value and how is it determined and who determines it? How did the DOT determine this statement to be true? Furthermore, if the airlines can allow someone to book a flight, and then follow it up with a confirmation, why should they be then able to claim it was ""less than the actual value"" and cancel the ticket?

399.88 is perfectly reasonable as is. First, the airline should be careful (as any company or individual should) about what fares/offers it is posting and even if it is not careful in what it offers, it shouldn't send out a confirmation if it isn't truly confirming what is it offering. 399.88 gives customers sound and valid protections by 399.88 in its current form and further, the airline is protected in two stages as well given that 399.88 allows an airline to cancel after purchase (but before confirmation). Why weaken the consumer protections when the airlines already have two opportunities to avoid whatever issue this is. If airlines can claim ""less than actual value"", what good is any ticket purchased. Further, does a blog post or a message board that calls a sale fare a mistake or ""below value"" make it so? This is a very slippery slope.

I urge the DOT to keep 399.88 as is written. Airlines are earning record profits and mistakes seem few and far between. There is no urgent or compelling reason to attack consumer protections so that the airlines can be negligent in their business practice. As noted, the protections for both airline and consumer are already sound and reasonable. If the airline doesn't want to sell a certain ticket - they shouldn't sell it. And if an airline sells a ticket by mistake - they shouldn't confirm it. It is as simple as that.

Additionally, when a customer makes a mistake (date off by a day) and notices it 25 hours later the airline gets to keep their money (all reasonably priced fares are non-refundable) and charge an extortionate change fee to correct it (hundreds of dollars, often more than the ticket is worth).

Is DOT in the business of determining minimum prices for each and every route originating or terminating in the United States?  I do not believe that is within DOT's purview under any relevant legislation since deregulation of airfares several decades ago.  And since minimum fares on a route by route basis are not in DOT's purview, by what standard would DOT judge the difference between a low and a 'mistake' fare?  More importantly, how would a consumer be expected to know whether what air travel providers are voluntarily publishing as their prices are real or could be changed per the airlines' wishes?

The average consumer needs DOT's protection as currently provided by the requirements to publish a clear all-in price and to honor it.  No one makes an airline publish a 'mistake' fare.  If airlines get to pick and choose when to honor prices, or the DOT implicitly maintains minimum prices for them, it is the consumer that DOT is supposed to protect who loses.  The same consumer who relied on having purchased a low fare to make other travel arrangements that have non-refundable prices.  The same consumer who is slapped with huge change fees most of the time if they change their mind about having accepted a fare, with no opportunity to say ""Oops, 'mistake' purchase!""  ",,,,,,,

You can not possibly have a standard price for things and then claim when someone purchases the item below what you consider to be the standard price without some form of collusion on pricing and inherently inferentially ANTITRUST.

You can’t possibly say that XYZ route should cost a minimum of ABC and anyone who buys it below that figure “should have known” that this fare was a mistake without inherently participating in collusion to set minimum prices in a market. Free markets do not operate that way. Free markets are free for sellers to offer their product at an asking price and buyers are free to either accept or deny their offer. When a seller makes an offer that after a buyer purchases it they deem to have been too low, it is expressly against all good logic and valid legal interpretation to then allow that party to simply nullify their commitment because they have now deemed their initial offer to be in error.

That would be like someone listing a home for sale with a realtor. And then when a party purchased the home, showing up at closing claiming well I never meant to offer it for that price. I was mistaken. Or like an auto dealer publishing in the paper a unit for 10,000 and then when someone showed up cash in hand, the dealer then saying well we meant to say it was 12,000.

Incorrect, and yes people try this stuff all the time but the BUYER Is not responsible for the publishing of the offer, THE SELLER Is. All offers in terms of how much the fare costs are solely within the discretion and control of the SELLER. If the buyer accepts the seller’s offer, it’s simple contract. The Seller is obliged to follow through with the agreement.

There is absolutely no bad faith involved in this in any way whatsoever. No one has intentionally gone into the seller’s system and forced them to publish a low offer. No one has defrauded or deceived the seller of anything in order to get their products under false pretense. Airlines are free to force people to buy tickets with no refund and recourse and consumers are not permitted to seek the lowest fare. Absurd

This is the most repugnant nonsense I’ve seen in print in the past 10-15 years and we’ve been forced to live through a heck of a whole lot especially since 2008.",,,,,,,

Currently, 11 legacy carriers offer a $3 fare from OSL to FLL. Is that a mistake? Is it a consorted industry wide effort to destroy an new competitor?
On another route to Europe most airlines offered a $186 fare. LX offered a fare of $1860. Was that a mistake? 
The point is that the logic and rationale that go into an airfare is incomprehensible to the average consumer. And, a consumer should not have to comprehend WHY an airline offered a certain fare. It unfairly shifts the burden from the corporation to the consumer to seek to understand what was mindset, intend and strategy by the airline. Airlines publish 1000+ of fares per day  with wildly variying fare rules to maximize their profitability. And that is perfectly okay. However, if that leads to complications, confusion and the publication of mistake fares, the airlines need to be held accountable for that, not the consumer. The airlines could just publish one fare for NYC-LHR, but they choose not to. Today, LX offers eighty (80) different coach class fares from NYC-LHR. Some business class fares are less than a coach class fare. Is that a mistake? It cannot be the consumers responsibility to ensure that the airline meant to publish that fare. 
Mistake fares, exceptionally low fares or just great fares MUST be honored by the airlines. Airlines should not be able to pick and choose which fare they will honor in the end. Airlines have the choice of simplifying their revenue management systems or increase their checks and balances to ensure only fares are published that the airlines intended to be published.

Regarding your clarification of ""within, to or from the USA"". It is very apparent to me that if I fly FRA-DFW-MEX, that I am flying TO the USA and then on to Mexico. That is evidenced by the simply fact that all US immigration, custom etc laws and rules apply to me. Mexico has no problem with travellers bringing in meat or fruit. Try telling the US Customs officer to not worry about the 10 oranges and 4 steaks since I am going to Mexico next. If the flight touches US soil, DOT rules should apply. Airlines should not get a free pass to skirt the law because of the amount of time a traveller spends in the USA. FAA rules apply to all flights into the USA, even if that plane leaves for another country afterwards. It is a slipperly slope when you try to carve out that certain itineraries do not apply to DOT protection because the passenger spends less than 24 hours in the USA. There is simply no logical basis for that argument, other than it allows airlines to skirt their responsibility. ",,,,,,,

Standardization of current database technology should easily allow the public to make exact dollar-for-dollar comparisons for airfares between the various carriers.

The concept of consumers being responsible in any way for airline pricing, or being expected to adjudicate INTENT on behalf of the seller, is ridiculous and contrary to the principles of consumer protection in the US.  

Merchants are not entitled under consumer protection law to revisit their own published prices after products have been sold and to void the sale and repossess the product at some indeterminate time after sale.  Imagine what would happen if a store promoted iPads, sold them, then later claimed the sales were void because their own sticker price was now considered ""too low"" by the same management that originally set those prices, and the merchant then repossessed the items forcibly.  

This is exactly why consumer protection laws exist and the intent of the 14.CFR 399.88a regulation, to provide similar protection for consumers of air travel, is to be lauded.  It makes air travel more consistent with other forms of consumer protection. 

We, the consumers, are held to account for terms and conditions when buying tickets and we are not authorized to decide after purchase that the price was too high and to void the ticket, obtain a full refund, and then begin again.  We recognize and accept these conditions and the carriers do too, by implementing differential pricing for changeable tickets.  If such changeability has market value, and the carriers expect their conditions to be respected and enforced, then why should consumers be treated differently?

Also, the idea of any free speech activity being measured or taken into account as determinative of ""good"" or ""bad"" faith is despicable.  It violates the principles behind the First Amendment and should have no place in agency rulemaking in the United States.  What is this - Switzerland, or a fascist thought-speech control regime?

This concern smells of airline lobbying/pressure behind the scenes.   

The 24 hour rule does need to be clarified and seems reasonable to make the definition of ""air travel to/from/within"" the United States clearer for consumers and air carriers.

The mess in Canada with respect to a so-called mistake fare, where the Canadian Transportation Agency backtracked on an earlier enforcement decision for seven complainants and then ruled against more than eighty further complainants on the same issue shows what happens when carriers lobby governments and where definitions are unclear and can be influenced by commercial pressure.

Sellers of air transportation are in full control of their pricing and distribution channels.  Why the DoT invokes a problematic concept of ""bad faith"" is disturbing and will undermine all rulemaking of this type.  But, if ""bad faith"" is to be raised, let's address the bad faith of those who set prices, sell product, and then renege on it.  This conduct is more clearly ""bad faith"" than those who purchase the offered product and should be regulated - which it currently is, by the 399.88a ruling as it stands.

The DoT is to be congratulated on taking this seriously in the first instance, as shown by recent FOIA-released correspondence regarding recent fares from RGN and the predictable responses of airline legal and corporate representatives protesting the ruling.

A doctrine of absolute liability for published fares is critical.  It maintains incentives for carriers to monitor and manage their own product pricing without relying on a government agency to bail them out from what they can later call their own ""mistakes"" and prevents arbitrary renegings that undermine market and contract reliability.  Any fare that is published and purchased is a valid fare and should be treated and protected as such.  Any change that undermines this principle will be opposed by consumers.  Copy to Congressional representative.

Under no circumstances should any airline be able to cancel tickets booked by consumers on so-called ""mistake fares"". The airlines send their fares and rules to the Airline Tariff Publishing Company. ATPCO distributes the fares to all sellers of airline tickets. There are checks and balances, in both airlines and ATPCO to prevent mistakes from happening. But, mistakes still happen frequently. The airlines are ultimately responsible for auditing their own fares. To label ""blogs"" as bad actors and then to further label consumers as acting in ""bad faith"", is gross misrepresentation. When a consumer makes a mistake in purchasing an airline ticket, he/she has to pay all kinds of penalties for the error. To release airlines from providing transportation to a consumer who purchased the ticket in ""good faith"", is giving all the power in the marketplace to the airlines. Consumer advice is always that ""the buyers should be wary"", but airlines need to be wary of their possible errors, as well.",,,,,,,

1) Regarding #5 Customer Service Commitments: a) These should be expanded to airlines as well as defined by the 0.5% of domestic scheduled passenger revenue threshold as these requirements would equally impact both Ticketing Agents and Carriers. b) The definition of a ""prompt refund"" should be specifically less than 7 calendar days for all Carriers and Ticket Agents that sell/provide flights that depart from or arrive within the US and less than 14 calendar days for exclusively international flights. c) In coordination with item proposed rule #1, I believe that the DOT should also include a provision that if the Carrier or Ticketing Agent fails to honor the commitment of any paid Ancillary Fee they are required to refund the passenger based upon the ""prompt refund"" definition. This would include if a paid first checked bag is delayed more than 2 hours in its delivery to a customer.

My view point of this comes from the fact that I about two years ago needed to book a last minute ticket in economy on a US carrier. The fare was refundable and I needed that flexibility because I was waiting to hear back from a friend on a medical issue. The carrier debited by credit card immediately, then about two hours later my friend contacted me back and said my travel wasn't immediately required and it took them almost three calendar weeks to refund my credit card.

I have read too many friends on Facebook that have posted that they paid the carrier's Ancillary Fee for a bag and then the carrier ""lost"" the bag in transit. In most cases, from what I have heard, the airlines refuse to refund the passengers for the service they offered when something happens this is unfair when baggage delivery should be a core competency of an airline and they exchange cash to act as a delivery service.

2) Regarding #9 Post-Purchase Price Increases: a) I would expand this to also include a prohibition from increasing the price for preferred seating and any services provided for free or included in the price of the fare. Seating, baggage and other commitments the airlines have promised are core services that consumers expect to remain the same once a ticket is purchased.

3) Also Regarding #9: Airlines and their agents have complete control over the pricing of tickets and how they are distributed to consumers, the fare rules and all conditions that consumers must agree to (with no negotiation). Compared to the number of fares posted mistakes are genuinely rare. Most of the airlines that errors impacts are extremely large organizations that can afford to put in sound audit and invest in IT systems/tools that would help prevent issues. In this case, the DOT should let the free market with the current consumer protections act as an incentive to the airlines, GDS's and ticketing agents to improve their processes and systems.

3) Also Regarding #9: I agree that all forms of travel should be included as some airlines offer continuing service via code shares on trains and cruises. However, I very much disagree with the additional inclusion that a time period of a connection or stopover that is ""24 hours or longer"". The United States is unique in that we require all passengers of transportation to clear customs and immigration. Therefore, it is complete possible and something that I have used to leave London in the morning, schedule a meeting in New York for the afternoon and then have a connecting flight to South America on the same ticket the next morning because the airlines allow a 24 hours ""connection"" so that I can spend almost a full day in the US. Depending on how the fare basis codes work out the LHR-JFK and JFK-EZE could be completely separate fares and for convenience of both the airline and myself I have those flights on one ticket number. By adding the ""24 hour"" words to this rule the DOT is limiting the protection of a ticket where I very clearly have to enter the United States, have one or multiple segments that could have me passing through the United States several times, and creates complexity around a very simple concept at its core. If a ticket is issued and a passenger travels within, to or from the United States any and all carriers and travel agents must honor fare of that booked itinerary.

As an example last year I booked one ticket GIG-DFW-CDG-JFK / surface break & one week stay / LAX-NRT-DFW-CDG-JFK-EZE. The ticket had multiple fare components. Without a straight forward rule, ""air transportation within, to, or from the United States"" how would I know what parts of the ticket the Ticketing Agent or Carrier could change?

However, revising Section 399.88 to allow the airlines more leeway in dealing with what they consider ""mistake fares"" sounds like a terrible idea--a disservice to American consumers of air transportation.  When passengers make mistakes in their fare booking, they are penalized.  Carriers impose hefty charges when passengers change their minds with regards to travel dates and routing.  And carriers always have the upper hand, even in the case of incredibly low fares.  Information on booking classes, which is not always available at the time of purchase, is extremely complicated and varies from one airline to another.  Sometimes the airlines or travel agencies (both online and offline) do not even let passengers know the precise fare booking class before they actually make the purchase.  With seemingly low fares, carriers can impose most severe restrictions on changes.  They may not award full mileage either.  Whatever a passenger may gain in terms of fare discount, he or she may lose in terms of restriction and mileage.  This is asymmetrical information advantage.  Yet it is the current system we are all operating under.

Now if the Department decides to loosen the restrictions on the part of the airlines and allow them to freely cancel ""mistake fare"" based on their determination that the fare has been purchased in ""bad faith,"" the already not-so-level playing field will be further tilted towards favoring the airlines.  When an airline decides that it could sell a fare for much higher than it did due to unexpectedly high market demand, it could freely cancel the transaction after determining that the consumer might have got the information from an online posting and therefore knew in advance what they were getting into--a ""bad faith"" attempt.  It will be then the passengers' burden to prove that they did not.  This is extremely unfair and unenforceable and will weaken consumer's protection.

In addition, in today's bewildering air fare market, how would an average consumer be able to know if the low fare is mistaken or real?  Many airlines routinely advertise free fares while charging a hefty sum for taxes and fees.  It would be an extreme and unreasonable burden for the consumers know the difference.

The so-called mistake fares are exceedingly rare.  Have the airlines submitted to the Department credible data on actual loss of revenues due to mistake fares?  If they do, would the Department make these data available to the public for examination?  Until such data is available, there are no compelling arguments to weaken consumer protection under Section 399.88.  Airlines are required to honor their end of the contract, just like millions of passengers are once the transactions are completed.  I just don't see how revising Section 399.88 would benefit the consumers or reducing risks for the airlines.",,,,,,,

At a minimum, advertised and offered fares for all transportation mean should include all mandatory fees and taxes.  This includes airport fees, federal, state and local taxes, plus any other charge that the traveler must pay to be moved from point A to point B.

Additionally, I believe that the airline, bus or train operator should include in the price of the ticket the ability to check one piece of luggage, weighing no more than 50 pounds, a personal item and one carry on bag.  It pains me to have to say so but I also believe that access to restrooms should be included.

There is little effective competition in the airline industry at this point, with the American government having allowed the entire industry to merge into--effectively--3 major US airlines. The public has no leverage anymore, airlines can do more or less whatever they want and they have been doing so.

This regulation is a good first step, but doesn't entirely solve the problem. There have been ""incredible shrinking bag sizes"" at major airlines as recently as last week. It's not particularly meaningful to require that a checked bag be included if the bag can be 2 inches in total size and weigh one ounce. Most recently, allowable carry-on bag sizes have shrunk. As a starting point, I would like the DOT to define a standardized allowable size and weight, both more generous than the current new 9"" maximum dimensions which seem designed to force everyone to either buy new carry-on luggage or pay massive fines.

Another problem is that airlines charge so much for extra bags that it's often much cheaper to buy a second seat and use the baggage allowance from that. However, airlines won't actually allow you to do this. When you consider that a single overweight extra bag checked on a United international flight can cost $600, this violates the basic principle of fair dealing. It is a huge problem for musicians like me who must travel with musical equipment and are given no choice but to either pay these ludicrous fees. I have had to turn down performances abroad because of unaffordable bag fees, even though a second ticket would have been affordable.

Finally, I would like to propose that the checked baggage allowance should be one bag on domestic flights, and two bags on international flights as was previously offered by all major airlines. Such limited airline baggage allowances are harming the US economy by discouraging foreign visitors from shopping here and this needs to stop immediately.",,,,,,,

They could be broken down into standard categories, i.e., ""certain charges and fees"", ""optional charges"", ""taxes"", etc. The categories should be standard so that any air traveler can readily compare what services will cost on different airlines for a given set of services. Travelers should not have to dig through multiple web pages in different formats to piece this information together. It is a tremendous waste of time for each flight a traveler makes and an enormous waste of national effort when all travelers are considered.

The airlines may balk, but American industry espouses free enterprise and the competitive market when it suits them and as any student of elementary economics knows, the ability to compare prices for similar goods and services is a pillar of competition. Regulation is necessary because free competition is not in the best financial interest of the airlines but is required to make this market fair.

I appreciate that some carriers display ""% on-time"" stats by segment on their web sites. I would think that data could be rolled for the airline as a whole.

I hope the airlines understand, and have pride, that consumer loyality is brand related and they would do their best to ensure that all real or perceived entities of the brand are deserving of the brands name.

Had I not followed my gut feeling and inquired upon landing at Heathrow, I would not have had time to make my flight the next day.  It took hours of my time, which was hours lost exploring London.

2.  On time is a joke.  They have extended flight times by 25 % to 50%, so they can arrive on time even when they leave late.  Customers have no way of verifying reasons given for delays.

3.  The airlines overbook and then threaten not to have the flight take off - even if it means being late - unless enough people volunteer to be bumped so they can avoid federal mandated passenger compensation for involuntary bumping of passengers. 

4.  The airlines try to get you to wait 24 hours before filing a lost luggage complaint to make their numbers look good.  I was asked to wait around 4 to 6 hours before filing a complaint, which I promptly refused.

Most passengers are misled by the current report because when they buy a mainline ticket the only airline they associate that ticket with is the mainline name.  Rarely do they look further into their trip to find out if any or all of their trip is flown by a regional partner of that mainline airline.

I believe mainline airlines would show more concern and do more to improve their regional partners (which they have a lot of control over because they often are they employers of ground service personnel and gate agents) performance numbers if all the numbers are combined.

The regional partners performance is an internal metric that mainline needs to monitor and make improvements. Mainline airlines are motivated to do more if their partners' numbers are included within theirs and reported to the public as such.",,,,,,,

They provide no information other than the flight is expected within the hour last month my wife's flight was cancelled after waiting 8 hours before they finally told no flight that evening, will be the next day. no form os apology was offered. NONE  

Last week in purchasing a ticket for her to fly to Phoenix my pricing changed after I hit the purchase button They are a group of ornery people

Check their web site and try purchasing a ticket  The add ons are confusing and I believe meant to be deceptive

They do not respond to written complaints  They are brutal  I am willing to discuss  my experiences of them with you

The air carriers operating in the United States are taking taking consumers for a 'ride'. Fees adn chargers are poorly defined and is subject to last minute interpretation. I would like the following to be addressed as well:
1. Multiple stop bookings: When a consumer wants to make a multiple stop booking, most outlets (website that are either carrier owned or third party) does not give you option to do this. The consumer is forced to call the carrier and in most cases are charged 'phone reservation charges'. These charges should be abolished. Why should a consumer pay more because the carrier has not provided the option?
2. Canceling for medical reasons: If a consumer has to cancel for medical reasons, he/she should be given full refund of the ticket. Do we want a situation where a medically unfit traveler starts a journey and fall ill along the way? If one were to think logically it is obvious that a lot of people do this when they are medically unfit, just because they stand a risk of losing the ticket money. Give consumers the option to get a full refund for medically required cancellations (either for themselves or caused by medical conditions for immediate family) and it will save money and headaches for everyone around.
3. Consumers should be given one fare whether it is on the web or through a phone reservation system. Many carriers operating in the US including international carriers (specifically Etihad, Emirates, Singapore Airways) have one fare posted on their website. When the consumer calls the reservation folks to make a reservation they quote a different fare with the explanation that 'they are not able to see the web fares'. This makes a significant difference in pricing and should NOT be permitted. The reason consumers are forced to call is mainly due to issues with names and how to enter them in the reservation system, particularly for passengers who culturally do not go by First Name, Middle Name, Last Name format.",,,,,,,

I would like to comment point by point: 
1)	Definition of ticket agent – before adding groups to be regulated, DOT should consider that it does not have staff to regulate airlines themselves. I therefore believe that the provisions should primarily deal with airlines responsibility, not that of unattended websites. 
2)	The primary responsibility should be that of the major airlines. Whether GDSs are included or not is less important-they can be added later. The initial regulation should cover the fewest groups to be regulated.It is better to have defined regulations for the major carriers than undefined regulations for many.  
3)	For the above reasons, there is no need to expand the number of airlines to be regulated at this time.
4)	All code share partners information should be provided, both foreign and domestic, if the US airline is selling the ticket. 
5)	I agree completely with point 5.
6)	Where the code share arrangement is detrimental to the air traveler, that should be disclosed. Specifically, if that means that the traveler cannot access information electronically during his code share trip (as is currently the case with at least one major carrier) this should be disclosed. At airline requirement that passengers may communicate ONLY by telephone to access flight information should be disclosed. 
7)	I don’t see the point of this.
8)	This is unclear.I don’t understand what this would mean or how it would be implemented.

I support the department's efforts to require airlines to disclose the true price of an airline ticket.  I am a small business owner and travel 100% by commercial air carrier to service my clients each week.  Having the full price of a ticket, plus an ancillary fees for necessary services, disclosed up front allows me to quickly make an intelligent purchasing decision.  

If I am forced to spend additional time to find the true cost of a ticket, that is time I am not able to devote to my clients, costing my company money.  Aside from salaries, airline travel costs are my second biggest expense.

With the technology available today, there is not an undue burden placed on the airlines to disclose all costs at the initial contact point for buyers.

My issue is with the checked bag fee. Airlines must offer compensation to the traveler if they are over booked, flight canceled, etc. Traveler is also paying a fee for their bags, there should be compensation when the airline fails to meet the standard of checked bags traveling and arriving with the traveler.

I propose the airlines be required to refund the checked bag fee(s) if the checked bag(s) are:
1. Not on the same plane the traveler is on or arrives on another aircraft landing 61 minutes or more after the traveler's flight actual touch down time.
2. Lost or destroyed by the airline.

No refund would be required if: 
1. Bag(s) sent ahead on another flight, waiting for the traveler to arrive. 
2. Bag(s) sent on a later flight to land at the airport under (1) one hour after the traveler's flight arrives. 

Any flight landing 61 minutes or longer after the traveler's flight landed would trigger the automatic refund. Weather or mechanical issues delaying the bags on another flight from meeting the (1) one hour arrival window will not be an excuse to block the refund. All airlines would be required to refund the fee for every bag not on time or arriving with the (1) one hour window. Traveler would fill out a refund slip with the airline's airport baggage office, maintain one copy. May be done electronically at a kiosk with a copy emailed to the traveler.

Refund must go directly to the credit card. Posted within (10) ten working days. Airlines would be prohibited by law to bargain with the traveler, offering them a voucher, coupon, frequent flier miles, or other type of non-cash compensation. By law, cash refund only. Information about the refund required to be printed on the checked bag receipt and viewable during the website process to pay for checked bags. As an incentive to the airline to process the refund with 10 working days, any refund not processed within the time limit automatically doubles.

Too many times I have checked in hours early, had flight delays, yet when I arrive at the baggage carousel, my bag is missing. Later I find out the airline, while having more than enough time to ensure bag was on same flight as me, willfully failed to meet the standard. Hours to the next day it finally shows up at my hotel or home, greatly inconveniencing me. 

Roughly two million bags disappear, arrive late, become damaged, or are stolen every year. Airlines keep the checked bag fee, the traveler is left out. If this fee was returned, @ $25 per bag X 2,000,000 = $50 million dollars. An amount the airlines cannot ignore, baggage fees making the difference between a profitable or not profitable flight. Having every airline refund the checked bag fee would directly affect the airline's bag fee profits, lowering them. Nothing gets a Corporate CEO's attention faster than the company losing money does. Problems would be identified and quickly worked.

It is not only inconvenient, particularly when checking in at airports, but it seems like a bait-and-switch from the airlines. I understand that having to include the fees in the base price will give the appearance of rates going up, but I am certain the vast majority of consumers just want to know what the price is going to be for any service--not just airlines. And the added costs seem like a way to ""game"" the system to no one's benefit but the airlines.

For example, today I searched for a flight from Washington D.C. to Alaska on Kayak.com. I was quoted an $802 fee. When I clicked through to purchase, I was then forced to pay for each seat on each leg of the four-leg journey. There were NO options for seats without additional cost. And it increased the cost of my fare by $179 in the end. I purchased it because it is a work trip and I have to go, but when I submitted a cost estimate to my employer for approval, there is no way to account for those fees unless you go all the way through the booking system--which is a tremendous hassle to the consumer, particularly for professional restrictions on flights costs.

I am fully aware of and comfortable with higher ticket prices on the front end of the purchase, if I can be confident that that is the price I will pay--or very close to--when I hit ""purchase."" The perpetual adding of fees to every facet of airline travel is cumbersome, overly burdensome to the consumer, and never streamlines what is generally a multi-step process.

Thank you for your time on this matter.

This letter is in enthusiastic support of requirements for airlines to disclose fully all ancillary fees when they advertise prices for air travel.

As a person who has traveled frequently for many years, I have been appalled at the trend toward a proliferation of fees, and even more appalled when I face unexpected surprises at the last minute.  

I am retired now, and one aspect of retirement that I had looked forward to was the opportunity to do more personal travel.  But understandably, I have to be even more careful than I was before to compare prices and seek the most cost-effective option for my travel.  This has become increasingly difficult as the number and types of fees increase, especially since it is not always easy even to find out what additional charges may apply and how much they are.   

It seems to me that the only possible reason that airlines want to withhold information on their ancillary fees is in hopes of MISLEADING the public.  Even though we have learned that there are extra fees, they can vary a great deal between airlines, so what looks like a good price for a ticket from one airline might actually turn out to be more expensive than the price the traveler would pay on another airline.  These hidden extra costs are magnified for families traveling together.

It seems to me this is a very simple issue:  honesty in marketing demands full disclosure of additional costs.  If airlines are competing on price, they should compete on the actual price.  Period.

I do realize that there are a lot of ""optional"" services, and not everyone will opt for all the services.  However, some of the services are pretty basic and do apply to many travelers, for example, luggage fees (for both checked and carry-on bags) and fees for preferred seating within a section of the aircraft.  It should not be that difficult to post a basic price and somewhere in the same ad or on the same page, have a list of ""extras"" and their prices.  To me, this is not much different from requirements of pharmaceutical companies to disclose possible side effects of their drugs.  I'm sure the pharma companies didn't want to do that, either.

Therefore, I applaud efforts to change the current airline practices, and want to encourage the Department of Transportation to implement new rules to require that would require the airlines to make it easy for a traveler to know all the additional charges they might incur.  

Sincerely,

Gail H. Marcus

As carriers are already required to allow reservations to be held at the quoted fare without 
payment or cancelled without penalty for at least 24 hours after a reservation is made if the 
reservation is made one week or more prior to a flights departure, the Department is proposing 
to extend this requirement to ticket agents that sell air transportation
_____

I recently booked (via an online travel agent) a ticket for three at a reasonable rate for a return flight to an overseas destination. The online agency didn't support adding a lap-child. I subsequently found out that the airline involved (when adding the infant via their customer service line) charged 25% of the full adult (non promotional) fare, which brought the cost to nearly the same fare as that of my son! If this protection had applied, I would have cancelled the ticket and booked with another carrier, however the fees that were going to be charged washed out any difference in booking with a different carrier and cost me more than $450 in additional unanticipated costs.

The proposal to extend the same protections made to consumers when dealing direct with airlines to travel agents which sell the same tickets make sense, and would make the implementation consistent. I support this extension.",,,,,,,

My comments follow as the Chairman of a large travel management agency focused primarily on business travelers.

Travelers and the general public who rely on the DOT to protect them from unscrupulous airline practices need the DOT to make changes in the ancillary fees proposal in the NPRM. These are absolutely necessary to restore true transparency and the ability for a consumer to do comparison-shopping of the all-in price of air travel alternatives. The DOT needs to put an end to unfair and deceptive practices which the airlines are doing all possible to protect, despite the fact that they harm the consumer.

The DOT must require airlines to allow consumers to pay for their basic ancillary services at the time of ticket purchase through any distribution channels airlines use. Failing this, the consumer is exposed to the GREAT SURPRISE at the airport where the cost of the trip is suddenly much more than s/he thought. Furthermore, even if there is some cumbersome way for the consumer (and particularly the business traveler) to calculate these extra charges separately, having to separate them from the air ticket itself creates a terrible accounting hassle for the traveler and for his company's accounting department.

Given the high percentage of airline tickets purchased through travel agencies, the DOT must ensure that airlines share ancillary information with all of the ticket agents they use, including global distribution systems (GDS), to ensure that the information can be broadly, efficiently and effectively disseminated to travel agencies in a usable format. Requiring airlines to push out this vital price information to travel agencies via the GDSs that issue airlines tickets is the only workable solution.

""Ancillary services"" must be expanded to include priority boarding and change/cancelation fees as well as any bundles that include the basic ancillary services under the rule.

The role of the DOT is to provide that the public, and specifically the consumer of air travel be able to travel safely and securely and be dealt with fairly by the airlines. REQUIRING THAT AIRLINES MAKE IT CLEAR FROM THE OUTSET EXACTLY HOW MUCH A TRIP IS GOING TO COST IS SOMETHING EVERY TRAVELER SHOULD BE ABLE TO RELY ON. And it is the duty of the DOT to see that this is a reality.

Dear Sirs,

As a TMC serving the business community we urge the DoT to review and reconsider all the implications that this proposal will bring to life.
It is vital that airlines show all charges associated with a  booking to allow all TMCs booking for business consumers to make a valid judgement and to be able to directly compare like with like when intending to book travel. Anything but absolute clarity exacerbates the current confusing situation fort everyone. As far as I can see the only entity to benefit from underhand or hidden fees and charges are the people who wish to purposefully maintain this position of subterfuge to their own gain at the total expense of the most important people in this equation - the travel bookers and travelers. It is true that the consumer always pays in the end, but it would be nice for them to know exactly what they are paying to be able to make an informed decision at the point of sale and not when the booking is almost complete (known as drip pricing), when it may to too late to do anything but be sucked into the transaction and make the booking. Airlines must show all fees and associated charges early in the booking cycle to ensure above board clarity. What is fair and equitable about hiding fees until the end of booking?
I hope the DoT will consider it's actions before anything is done and it is too late for the people and indeed the very travelers and bookers of travel who elected them into power.

Many thanks.

In my humble opinion, this rule should be passed without anymore delay. I am an infrequent flier, maybe once or twice a year. After searching and booking online for the cheapest airfare using most of the available sites over many months, it is very upsetting to arrive at baggage check-in and be hit with more costs. Now some airlines are charging a fee for carry-ons too!
The airlines should state all fees and extra costs upfront and on all online formats so the consumer can make an educated decision before purchase. I am a senior citizen and cannot afford the extra, unknown before-hand, expenses imposed on me.

Regarding DOT-OST-2014-0056-0079

Dear Secretary Foxx,

We consumer groups are writing to you to urge the Department to focus on what we consider the core issue in the current airline consumer protections NPRM - the consumers ability to see, compare and buy ancillary fees. Consumers do not want to see this issue delayed again should other portions of the complicated NPRM require more study and analysis.

A robust docket shows that American consumers need and demand price transparency, the ability to comparison shop increasingly complex airline tickets along with fees for ancillary services and the ability to purchase those services wherever airlines choose to sell their tickets.

The solution is simple. The DOTs final rule should ensure that:

 Airline consumers can see the full cost of flying including basic ancillary fees.

 Airline consumers are able to comparison shop across airlines including passenger and flight specific ancillary fees.

 Airline consumers are able to purchase these ancillary products at the same time that they pay for their airfares.

The free market works only when prices are transparent, and consumers have waited long enough.  As you know, the debate on this issue has been exhaustive.

 More than three years of industry studies, government analyses and economic papers.

 Detailed congressional hearings and meetings of the DOT Advisory Committee for Aviation Consumer Protection.

 Newspaper editorials.

 Hundreds of pages of rulemaking comments.

 Tens of thousands of consumer signatures.

 An extraordinary year-long review by the Office of Management and Budget.

We urge DOT to move expeditiously to ensure that ancillary fees are disclosed, searchable and transactable. Consumers have already waited more than three years for this issue to be addressed; we cannot risk further delay.  

Over recent years airlines have made their ancillary fees increasingly complex. Some airlines are even moving to dynamic, real-time pricing for things like carry-on and checked-baggage fees and seat reservations fees. Those airline actions to shroud ancillary fees during the purchasing process have made the buying process unfair and deceptive for consumers attempting to purchase the services they will need on their flights.  

Our organizations are thrilled that DOT has finally, after more than a thousand days, published this rulemaking. Now, we urge the Department to complete its rulemaking with robust requirements for the disclosure and transactability of ancillary fees.

Given the complexity of this rulemaking, consumer groups will understand should DOT require additional time to reflect on the new and important issues that have been added to this rulemaking such as a new definition of what constitutes a travel agent, expanding the pool of airlines reporting operation statistics, customer service plans from ticket agents, transparency of codeshare operations, disclosures of marketed carriers by online travel agencies and screen bias displays.  If so, the DOT could follow its precedent with ancillary fees in the last consumer protection rule and request additional comments on any or all of those topics.

We urge you not to allow the complexity and scope of this NPRM delay the relief consumers have so desperately needed for the last six years since airlines begun aggressively unbundling their products. Consumers have waited long enough to know the full cost of airline travel.

From minimal space to no food (if your connection is late and you didn't pack your own food, you might not eat anything for a good 12 hours!) it's just a nightmare. The ultimate insult, however, are the ridiculous and blatantly greedy new fee policies that have made luggage an optional 'extra.' Seriously? In today's upside down world, everything is for sale, yet it's getting harder and harder to actually know the price for that trip (which is bound to leave you feeling used, abused, and wanting to just smack someone!) before you buy. I can't get my mind around why or how this is happening. Where is the government oversight to reel in this bad behavior? Everything is for sale, it seems. Next, we will need to reserve and pay for bathroom opportunities..

After reading through the long, long, and very wordy PDFs published by you folks, I have my doubts that you get it, but one can hope. It's pretty simple: people are not cattle; they need a little bit of space for comfort and health; when they go far enough that they need to fly they carry a suitcase; they likely started out really early with little sleep and they need food every few hours (but didn't have time to pack a lunch when they got up at 4am, so that rushed late connection means nothing but a tiny bag of nuts because the airline never has enough/any vegetarian stuff to buy); and they need to know how much a ticket for a ride on an airplane will cost, in total,with taxes (really, we know these fees are part of the deal and don't expect a free ride, just a total cost from the folks with the information and software to calculate that). People are cranky these days when they fly, with good reason. It's up to government agencies to keep bad practices from getting completely out of control. Please, end the madness!

For example: carry-on pet fees (for carrier the size of a purse) increased from $50 Rt to $350 on Delta (!!!). When I complained to Delta they responded that their ""marketing department "" had determined the pricing. Meaning it had nothing to do with safety, or spacing concerns - only with how much they can wring out of customers. Paying $350 on top of a $450 ticket (75% added fees???) is frankly insane. 

One checked baggage should be included in the ticket price. Forcing more people into using carry-ons just passes the baggage inspection costs onto the TSA, slows down travel and increases safety concerns.  The airlines should raise ticket prices instead of using back door fees to increase their revenue - it's become abusive. I can only hope actually reads this and investigates.

Re: Docket OST-2014-0056

Dear Secretary Foxx:

As the Department evaluates the pending Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Transparency of Airline Ancillary Fees and Other Consumer Protection Issues, please consider these comments for the record.  

I operate Classic World Travel . We are based in Peachtree City, GA and employ 20 people.  I am writing about the NPRM because many of the proposals will directly affect my business and my employees.  

I am encouraged that the Department is finally taking steps to ensure all aspects of a travelers flight costs  including basic ancillary services  are readily apparent when booking the flight.  The situation today is untenable.  My customers, both corporate and leisure, cant with any certainty calculate the true cost of airfare.  The add-on fees are too complex, dynamic, and changeable from airline to airline to allow for 100% accurate quotes.  The NPRM as contemplated will relieve some of that pressure by mandating that the airlines disclose up front the cost of bags and seat assignments.  

But the Department should do more.  The potential for confusion remains high under the contemplated scenario.  A consumer armed with ancillary services quotes from my agency can still be surprised when he or she checks with the airline and finds out that the price has gone up since the quote or, even worse in the case of seat assignments, the seat he or she wanted is gone.   

If the Department wants to ensure true transparency of airfares, it should require that airlines allow consumers to book ancillary services at the same time he or she books a flight.  This small step will add certainty to the airfare booking process.  Travel distributors like GDSs have the technology to enable these bookings, and the airlines should benefit from an increased volume of ancillary sales.  Its a win-win for the entire travel value chain.  

The other provisions contained in the NPRM pertaining to travel agency mandates should not be enacted.  The Department in its filing has not shown any compelling reason why these proposals should be finalized.  

I oppose extending certain customer service requirements to travel agencies.  The move is unnecessary in large part because there is no problem requiring regulation to solve.   The travel agency community is highly respected and well-liked by its customers.  And in contrast to airlines, I have strong non-regulatory incentives to provide top-quality service to my customers.  Very simply, my customers have a choice of providers they can turn to if they find my service lacking.  An airline customer, on the other hand, is often tied to the airline with no real ability to switch providers.  The Department should allow the travel agent industry to continue to function as it is today and not intercede where it is not needed.  

Finally, the Departments proposals to mandate two different travel agency disclosures are similarly flawed and should be rejected.  

Its hard to understand how a consumer would benefit from the disclosure of incentive payments received by travel agents from airlines.  As noted above, any travel agents first priority is to its client.  Incentives always serve the interest of the client by allowing an agent to provide cheaper service for a flight on a given airline. To force disclosure of incentive payments would only serve to demonize what is otherwise a positive thing for consumers, agents, and airlines.  

Requiring a travel agent to disclose the airlines it does not market is similarly misguided.  Todays consumers understand that not all carriers choose to utilize travel agents to distribute their fares.  In fact, Southwest is currently running an aggressive ad campaign touting that carriers independence from travel agents.  The Department would never require airlines to disclose on their websites that travel agents offer a wider variety of airlines and destinations from which to choose.  It should not require the same of travel agents.  

Thank you for entering these comments into the public record.  

Sincerely,

Daniel D. Solly, CTIE
President

It is already hard enough for a small business (or any business) to succeed in an environment which is increasingly administratively hostile.  It is easy to create regulations with good intentions, but often at that point, any application of common sense ceases.  It is so important for those creating regulations to be very careful to exercise ultimate common sense, knowing that no one from that time forward will exercise any at all.  Please do not create regulations that will be a burden for many and will be a benefit for few.

In the matter of: Docket OST-2014-0056
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
Transparency of Airline Ancillary Fees and Other Consumer Protection Issues  



Comments of JOINT STOCK COMPANY AEROFLOT  RUSSIAN AIRLINES

Please find Aeroflots comments on the U.S. Department of Transportations Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Transparency of Airline Ancillary Fees and Other Consumer Protection Issues 79 Federal Register 29970 (May 23, 2014), hereinafter NPRM.
Aeroflot serves the United States market via gateways:  New York  JFK with 14 flights per week, Los Angeles daily, Washington  IAD up to 3 flights per week, Miami up to four flights per week.  
We have examined the DOTs Proposal and hereby note that Aeroflot would meet difficulties since the Russian legislation does not regulate relations between agents and air carriers in the way the DOTs Notice (NPRM) advises. 
Due to that Aeroflot strongly endorses the comments submitted by the International Air Transport Association on this matter with evidence that the market is already addressing the issues raised by DOT and any intervention by the Department will likely have a negative impact on consumers. 
We urge the Department to either withdraw this rule or, in the alternative, enter into consultations with the industry on a rational timeline to achieve the DOT goals.

Re: Docket OST-2014-0056

Dear Secretary Foxx:

As the Department evaluates the pending Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on Transparency of Airline Ancillary Fees and Other Consumer Protection Issues, please consider these comments for the record.  

I operate Blue Ribbon Business travel International, Inc.  We are based in Edina, MN and employ 23 people.  I am writing about the NPRM because many of the proposals will directly affect my business and my employees.  

I am encouraged that the Department is finally taking steps to ensure all aspects of a travelers flight costs  including basic ancillary services  are readily apparent when booking the flight.  The situation today is untenable.  My customers, both corporate and leisure, cant with any certainty calculate the true cost of airfare.  The add-on fees are too complex, dynamic, and changeable from airline to airline to allow for 100% accurate quotes.  The NPRM as contemplated will relieve some of that pressure by mandating that the airlines disclose up front the cost of bags and seat assignments.  

But the Department should do more.  The potential for confusion remains high under the contemplated scenario.  A consumer armed with ancillary services quotes from my agency can still be surprised when he or she checks with the airline and finds out that the price has gone up since the quote or, even worse in the case of seat assignments, the seat he or she wanted is gone.   

If the Department wants to ensure true transparency of airfares, it should require that airlines allow consumers to book ancillary services at the same time he or she books a flight.  This small step will add certainty to the airfare booking process.  Travel distributors like GDSs have the technology to enable these bookings, and the airlines should benefit from an increased volume of ancillary sales.  Its a win-win for the entire travel value chain.  

The other provisions contained in the NPRM pertaining to travel agency mandates should not be enacted.  The Department in its filing has not shown any compelling reason why these proposals should be finalized.  

I oppose extending certain customer service requirements to travel agencies.  The move is unnecessary in large part because there is no problem requiring regulation to solve.   The travel agency community is highly respected and well-liked by its customers.  And in contrast to airlines, I have strong non-regulatory incentives to provide top-quality service to my customers.  Very simply, my customers have a choice of providers they can turn to if they find my service lacking.  An airline customer, on the other hand, is often tied to the airline with no real ability to switch providers.  The Department should allow the travel agent industry to continue to function as it is today and not intercede where it is not needed.  

Finally, the Departments proposals to mandate two different travel agency disclosures are similarly flawed and should be rejected.  

Its hard to understand how a consumer would benefit from the disclosure of incentive payments received by travel agents from airlines.  As noted above, any travel agents first priority is to its client.  Incentives always serve the interest of the client by allowing an agent to provide cheaper service for a flight on a given airline. To force disclosure of incentive payments would only serve to demonize what is otherwise a positive thing for consumers, agents, and airlines.  

Requiring a travel agent to disclose the airlines it does not market is similarly misguided.  Todays consumers understand that not all carriers choose to utilize travel agents to distribute their fares.  In fact, Southwest is currently running an aggressive ad campaign touting that carriers independence from travel agents.  The Department would never require airlines to disclose on their websites that travel agents offer a wider variety of airlines and destinations from which to choose.  It should not require the same of travel agents.  

Thank you for entering these comments into the public record.

Costs of changing reservations, etc., are often shown only after a reservation has been made and credit card information supplied.

If passengers or those making trip reservations for passengers are able to truly make an informed choice, then information about ancillary costs and taxes must be available for comparison.   Otherwise the regulating agency is essentially permitting--really authorizing or legalizing the airlines to repeatedly commit fraud.   Because they are authorized to conceal information about the true actual and potential (if someone must change his/her reservation) costs of the contract to be a passenger (maybe, since the airlines reserves the right to cancel the flight or bump the person off the filght) on a specific commercial airline flight.    Given that the airline is free to cancel the flight and do little to get the passenger to his/her destination (unlike, for instance, Amtrak, which makes a far bigger effort to assist passengers in the event of train delays, cancellations, etc.) with little or no cost to the airline, at the least passengers should be able to determine ALL the costs of the flight at the time they are looking at different flights with different airlines.

I believe it's an appropriate exercise of power for a federal agency to ensure that members of the public can make a fully informed choice on a purchase of a ticket.   If it were not for the rise of corporate ""speech"" I don't think there'd even be any question that full disclosure at the time a potential passenger checks flight schedules is required.  It's as if I couldn't find out the full cost of a pair of jeans prior to checkout, the retailer could refuse to list some of the price on the price tag of the jeans.   ",,,,,,,

When the baggage fees were introduced many years ago, the public was given the impression they were temporary and implemented to offset the fuel prices at the time.

On a related note, how about a new pricing strategy?  Specifically, the airlines charge the customers based on the total weight--their body weight plus their baggage weight.  Why should I pay the same fare when another consumer that weighs twice as much as me requires more fuel to be burned from Point A to Point B?  After all, this is the premise behind toll roads and our shipping companies (USPS, UPS, FedEx, etc). ",,,,,,,

Re: Docket OST-2014-0056

Dear Secretary Foxx:

The International Airline Passengers Association (IAPA) supports the recent DOT efforts to enhance passenger protections with respect to fare and pricing transparency.  The Association believes that the inclusion of the total airline ticket price in advertising and availability displays has been fair and beneficial to air travel consumers, particularly our global membership of frequent flyers.  The inclusion of additional ancillary charges as proposed by the current NPRM (DOT-OST-2014-0056) is essential and IAPA joins with other travel and consumer organizations in urging the DOT to move forward with requiring the disclosure by airlines of all ancillary fee information applicable to an itinerary through all distribution channels.  The availability of fee information through all sales channels is essential to promoting fair competitive practices.  A fare shopper seeking the price of an itinerary through a travel agent, online or otherwise, should have access to the same information on ancillary services and costs as would be available directly through an airline. 
 
IAPA agrees with the Business Travel Coalition and its supporters in the industry in comment ID DOT-OST-2014-0056-0079 that ancillary fees be transactable through all channels where an airlines fares are made available for purchase.  While the Association respects the concerns of airlines and acknowledges the complex variables that influence the final cost of ancillary services (such as frequent flyer status), IAPA believes that existing technical infrastructure should permit the distribution and sale of at least the essential ancillary services as defined by the NPRM.   Concerns over the variables that could alter or waive the costs of certain ancillary services could be mitigated by allowing voluntary information to be input (frequent flyer number) that would validate the final cost of such services for that particular customer.   Lacking the ability to buy such services at the time of booking, passengers should then be protected from price increases by basing the cost of ancillary services on the date of ticket issue.  This could make purchasing these services more complex instead of easier.   

IAPA urges the Department to continue the move toward greater pricing transparency while encouraging all parties to work toward an acceptable standardization across all sales channels.  The goal should not be to place an undue burden on either industry or consumer, but to ensure that the purchase of air travel is transparent and equitable.

Sincerely,

Dear Secretary Foxx:

I operate Sky Bird Travel.  We have offices across the US that employ over 130 people.  I am writing about the NPRM because many of the proposals will directly affect my business and my employees.

Very simply, my customers have a choice of providers they can turn to if they find my service lacking.  An airline customer, on the other hand, is often tied to the airline with no real ability to switch providers.  Lastly, travel agents are simply agents of the airlines.  When an airline makes a mistake, the airline has the ability to rectify the problem immediately, especially when the traveler is enroute.  Agents are at the mercy of the airline to provide similar levels of service as the airlines are the final decision makers as to what the agent can offer back to the traveler.  The Department should allow the travel agent industry to continue to function as it is today and not intercede where it is not needed.  

Finally, the Departments proposals to mandate two different travel agency disclosures are similarly flawed and should be rejected.  

Its hard to understand how a consumer would benefit from the disclosure of incentive payments received by travel agents from airlines.  Many travel agents work on a tiered and/or market share structure when it comes to incentives.  Agencies are again at the mercy of the airlines accounting reports to know if they have achieved the targets to earn incentives.  There are with such incentives, revenue goals, market share goals, as well as deductions from marketing carrier revenue versus operating carrier revenue that are all taken into consideration for an agency to know what incentive they have earned.  Airlines do not have same accounting programs and rely on several different entities (ARC, BSP, GDS, MIDT) to provide data which they internalize and then present to agencies.  This information provided to agencies is not uniformed nor is it presented by all carriers at the same time.  By virtue of the above it is impossible for any agency to disclose to a customer incentive payments received by an airline.

Requiring a travel agent to disclose the airlines it does not market is similarly misguided.  Todays consumers understand that not all carriers choose to utilize travel agents to distribute their fares.  In fact, Southwest is currently running an aggressive ad campaign touting that carriers independence from travel agents.  The Department would never require airlines to disclose on their websites that travel agents offer a wider variety of airlines and destinations from which to choose.

Any fees that will be charged in connection with booking an airline ticket should be clearly stated to the customer before payment is requested, whether the customer books the ticket directly with an airline, through a travel agent, or through a travel website. 

In addition, DOT should establish new minimum standards for seat width, pitch, and leg room to avoid seriously compromising the health and safety of consumers. These minimum standards would allow customers enough room to brace for impact by bending over in their seats in the case of an emergency situation. They would also ensure that on long-distance flights, all passengers would have enough leg room to reduce the risk of deep-vein thrombosis and other medical conditions that have been on the increase since the airlines began reducing the seat width, pitch, and amount of leg room for economy seats.",,,,,,,

I'm a consumer. How can I make an intelligent decision to purchase an airline ticket from one airline or another without knowing the complete cost of a ticket? Furthermore, the full breakdown of the costs of the ticket ought to be disclosed such that the consumer knows exactly what he/she is purchasing. Airlines and the DOT have an obligation to provide this basic information. Consumers (or would be passengers) have a right to this information. As a consumer I'm not asking for the airlines to bend over backwards, only to make available information regarding the complete costs of the product/services they're trying to sell me prior to making the actual purchase. The availability of such information shouldn't scare the airlines or the consumer. If I need to get from A to B and the distance and/or time to travel by land is too great then there's only one option left: air travel. Trust me. People don't choose air travel as their first choice these days because of the caustic environment that is air travel. Worst case scenario with disclosing complete pricing data upfront, as I envision it, is consumers getting upset about how much a particular fee or tax is and complaining to their congressman, and airline profits decreasing as an unbundled ""option"" is taxed.

Bottom line. The DOT and airlines have an obligation to disclose this data upfront to consumers. Consumers have a right to easily access complete pricing data prior to making a purchase. It's not a sexy issue like human rights, but then again have you seen how people are treated upon boarding an aircraft? It's often better to be a piece of luggage on an aircraft.

CEI is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public interest organization that focuses on regulatory policy from a market-oriented perspective. 

In our view, this latest action by the Department of Transportation (Department) is part of a broader attempt to expand its unfair and deceptive practices (UDP) authority under 49 U.S.C.  41712 in a manner contrary to Congress intent in passing the Airline Deregulation Act. Bolstering this contention is the Departments admission that the projected costs of the revised rules governing airline ancillary fees greatly outweigh its projected benefits.

In addition, we believe the Departments proposed regulation of ancillary fees reflects a status quo bias that will adversely affect airline competition and consumer welfare.

As two introductory general comments, first, we would like to highlight that we do not see any basis for the DOT to propose to regulate the interaction between the air carrier and the carriers customer and its proposals in the NPRM that would insert the department in the relationship between air carriers and intermediaries (ATPCO, GDSs). Second, the cost benefit analysis in the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for this rule is, according to our opinion, and in support to IATAs and A4As opinions and analysis, is highly negative and most areas of the proposed regulation have no quantifiable benefits; hence, following such analysis, we do not see the justification behind introducing such a rulemaking where the benefits do not justify the cost.

We  work diligently with our major carrier partners to improve baggage handling and on time performance through a variety of practices including  coordinating minimum connecting times and subscribing to baggage tracing systems, but do not have the  sophisticated database mechanisms to aggregate  and report this data.    As we carry a  small number of customers, further extending the number of reporting carriers would create a significant burden and expense to small businesses like ourselves while providing little benefit to the public.    

We  also believe that it  would not be beneficial to require existing reporting carriers  to include data  of their  codeshare partner airlines  in their reports.    The current model of calculating an airlines on time performance compares the number of delayed flights to the number of operated flights.    Including smaller regional flights into the statistics of major carriers would skew the report by giving equal weight  to flights that carry significantly fewer passengers.   Thus, the reports would not reflect the experience of the majority of customers traveling on the reporting carrier flights.

In particular, the 24 hour rule should be enforced on all travel agents selling tickets that originate from the United States.

If travel agents and agencies are not required to honor the 24 hour rule, this ends up being a loop hole in the system.  Airlines will be able to sell tickets through the travel agencies without having to honor the 24 hour rule. The travel agency would sell the ticket for a discount and in turn protect the airline from having to honor the 24 hour rule

Without enforcing this, we are essentially creating double standards for Air line reservations and customers will not be able to exercise their rights

What is not fair or reasonable however, is maintaining $200 as the same benchmark for determinations to be made that was first put in place nearly 25 years ago.  A moderate indexing for inflation of 1.5% per year since 1990 would set the subsidy cap today around $285.  Given the significant challenges the airline industry has and continues to face since that time with the cost of fuel and recent pilot training requirements, an increase of the per passenger subsidy cap to $300 would be appropriate.  In addition, annual indexing for inflation should be implemented if enforcement of this subsidy cap is to continue in a fair and equitable manner.  ",,,,,,,

Jet Fuel fuel was about half what it is today.  Crew salaries and benefits were also almost half what they are today. The math does not work for smaller communities that are struggling to match 1999 passenger limits with 8/9 passenger airplanes and 6 dollar jet fuel. 

If The department of Transportation wants to reform the Essential Air Service Program, it should start with direct over-site. In most cases when a community is given a carrier to provide daily service to a major airline hub, that community has no input on how the carrier serves their city. In many cases what is promised and sometimes in the service agreement is never followed by the air service provider. Then the city is punished because the airline has not met the passenger subsidy cap.

The amount of the passenger subsidy cap needs to be updated if DOT plans to enforce it.  Fifteen years later.  ",,,,,,,

Verret, Executive Director",,,,,"On July 2, 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced the intention of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to approve the following information collection: Voluntary Near Miss Reporting in Oil and Gas Operations on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  The Offshore Operators Committee(OOC)provides the following comments for consideration on this information collection request. 

OOC is an organization of some 61 producing companies and 80 service providers to the industry who conduct essentially all of the OCS oil and gas exploration and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico. Comments submitted on behalf of OOC are submitted without prejudice to any members right to have or express different or opposing views.   We have encouraged all of our members to submit comments on the proposal.  The oil and natural gas industry supports 9.8 million U.S. jobs and 8 percent of the U.S. economy, delivering $86 million a day in revenue to our government. 

Our members and associates recognize that offshore operations must be conducted safely and in a manner that protects the environment.  The offshore industry in the Gulf of Mexico has a long history of safe operations that have advanced the energy security of our nation, and the energy resources in the region are also crucial to our nations economy.

We believe that the BTS effort on near miss reporting should be done from a company standpoint following established criteria rather than allowing for uncontrolled reporting from individuals. Collection of data at the company level will provide more consistent and focused reporting data.  We note that the  BSEE regulations at 30 CFR 250.193 currently provide an avenue for individual employees to report unsafe conditions and activities.  Allowing for individuals to report near misses under the BTS proposal may result in duplicative and unfocused reports that will create unhelpful burdens for the agency.
