Memorandum re Ryukyus 1  1. The United States does not itself desire to acquire sovereignty, for the reason, among other things, that the United States seeks scrupulously to conform to its January 1, 1942 declaration that it seeks no aggrandizement, territorial or other.  2. If Japan renounces sovereignty in favor of no one, this would create a chaotic international situation, particularly if, as is possible, the United Nations does not approve the trusteeship agreement we shall propose. It might then be claimed  a) that sovereignty was vested in the inhabitants, who could hereafter assert, perhaps with United Nations backing, a right to oust the United States; b) that the victors in the war over Japan, including the U.S.S.R., have an inchoate right to sovereignty of these islands renounced by Japan in favor of no one in particular; c) that the United Nations is entitled to deal, in its own way, with the islands and their inhabitants; d) that the United States has, by a subterfuge, actually acquired the sovereignty.

The United States also has an interest in [Page 620]Taiwan which we got away from Japan. Japan has merely renounced sovereignty over Taiwan which has not been disposed of by the peace treaty and not ceded to anyone. Consequently the United States also could assert a legal claim until Taiwan is disposed of by some means. We cannot, therefore, admit that the disposition of Taiwan is merely an internal problem. https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v02/d322  While the juridical status of Taiwan is in limbo, certainly the Chinese Nationalists have the best right to it of anyone.

I am writing to enthusiastically endorse Boutique Airs EAS proposal for Massena Airport. Boutique Air, SkyWest, and Cape Air have pitched their offers to the Massena Town Council, who overwhelmingly supported the current carrier, Boutique Air, due to its reliability and convenience, proposed route and schedule, and enplanements over the past 2 years. However, I understand there is pressure from the Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Authority to select SkyWest instead. My reasons for endorsing Massena Town Councils selection are listed below.

1. Boutique Air currently provides three daily round-trip flights to Boston. I live in Potsdam, NY with my wife and 2 daughters, while I work in Cambridge, MA and fly this route weekly- leaving Massena Monday morning and returning Friday evening.

a. The flights are in comfortable pressurized cabins, leave Massena on-time regularly, there are no change or cancellation fees, and customer service is excellent.

b. The schedule enables a 9 AM Massena departure and a same day 9 PM return, especially useful to patients receiving treatment in Boston.

c. Boutique Air has a United Airlines code-share and interline agreement and uses a United Airlines gate at Boston-Logan International Airport, which enables seamless ticket reservations and transfers from Massena to hundreds of domestic and foreign destinations. Early next year Boutique Air will have an interline agreement with American Airlines (which uses the same Logan Airport terminal) as well.

d. Boutique Air rents a hangar at Massena airport and plans on setting up a Massena maintenance facility, which will significantly contribute to its economy.

2. SkyWests proposal is contingent upon their bids approved for Massena and Ogdensburg airports to Washington Dulles and Chicago OHare.

a. If SkyWest is selected for both airports, there will be no flights from New Yorks North Country to Boston, which will be a tremendous loss to the community. These flights are used by hundreds of passengers weekly, including patients to Boston hospitals and medical centers, students to the numerous colleges and universities in Boston and Cambridge, and professionals to the thriving New England metropolis.

b. A 6:30 pm Chicago OHare arrival makes it extremely difficult to connect to the desired destination, and a 11:30 pm Massena return would require this small, regional airport to operate until midnight.

c. SkyWest flies 50-seat jets, which, to fly at full capacity, require 100 passengers on average to leave Massena and Ogdensburg daily. This is extremely unlikely, given that current enplanements are 30 passengers per day on average. The remaining 70 seats are likely to be filled by travelers from Canada, and it seems unreasonable that our federal tax dollars should subsidize Canadian passengers.

d. The proposed SkyWest schedule is extremely inconvenient for Massena passengers. All Massena departures will stop in Ogdensburg, where passengers will likely have to deplane, re-board, before flying to Dulles or OHare. Massena passengers will have an hour added to all flights except those returning from Dulles. It would be far for efficient to make a 20-minute drive to Ogdensburg, where direct flights are available to both hubs, rendering Massena EAS worthless.

The SkyWest proposal appears to be a $ 6 million federal subsidy for Ogdensburg Essential Air Service to Washington and Chicago, with a Massena shuttle service. I strongly feel Boutique Air is best for Massena and implore you to heed the recommendation of Massenas elected officials and select Boutique Air for Massenas Essential Air Service.

Thank you for your consideration and should you have further questions or need more details, please do not hesitate to contact me by email at firazmoh@gmail.com or on my cell phone at 917-392-9043.

Sincerely,
Firaz Mohideen,

If Skywest is awarded the contract it could become the airline servicing Massena. Boutique Air flies from Massena to Boston and Cape Air flies from Ogdensburg to Albany & Boston. EAS is for passengers in small towns not for giving our Canadians flights to Dulles and Chicago. 

Massena board has selected Boutique Air and submitted the proposal to DOT.

If Skywest is selected, then both Boutique Air to Boston flights and Cape Air flights from Ogdensburg to Albany will all be gone. You will have a big plane with a very limited flight schedule--and an especially poor schedule in Massena.

The Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Authority, which runs the airport in Ogdensburg, endorsed SkyWest's proposal of single daily roundtrip flights to Chicago and Washington D.C. from both airports. 
The Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Authority did not consult with the Massena Town Board, nor did they hear from any of the airlines proposing service (Boutique, Cape Air). Despite their best intentions, this is not a very good way to go about such an important matter, the process was in stark contrast to the public meetings that took place in Massena with all the airlines. 
Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Authority Director Wade Davis, five presidents of colleges and universities in the North Country, including St. Lawrence University President William L. Fox and Clarkson University President Anthony G. Collins, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, State Senator Patty Ritchie, and Assemblywoman Addie Jenne  (Jenne later withdrew her support) all expressed their support for SkyWest in letters to the DOT. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority is throwing its weight behind an Ogdensburg Bridge and Port Authority
The Ogdensburg Airport Board have also asked for a variety of organizations and schools to support them in this decision, but they don't seem to have talked with many (or any) of the passengers (that's you!). This is not good especially since they held zero public meetings about this nor did they invite the airlines to come and give public presentations the way that Massena did. It is not clear that anyone other than the Ogdensburg Port Authority (Airport) had much of a say in their recommendation.

Essential Air Service program has now become another political, business self-center-interest instead of being selected for and by the North Country residents- the users of this service. Another example of political and businesses pushing for Skywest without considering the North Country community for input. All of these groups of people and politicians are saying what is good for the North Country; Massena Village board did due diligence by hold public meetings and the public voiced that Boutique was the best choice for Massena. 

Congress established the Essential Air Service (EAS) program to ensure that small communities that were served by certificated air carriers before deregulation would continue to receive scheduled passenger service, with subsidies if necessary.

Often times when we have new workers arrive from South Africa we have them fly into Alliance. 
We have been extremely pleased with Boutiques services since they arrived in Alliance. 
They are reliable airline carrier with an impeccable safety record. 
The pilots are always polite and do a fabulous job with customer service. 
Not to mention that the planes are incredibly comfortable and their safety records are much higher than the out of production Metroliners used by Denver Air Connection. 
It also seems that Shawn Simpson, the CEO of Boutique, is willing to work with the city on whichever flight schedule accommodates citizens the best. I admire Shawns humility in expressing that he made a mistake in the past with communication and would like an opportunity to do a better job going forward.

My family and I are residents of Grant County, NE. I am writing to strongly voice my support of keeping Boutique Air in service at the Alliance, NE airport, especially considering new safety concerns that have come to light with alternative Key Lime Air and the Metroliner airplanes they operate. 

Since 2001, the Metroliner aircraft has had 10x the accidents, 5x the fatal accidents, and 2.6x the fatalities than the Pilatus aircraft that Boutique Air operates. 

My husband commutes for work often using Boutique Air, and myself and several of my family members who are frequent flyers are so happy that Boutique operates out of Alliance. It is vitally important to small communities such as ours.

However, if the switch was made to Key Lime Air, frankly the drive to Denver is too easy to risk flying on a Metroliner, and I expect we would opt for the safer option of forgoing a flight on Key Lime rather than take the risk. 

Sincerely,

Hannah R.

Hello,

Im writing to express my feelings on switching carriers that fly into the Alliance Airport.  

First & foremost,  Boutique air has some of the safest airplanes among their fleet.  Much safer than the airplanes that will be used if we were to change carriers.  I fly them very often & always feel very safe knowing their fleet is very safe & has the track record to prove it.

Boutique has agreed to change to better accommodate flight schedules.  I am retired so their schedule is fine with me but if they are ready & willing to listen and change their schedules, I think they should be heard.

I was one of their passengers that was affected by their flight schedule problems last year & I was not happy about it, but moving forward, I believe that they have learned by their mistakes & are willing, in the future to communicate better with their customers, if anything like this should happen again.  

I understand that City Counsel did not have the information regarding the safety of Boutiques planes compared to the planes that will be used by the new carrier but now that they do have this very critical information I hope that this change will be considered.

Thank you for your time & consideration on this very important issue.

Sincerely,

Audree Dross",,,,,,,

I am writing to offer my support to keep Boutique Airlines flying in and out of Alliance.

I am a former Alliance native currently living in Kansas City, MO. It is generally a 9 hour drive for me to get to Alliance to see my parents and relatives when I want to visit. I fly to Denver and then take Boutique Air from Denver to Alliance. This has made the trip much shorter and much more enjoyable.

They offer fantastic service, a comfortable flight and I feel very safe when flying with them.

I use the service 2-3 times a year to see my parents who are now in their 80s. With them not able to travel, I am making the trek more often and will be flying even more in the future.

Compared to others, I know I am not an Alliance frequent flyer, but I do know a quality airline and Boutique is one of them. They have an outstanding safety record and with them adding more flights to their schedule in May, it will give me more options for flying out more often. 

I know there is a new airline in the mix for the Alliance regional service. From what I have read, their safety record and aircraft age do not touch Boutique Air's modern planes.

I know you consider many factors when making decisions that affect the city of Alliance. I hope you will also consider those of us who have flown Boutique Air and believe it is the best choice for the city.

Brett Dietrich",,,,,,,

Im writing on concerns to Alliance changing contracts with their airline service provider. Its as if theyve trying to wreck a good thing thats going right now. Did they make any requests to Boutique for the changes they needed made before just tossing them to the curb? Ive flown many times and enjoyed the dependability and consistency/on time departures Boutique has offered over the years. Their customer service is incredible, helpful and friendly and I am fully confident in having my elderly grandpa fly alone with them, knowing if he were to need assistance- the Boutique staff and pilots would be kind, friendly and happy to help.

Im not alone in my desire to keep Boutique Air for the airline of the panhandle. Previous airlines were prohibitive in cost to use and they were not reliable enough to count on for other travel plans and flights out of Denver. 

I appreciate your time and consideration in keeping Boutique Air as the air service provider for Alliance Nebraska.",,,,,,,

I have flown with Boutique Air many times since they have started servicing the Alliance area and I have never had any problems or concerns about me and my luggage getting to Denver where I usually fly to.  The ticket agents and pilots are always helpful, friendly and always considerate.  Flight times are for the most part very easy to work with connecting flights.  I flew Great Lakes when they were servicing Alliance and several times had my flight cancelled because the plane wasn't ""full"".  On one of my flights with Boutique I was the only passenger!   I've only had one flight cancelled by Boutique due to mechanical problems and the agents were very instrumental in getting the 5 of us that were to fly that afternoon to Denver by renting us a van with a full tank of gas.  
     I am concerned about the safety record of Denver Air Coaches type of plane they operate.  I know at anytime things can go wrong and accidents happen, but I like the fact that Boutique has a very safe safety record!
     My connecting flights in Denver are with American and Boutique has a baggage agreement with them and United.  I understand that Denver Air only has an agreement with United, which means going to baggage claim, rechecking your luggage and then going back through security for your connecting flight.  Most of my flights are to visit my daughter and her family and I fly American every time and will continue to do so in the future.
     I thank you for taking the time to read my comments.  I just wanted to let you know I'll be flying with Boutique as long as they service our surrounding area.    ",,,,,,,

We knew it would be broken by the time we landed but there was nothing we could do. I literally watched as they treated the thing that I cherish the most be destroyed right in front of my eyes. Our chairs are our life line, you disrespect our chair and thats like disrespecting us. If the average person purchased a Audi or some other really expensive car and than had a valley park it, and that valley took it and crashed it into a wall or even took car keys and keyed the thing, would that driver not be held responsible? Yes they would, so why arent airlines being held responsible when they destroy medical equipment?

The agency has access to direct reporting of consumer complaints through phone, mail, hotline or online through the Aviation Consumer Protection Division.

Airline customers also can make disability related complaints directly to air carrier customer service representatives, airline management or ADA compliance through the Department of Justice.

The DOT should consider including discrimination reports on the platforms available now and relieve the airlines from this redundant reporting.  In most cases, an alleged discrimination report will not be created on the day of travel rather some time later.  Airline staff really have no inkling that a complaint will be filed until after the fact which generally will be some time later.

The current reporting method is outdated, redundant and does not seem to be effective.

The arguments against this amendment are fundamentally incorrect. Firstly, the health effects of electronic cigarettes can not be examined nor studied until they manifest in the population. E-cig use is relatively new, studies do not have a large enough sample size to determine their health effects like with cigarettes. Moreover, the batteries of e-cigarettes have proven unreliable and faulty. They pose the risk of an in-flight explosion which should automatically justify their banning on aircraft. 
The fact that you even believe that it's just water vapor that you're inhaling proves your sheer idiocy. Last time I checked, water vapor on its own doesn't have enough integrity to come out in a billowing cloud. 
I am appalled by the self-righteous stubbornness of the opponents to this amendment. Like dude, just chew some nicotine gum or put on a patch. Face the reality that you are nursing a substance addiction and that it does not justify exposing a whole cabin to the smell of your artificial strawberry-scented ""water vapor"".

There are multiple chemicals identified in e-cigarette aerosol. Secondhand e-cigarette aerosol contains nicotine, hazardous ultra-fine particles, volatile organic compounds, and other chemicals, some of which are carcinogenic (e.g., formaldehyde, metals like cadmium, lead, & nickel, and nitrosamine). The battery powered nicotine delivery systems pose fire risk and are required to follow specific instructions if to be present in the aircraft. Release of these chemicals could potentially be harmful to infants and young children and also adults with respiratory problems travelling in the confined space such as an aircraft.

I agree we should amend the existing airline smoking rule to explicitly ban the use of electronic cigarettes on all aircraft in scheduled passenger interstate, intrastate and foreign air transportation. I do believe that e-cigarettes should be classified as one kind of cigarettes and it would definitely bring up the same potential health and passenger comfort concerns that they pose in an aircraft. In this sense, we should ban the usage of e-cigarettes just like what we did in the smoking prohibition in intrastate and interstate air transportation. I suggest adding e-cigarettes as hazardous items in the security check, just like lighters and liquids.

Re: DOT-OST-2017-0028 ""Maintenance of and Access to Records Pertaining to Individuals""

        Our names are Daniel Garcia & Lamar Bennett. We are second year law students at the City University of New York and we write today to express our concern regarding proposed rule DOTOST20170028 Maintenance of and Access to Records Pertaining to Individuals which exempts the Aviation Consumer Complaint Application Online System (""ACCAOLS"") from disclosure of individualized records. We oppose the proposed rule because of the impediments it will place on potential litigants right to discovery pursuant Federal Rule of Civil Procedure rule 26(a)(1)(A)(2).  	
	Our concern is grounded in three main points. First, the rule does nothing in service of 
the public interest (the DOTs ability to conduct investigations), while it does seriously 
undermine the interests of private citizens (the right to information). Second, the proposed 
rule will have an adverse effect on private litigants seeking redress for any harm committed
by airlines or DOT employees. And third, the mechanisms to determine whether dissemination 
of information is appropriate are discretionary.  
	The purpose of this rule is articulated thusly: to protect records compiled for investigations and inquiries into alleged Federal civil rights and consumer protection misconduct by airlines and air travel companies. This proposed rule does not adequately public interest (the DOT investigative needs) and private interests (freedom of information) because the DOT can arbitrarily rule that nearly all the information collected is part of an ongoing criminal or regulatory investigation. As you state: The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, requires that agencies tell the public when they maintain information about a person in a file that may be retrieved to that person's name, this compiling of information does not necessarily mean that the information is being stored for the, exclusive, purposes of investigations or litigation. The publication of such information would not hinder the departments ability to conduct ongoing investigations in any substantial way. 
	Exempting the publication of these records would have two adverse consequences for the public: first, it would prevent individuals from being informed consumers, and using their wallet to affect conduct of private business; and second, it would put potential litigants at a disadvantage in determining patterns of impermissible behavior.      
	This proposed rule could seriously disadvantage airline passengers who are seeking to file discrimination claims against airlines pursuant to Civil Rights Act, as airlines fall into the classification of public accommodations, and, in rare instances, Bivens actions against DOT employees. For instance, a plaintiff or group of plaintiffs who are alleging racial discrimination would need information about the consumer complaints to establish that the airline has a pattern or practice of racially profiling people.  These examples show that there is a serious risk that this proposed rule will undermine the right to discovery, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 26 because material information on the ACCAOLS will be exempt to disclosure.
	The proposed rule allows for ways around the exemption, whether through a waiver by the OST or individualized FOIA requests. This contention does little to quell our concerns about an individual right to access their information under the Privacy Act. That standard seems ephemeral at best and may be applied differently from one instance to another. This vagueness could mean little, if any, information would be disclosed because of this exemption from publication and the DOT may refuse to disclose information that may highlight embarrassing patterns of discrimination by airlines or DOT employees. 

	For all the reasons stated above, we respectfully oppose this proposed rule in its current form.

Sincerely,
Daniel Garcia & Lamar Bennett

Dear Mr. Moss:

In response to Docket Number DOT-OST-2017-0069-2855 published in the Tuesday, Feb. 5, 2019 Federal Register / Vol. 84, No. 24 (https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DOT-OST-2017-0069-2855 ) requesting Public Participation and Request for Comments, King County Metro Superintendent of Transit Fleet Contract Management Group Mr. Steve Policar and I respectfully re-submit our comments originally submitted to FTA on September 7, 2017 regarding FTAs Buy America Handbook (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/17/2017-00873/buy-america-handbook-conducting-pre-award-and-post-delivery-audits-for-rolling-stock-procurements ).

Based upon our combined 50+ years experience conducting and/or directly supporting 185+ Buy America audits, Mr. Policar and I wish to revise and update the Handbooks inaccuracies that are (c) inconsistentunclear; (d) not conducive to uniform or consistent enforcement and need to be updated to reflect developments that have taken place since the guidance was issued.  FTA Recipient auditors are inconsistently cherry-picking which excerpts to enforce, many of which conflict with 49 CFR Parts 661 and 663, causing major concerns in the industry at all levels.

Our proposed solutions provide descriptive alternative guidance that FTA can simply Cut & Paste over the applicable existing text.   

Please contact Mr. Policar at (206) 477-5878 or steve.policar@kingcounty.gov or me whenever we may be of assistance.  Steve and I welcome the opportunity to meet with you in Washington, DC to work through these issues and participate in future stakeholder meetings. 

Thank you for your consideration.

As ADA Coordinator for the County of Riverside Transportation Department (California), I would like to express a desire for USDOT/FHWA to provide guidance and to adopt the Public Right of Way Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG).  The draft PROWAG was initially drafted in 2011, for which the public comment period closed in 2013.  

ADA Coordinators for local agencies throughout the nation are trying to enforce draft PROWAG design standards within public road right-of-way for which the USDOJ and USDOT/FHWA and US Access Board have found to be ""best design practices,"" but for which the US government has not yet adopted.

Accessibility design in public road right-of-way poses unique design challenges that are much different than the building accessibility design standards contained in the 2010 ADA Standards.  Working without adopted regulations is hampering local agency efforts for providing accessible pedestrian facilities for persons with disabilities, a civil rights issue outlined by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

It is our understanding that the current Presidential Administration is opposed to issuing ""new regulations.""  

We would like to respond by saying that ""less regulation"" is not ""better business"" for agencies trying to implement accessibility goals for Americans, including disabled veterans, children, elderly and others.",,,,,,,

Is this certification only required if a transit system requests to purchase a non-lift-equipped vehicle as described in the first referenced guidance, or do transit systems have to complete the certification if they have any of those vehicles in their fleet as referenced by the ADA Q&A guidance, slides 9 and 10?




Special Section 5333(b) Warranty regarding labor relations and unions.  How does this apply to our applicants who only have grants for Purchase of Service and do not provide transportation services?  Do they need to complete this form?",,,,,,,

In other words, states are required to consider both asphalt and concrete paving materials in a way that fairly compares them. Unfortunately, FHWA is not enforcing these federal policies appropriately and as a result, many state DOTs do not consider alternative combinations of materials (competition) nor do they use life cycle cost analyses to inform pavement type selections. This lack of action on the FHWAs part is clearly and demonstrably costing taxpayers money  roughly $5 billion each and every year, according to industry and MIT estimates. By rectifying these problematic stewardship oversights, U.S. departments of transportation could complete roughly 10% additional infrastructure work at no additional cost to the taxpayer.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2017-0069-2872/attachment_1.pdf",

This discrepancy gets in the way of local workforce development boards and their partners from implementing additional methods of getting unemployed and underemployed people back to work. In order to realize the maximum benefit of federal infrastructure projects and achieve President Trumps vision of rebuilding our infrastructure while putting millions of Americans to work, consistent policies are needed to address targeted hiring and funding related to job training at the operating administrations within the DOT (Federal Railroad Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, and Federal Highway Administration, etc.).

Our recommendation is based on our experience recommending targeted hiring policies for the California High Speed Rail project.  These proposed policies were deemed constitutional by the DOTs Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and adopted by the California High Speed Rail Authority. During the course of this long-drawn-out process, discrepancies between the DOTs operating administrations became apparent. While the Targeted Hiring recommendations were eventually cleared by the FRA, and nearly-identical recommendations made by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority were cleared by the  Federal Transit Administration (FTA), confusion still exists within the DOTs other operating administrations  namely the Federal Highway Administration (FHA). During a meeting with California Department of Transportations Director, he stated that targeted and/or focused hiring initiatives are not allowed by the FHA. This sentiment has been echoed by those within that administration, despite the fact that targeted hiring initiatives have been allowed by FRA and FTA after full vetting from their legal counsels. What is deemed legal by two administrations within the same department should be allowed by administrations throughout the DOT. Clearly, a uniform policy is needed, the result of which could be increased job opportunities for Americans in disadvantaged communities that need them most.

Federally-funded public infrastructure projects have the potential to produce multiple economic benefits, including the creation of employment opportunities for the nations most economically disadvantaged areas. In its 2017 Annual Report, the DOT estimates that transportation accounted for 13 million jobs or 9% of the U.S labor force.  Targeted hiring initiatives and related job training strategies increase the likelihood that unemployed and underemployed individuals in economically distressed communities have access to these jobs. Currently, the U.S. DOT and its various administrative units lack a uniform policy for either targeted hiring initiatives or funding for concomitant job training.
  
We request that the DOT adopt a uniform policy that applies to each of its operating administrations that allows for targeted hiring initiatives on federally funded projects. The FRWDB further requests that each operating administration be allowed to use a portion of its funding for job training related to DOT projects.",,,,,,,

On behalf of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), I am contacting your office to submit comments regarding the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Notice of Review of Guidance docket number DOT-OST-2017-0069.

The AASM is a professional society that represents a membership of 10,000 physicians, scientists, advanced practice practitioners, allied health professionals, and accredited sleep centers. The AASM is the leader in setting standards and promoting excellence in sleep medicine health care.

Over 475,000 police-reported crashes involved large trucks in 2016. Of these, 3,864 were fatal, and 104,000 caused serious injuries. Thirty seven percent of all fatal crashes, 23 percent of all crashes involving injuries, and 20 percent of all property-damage-only crashes involving large trucks occurred at night (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.).1 These data indicate that our highways are far from safe. One potential cause of vehicular crashes is inadequate sleep, either through insufficient opportunity to rest, work schedules that are misaligned with biological sleep schedules, or intrinsic sleep disorders.

Over the last two years, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has rolled back and removed several safety rules and regulations, and it withdrew a proposal to regulate the management of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea among operators.2 Similarly, earlier this year, FMCSA removed state-mandated meal and rest breaks for California, despite the fact that fatigue or inattention caused by long driving hours without breaks can contribute to an increased risk for crashes.3

The following comments refer specifically to the proposal to repeal existing guidance documents published by the FMCSA. The AASM states clearly and unequivocally that repealing these documents neither maintains nor improves the current level of safety.
  
Guidance documents serve the critical role of providing a common framework for medical examiners, in the depth and detail required when addressing medical disorders that can impact driving safety, and with content that was based on input from experts in their respective fields. While National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners (NRCME) courses provide some level of training, these courses are developed and administered by third parties with minimal oversight. Not all NRCME training courses cover material in the same level of detail, nor in the same manner. Thus, considerable heterogeneity exists in the value and content of these courses. Such variability undermines the goal of ensuring a robust, reliable process in determining medical fitness for duty. 

Examiners, therefore, who cannot reasonably be expected to be content experts in all aspects of medicine, must continue to have access to the FMCSA guidance documents to review in concert with their own clinical judgment when making safety-sensitive medical decisions. As to replacing or modifying guidance, the AASM wholeheartedly supports updating existing guidance to reflect changes in the science and current standards of care. Many guidance documents would benefit from such review.  

Therefore, we strongly recommend:

1) Placing all guidance documents - including all Medical Expert Panel (MEP) reports, letters of instruction or guidance from FMCSA, and all recommendations/reports from the Medical Review Board (MRB) - on an easily accessible website, with quick links that examiners can use to access these resources when needed; 

2) Advising examiners that recommendations provided by these documents should be considered minimum standards of care, and not a substitute for clinical training, judgement, and more current guidelines from other professional organizations; 

3) Updating outdated MEP reports to reflect current state of the science; 
 
4) Updating and re-publishing the previously removed Medical Examiner's Handbook. We cite the Federal Aviation Administrations Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners as an excellent example of a living document that provides up-to-date guidance to examiners, and we encourage development of similar documents for all modal agencies.

Thank you for your consideration of these comments.

Sincerely,

Indira Gurubhagavatula, MD
Chair, AASM Public Safety Committee

Docket DOT-OST-2018-0030
 


Dear Department of Transportation:

Below please find a comment related to the above docket matter.
Interest of Commenter:  I have been a member of the American Airlines rewards program, and predecessor programs, since 1997. (American # 0L8_ _ _ _ - last four digits redacted).  During that time I have had the highest level of status and am currently what American calls Platinum.  I have flown during that time period anywhere from 50 to 125 segments a year on American and predecessor airlines.  I also have a Qantas frequent flyer account.
Every day for the last few months, I have sought to purchase a flight from Reagan Washington National to either Queenstown, New Zealand (ZQN), or Auckland, New Zealand (AKL).  I have sought to either purchase four tickets with cash or to use the over 1,000,000 frequent flyer miles my family has accumulated.  
My efforts to procure tickets have been a complete failure.  
{REDACTED FOR SPACE TO FIT, SEE PDF FOR FULL COMMENTS] 
Purchasing Qantas Tickets: You might ask, so why not just buy a ticket if you cannot find a way to spend your 1,000,000 miles to get to New Zealand?  I tried that too, without success.  First my Qantas experience.  I attempted to purchase business or first class tickets from DCA to Queenstown, New Zealand for April 9, 2020 (and adjacent dates).  It seems that Qantas doesnt make that route available under the status quo, and if the JBA would fix that, I wholeheartedly support the JBA.  Regardless, that makes purchasing a Qantas ticket from DCA to ZQN  either in first class or business  a total impossibility.  If, however, I wanted to merely purchase a ticket departing from Dallas, Qantas permits me to purchase Dallas to Sydney to Queenstown.  Of course I am sure I could probably purchase a ticket from Brisbane to Queenstown, but alas I am not in Brisbane any more than I am in Dallas. Under the status quo, Qantas does not make any routes available between the two points I wish to travel  namely DCA to ZQN, despite only requiring two stops (DFW, SYD).
Purchasing American Tickets: Heres where it really gets strange.  For the last few weeks I have attempted to purchase American Airlines tickets from DCA to Auckland.  Remember, we have over 1,000,000 American miles, but alas they have proven to be as useful as Confederate script to get to New Zealand. Moreover, American will not allow me to route into Queenstown (ZQN) at purchasing a ticket despite routing through Sydney where at least 2 Qantas planes will leave for every day. Instead, American has been offering business class seats DCA-LAX-SYD-Auckland for the eye popping amount of $16,839 per business class seat. Is the first 1 in the price a computer glitch?  Assuming the price is not an error, it is no surprise that American seems to not have sold a single seat at this price.  Air New Zealand and even Qantas is crushing American Airlines on price when it comes to travelling from DCA to AKL. Even within Americans own routes, there is something fishy about the $16,839 fare.  Round trip business class to Beijing China on the same day is $7,222, London is $5,912, Hong Kong is $7,338, and even Sydney at $10,549.  The business class segment over the Tasman Sea ups the cost over $6,000.  It leads one to conclude that current transpacific fares on American are as inexplicable as the American rewards tickets routing from Washington to New Zealand through Miami, Seattle or Fiji.
Position on JBA: To the extent the JBA improves these absurd circumstances, consider this a comment in support.  To the extent the JBA prolongs these terrible circumstances, consider this a comment in opposition.
Before the Comment Period Closes: My wife and I are going to continue to try to book tickets from DCA to Queenstown (or as a second choice Auckland) over the next 14 days that the comment period is open.  My wife, who also has American preferred status, and I will attempt to use either miles, or outright purchase some of the tickets we seek during the next 13 days.  She may leave a comment for you about our experiences attempting to do so related to this docket matter.  Perhaps the announcement of the JBA will itself improve these circumstances.  Either way, we will try to let you know if the situation has improved at all, or if we face practical impossibilities to obtain miles rewards tickets or even purchase tickets from our home (DCA) to our destination (ZQN or AKL) at prices that have a grounding in reality.
And if you are curious, the dates I wanted to travel to DCA to ZQN was April 9, 2020.  I wanted to return via Auckland (or frankly any city in New Zealand) on April 20, 2020.  We will continue to try to book a return flight on April 20, 2020 to DCA preferably from Auckland.  
Thank you for your time.

With a phony document from the internet, these people are traveling with out of control animals that spread E. Coli, parasites, viruses, and dander, endangering the lives of other passengers.  They defecate on seats and in aisles, and bite people and service dogs.  In an emergency such as turbulance, crash, or fire, they are loose and will block aisles and bite people, resulting in the loss of human lives.  They bark and meow for hours and many are unwashed and stink. Their stool is large and stinks.  Dander and smell travel through the ventilation system.  Should mentally disturbed people even be on a plane?

Perhaps requiring that travelers with emotional support animals pay the pet fee, enclose the animal in a carrier, and require a health certificate will weed out the phonies. Require the remainder to buy two bulkhead seats.  The animals, when seated on the aisle will block passengers from going to the restroom, or easy passage to an exit in case of emergency.

The person requiring an emotional support animal can hug the animal in a soft sided carrier and eliminate the dander, E. Coli, parasites, viruses, and defecating on seats and in aisles problem.  Requiring them to wash their pet before travel would be a bonus.  Also requiring training as a service dog, i.e., not to bark, bite, and defecate unless prompted would furthur weed out the phonies.  Everyone I met with a dog on a 10' leash seemed quite normal despite not hugging their pet.

A mentally disturbed person can hug a pet through a soft-sided carrier.  This would require limiting the size of animal but protect people with allergies, asthma, and compromised immune systems.  Or do we not have rights?  

The latest scam is offering a service animal package on the internet.  People with genuine service animals are as outraged as I am.

DOT created this problem.  Please resolve it.",,,,,,,

I have a husband who is allergic to the dander from cats and dogs.  He has a puffer which he uses for the asthmatic reaction when in close proximity to animals.  I was on a flight recently and informed the Airline about my concern when a service dog showed up in the waiting area at the gate.  I talked to the boarding agents, expressing my concern and asking that they check where the dog and owner were seated, and if they were in close proximity to us if they could change our seats.  I was informed that there were 3-4 dogs on the flight.  The agent said he would look after this prior to our boarding.  My conversation with the agents was 75 minutes prior to the departure time.  While I was boarding I asked what he had done and was told to step aside, and waited.  He then told me that there were dogs in row 19 and 20 and we were in row 21.  He told us to board and he would be in to help us.  As I boarded the plane I spoke to the cabin attendant who dismissed me and told me to talk to the attendant at the back.  We took our seats and it looked like there were no dogs in the 2 rows in front of us.  Then the same agent comes in escorting the service dog and owner to the seat directly in front of my husbands seat.  I jumped up and said, ""This is not going to work, you have to find us another seat.""  the owner of the service dog snaps back at me saying, He's a service dog and he's hypoallergenic."" which I reply, there is no such thing as a hypoallergenic dog, it still has dander."" ( I want to add that this is a big dog, possibly a labradoodle and not well groomed.  I could smell the dog the entire flight.)  I'm now out of my seat talking to the agent and the stewardess, clearly seeing that they are not going to do a thing. So I walked down the aisle asking  if someone would switch seats.  The head stewardess asks me to sit down, but I continue and finally as I'm near the end of the plane a lady offers to change seats with my husband.  Amen.

I want to add that people on the plane said things like the dog is a poodle and it's hypoallergenic, laughing at me.  This is how ill informed that people are.

Where are the rights of the passenger?  I paid over 1500.00 for each ticket and animal owners pay 50.00 to bring their pet onboard?  And of course service dogs and comfort dog owners fly for nothing.

To address the issue of service dogs.  I understand the need for them and the good that they do.  I personally have a friend who is blind and the dog is essential to his well being and livelihood.  There is though a big difference between a service dog and a comfort dog.  I am not trying to diminish comfort dogs and people who have emotional issues, anxiety and depression.  Just as they have needs so does my husband - he can't breath and has asthma when close to dogs and cats.  I'd like to know how these people would feel if they couldn't breath.  We also should be accommodated on the planes.  

I don't pay to fly with a bunch of dogs.  There should be a minimum buffer zone for those with allergies to pets, and airlines should be made to offer some flights with no pets.  There should be a designated area for the pets on the plane and an area that has plenty of leg room. ( The big dog on our recent flight did not fit into the leg space, and spewed over the floor infront of the next person.)
 
 Airlines recognized the issue with nut allergies and most airlines took action.  Why not do the same for allergies to animals.  Regulations are badly needed.
  
As human beings we all have needs, and the question is how to fairly accommodate everyone. ",,,,,,,

This proposal contains NO PLAN to deal with passengers with allergies! I searched the text for the term ""allerg"":
- ""Some individuals with disabilities prefer miniature horses to dogs because of allergies..."". Two references.
- ""Examples of work or tasks [performed by a service animal] include, but are not limited to, ...alerting individuals to the presence of allergens..."". Indeed.

I don't understand why one person's disability that is emotional in nature (ESA) currently takes precedence over another person's disability that is both physical and has a traumatic emotional aspect. Can you not imagine being forced into a confined space with a physical threat, and how it feels when your protests are met with uncaring neglect?

What is it going to take for regulators and airlines to sit up and take notice, a fatality and lawsuits?

As a person who has severe allergies to animals of all types it has become impossible for me to fly or travel by rail (within the USA) due to the number of animals in the passenger compartments.  I have done everything medically possible to reduce my reaction but can not travel with the number of animals traveling. That is discrimination.  I would like to see a revised wording of the ADA requiring true licensed service animals to have their credentials publicly visible and available for inspection (in all public places), all modes of transportation should only allow licensed service animals in the passenger compartment (therapy animals not included as they are not covered under the ADA and should not be) and there should be a mechanism to inform people ahead of time as to a service animal traveling or if a person with severe allergies is booked, no animals can be booked.

No one should be asked to share part of their personal space with someone else's service animal- we paid for the use of that space for our feet and bags, and the pressure to agree is unfair. If a passenger must have an oversized animal they can purchase another seat.

It is plain to anyone who flies that fraudulent support animals abound. There needs to be a federally regulated system to prevent this fraud. Other passengers should not be subject to the dangers and inconveniences of these frauds.",,,,,,,

I can take over the counter medicine to counteract the allergies, but none of my medications can deal with being trapped with a panic trigger.

Even then, service animals for the blind, those with a medical necessity, and who have had the training and authentic certification and can be calm in a plane I can deal with. Other people can't. People with severe allergies should not have to make concessions to those who opt to bring their pets on board. How efficient and effective is the cleaning between flights? Couldn't a person with a severe allergy still be triggered into an attack with the animal hair and dander left over from previous flights? I've read comments about how no-animal flights should be run once a day, but that one plane is still contaminated from earlier flights. Better certain planes and flights be designated for those with animals while the humans get priority.

It's not fair to people with special needs, on either side of the argument. Stricter regulations so only animals that have gone through the stringent training to become service animals can come aboard is a must, but it's against the law to demand to see a service animal's official papers (to my knowledge).

Emotional anxiety is a real condition that can be abated by an emotional support animal. Rather than exclude individuals with an emotional need in similar categorical strength as a disability perhaps we should work towards formalizing emotional support animals and then have them fall under the same rules in the ADA.

This will necessarily exclude animals and breeds that are not of the proper temperament or body type to truly provide emotional support as a service.

Emotional needs can be as debilitating as a disability or full-blown mental illness and so we should address this issue with the idea in mind that we provide support for those individuals who truly need it.

They are highly trained, non-aggressive, and critically helpful to their owners. But emotional support animals (ESA) are a dierent story, and their preponderance in such tight, close quarters has gotten out of hand. As one of the 10-20% adults who suffer from pet allergies upon exposure, I often y in fear of being seated near one of these ""support"" cats, dogs or birds. Despite the animal posing a ""direct threat to [my] health or safety"" (Air Carrier Access Act), it seems I would have to move to avoid an asthma attack (most likely to a less desirable seat than what I purchased and perhaps even without reimbursement for the dierence). That is unfair. Again, I'm not talking about actual Service Animals  I'd gladly make accommodations for the real deal. 

My suggestions for how to improve ACAA regulations to ensure nondiscriminatory access for individuals with disabilities, while simultaneously preventing abuse and fraud are as follows:

Bring definition of a service animal in line with the ADA definition  dog (or miniature horse) trained to perform specific tasks to aid their disabled owners. The disability can be PTSD or some other emotional affliction  there are specific tasks true service animals are trained to perform in such cases.

 Provide accommodations for those with allergies  in an effort to accommodate everyone with their support animals, we've become discriminatory against this group.

 Require people traveling with their animal to obey all rules and regs  handlers are responsible for their supervision and care at all times; the animal should not touch other passengers in any way; clean up after the animal; stay in their carriers if applicable; etc.",,,,,,,

My name is Karen Duet.  I am the founder of K-9 Companions Los Angeles and owner/founder of K-9 Companions Nashville. My veteran husband George Duet and I have been training dogs and specifically Service and Therapy Dogs for 40 years.  It is our wish to be of service to the Airline Industry as well as other businesses in the USA in straightening out the current Service Dog Industry mess.  The problem with fake Service Dogs has reached a boiling point.  This is not only an issue for businesses but also for REAL Service Dog owners who are viewed with skeptisism.
 
It is our belief that the ADA law should be changed to mandate Service ID's with trainers information.  Part of the issue is that the dog training industry is not regulated but we believe there is a solution to this which is fairly easy.  The AKC is already set up for such a task.  We would be happy to liaison for this with the AKC.  Dog trainers are concerned with political implications if one group or another takes charge.  AKC already regulates judges, has policies in place for complaints, and understands dogs.  There are certain groups that are trying to take over and create a monopoly.  We believe that the AKC can do this impartially and can create a standard that Service Dogs are trained by.  There is already and known standard for Service Dogs which is:  On/Off Leash Obedience, CGC, Minimum of 3 Service Dog Tasks, and Public Access Training with the dog being a minimum of 2 years old to be certified.  There also needs to be a minimum standard for Service Dog Trainers established.  
 
We are looking for the right person to connect with to get this ball rolling on a Federal level.  If you are interested please contact us and we will be happy to help in a way that is fair to all parties.

Attached is a copy of Service Dog Certification that we provide.  Please note:  Agency Name and Logo ID# and contact info.

I don't know where flying has become a right,  but it's really a privilege - that people have to agree to protect the rights and safety of every other passenger on the plane.  If people can not agree to this, then that is a conscious decision by them, and they should choose other travel arrangements,  or not take the animal on the trip with them.  Even in airport terminals where emotional support animals are to be in containers or carried at all times,  I see lots of dogs running around on leashes (and even a couple times not on leashes).  If the owners can't even obey these procedures they certainly can not be expected to follow safety protocols during an emergency.  I love dogs and have owned one for the majority of my adult life,  but that doesn't mean that they need to fly in the passenger cabin with me.  ",,,,,,,

I am appalled at the number of people who purchase Service Animal certificates and vests in order to bring their pet on board for free. Ive seen these animals bark, and/or whine through out long flights, disturbing passengers around them. Ive seen someone who was allergic to dogs have a serious reaction. Ive seen these fake Service animals defecate, urinate, and vomit. Ive even seen one bite a passenger, all things a true Service Animal would NEVER do. Unfortunately, I think the only way to curb these abuses is to require Service Animals to be certified. First, a medical doctor, who has been treating a patient for at least a year (to avoid doctor fraud), should attest to the need to have that animal WITH the patient on a plane. Second, the animal should have a certificate of training from an accredited training program teaching and evaluating  standardized skills required to to be a safe and non disruptive animal on a plane. Third, the size and type of animal should be limited. In an evacuation a Mastiff, for example, presents a danger to other passengers. These requirements could be grandfathered in so that anyone who wants to fly with their service animal knows they need to select one of the appropriate size and type. Fourth, animals should be required to be on leash and muzzled during the flight, because ANY dog can bite when frightened or threatened. Fifth, any dog who is disruptive in any way on a flight should be banned from flying, and the owner should pay for any damages. Sixth, any passenger who fraudulently identifies an animal as a Service Animal should be banned from flying. Seventh, anyone bringing a Service aboard should have to notify the airlines when purchasing their ticket and the number of animals on a flight should be limited. There should not be more animals than flight attendants so that in an emergency, if the animal panics or is injured, flight attendants will be prepared to assist the disabled person. Unfortunately, rules are made for the idiots, as my mom used to say. We need these changes to protect the truly disabled, and the other passengers who do not deserve to face the inconvenience and danger that these dishonest, selfish people faking a disability present.

Instead, what this means, is that many other passengers who are allergic to animals are forced to either not fly or take medications so that some else doesnt have to (this usually means an inhaler for asthma, Benadryl or other prescriptions), while reactions can take days to clear up. And since it can take at least a year to clear out animal hair and dander from a home, this means that passengers can have allergy and asthma problems even after an animal has left the plane. 

Animals should be allowed on planes in carry-on, but should not be allowed out, touching seats, passengers, or the floor. In addition, flight attendants should be given the authority to ask questions and confirm items about the people and the pet - just like they can ask for and dive into the medical history of someone with allergies. Finally, If the decision is made to continue to allow emotional support pets, airlines must include an equivalent amount of flights, at the cheapest rates, for pet-free flights. 

In addition to being a safety issue, this is a health and disability issue. ",,,,,,,

But each and every time I go out....I feel as if I have a target on my head, not because of my disability but rather because of my service dog.  There are so many animals out there that claim to be ""service"" animals that now even  a service team such as Marvin and I are questioned and look down upon.  Marvin has been attacked at least 6 times, we have been refused service at multiple restaurants, refused a train seat until cunductor notified and made someone move. On several airplane trips been snapped at and barked at by ""service"" and or support animals, picked up another service animals shit in the eating area of a cruise ship, also attacked by this ""service "" dog and again treated as second class citizen due to other people passing their family pooch off as trained service animal.
I understand people wanting to take their dogs everywhere. But it's not only not fair to people with disabilities who have well trained service animals ; but also not fair to take these poor animals out into loud, busy, scary places and expect the animal to behave and stay calm.
I feel the best answer for all concerned, whether service animal  or emotional support animal who wants to access public transportation should be a required ""public Access test"" and certification. This could be via a government entity or using the testing already available through many service animal providers. As it is CCI makes our teams complete before graduation, at one year, and then every 3 years. Key would be to make PROVIDERS and teams responsible for inappropriate behavior in public.  Then no one could buy it over the net! Or better only certain providers could test, for$ then these providers could supply more well trained animals to disabled people like me. By the way CCI provides Service animals 100% free to those people who need them and have gone thru the application process.
I only speak about CCI because this is who I have obtained Marvin from and can't speak of other organizations. 
Also please don't say getting a public Access card would identify is as disabled...the service dog does that. 
Honestly,  I'm sure most, if not all, emotional support and or service teams would appreciate a public Access card to put a stop to the rampant abuse of false emotional and or service teams.",,,,,,,

I find that the DOT has created rules that make it a challenge for me to have access to flying all major airlines. The airline industry has made it incredibly hard to travel period imagine adding a Service Dog to the mix . I blame those that took advantage of a weak system. However, fort he past 4 years that I had my Service Dog, I have refuse to travel most major airlines and now have taken to riding trains with my Service Dog. 

As you already know most major airlines have these stipulations to fly with my Service Dogs are as follows: I need to have a signed document from a psychiatrist, veterinarian and myself (the passenger). This does not take in account a passenger that sees a licensed social worker or psychologist sporadically for many reasons (uninsured, unable to afford health care costs, transient, etc.). This is a huge issue with meeting the first criteria. No other public place requires such documentation. It is illegal for a majority of places to even require such documentation. Further, I feel that it opens up discriminatory treatment from airline crew members as psychiatric illnesses qualify for Service Dog by the ADA. 

Perhaps if crew members were properly trained there wouldn't be such issues with Service Dogs to begin with. Train them to know the ADA Law, which questions to ask people, observe dog behaviors. Granted people do take advantage of the ADA and have ""fake service dogs"" or people want to avoid the pet fee. Perhaps airlines can use different documentation methods. If the federal government can deem me to have a psychiatric disability - but the airline companies don't is quite odd. Further, the costs involved. I'm low income and the $200+ cost to get a documentation plus the 2-3 months in advance for scheduling. If I am taking a last minute trip the next week for a job interview in NYC and I live in Denver, then I will not be able to get the documentation in time. 

Should the DOT amend its service animal regulation so psychiatric service animals are treated the same as other service animals?  Yes. I do not want to be discriminated against because my disability is invisible. It is also impossible to purchase a ticket 12-24 hours in advance. I purchased a ticket the day before and was disqualified because of the time frame. It takes United Airlines 2 days to review paperwork. My family works in the airline industry - they get benefits and they travel last minute. I can't even travel with them because of the stress it brings my family with flying with a Service Dog due to the airline conditions. I'm sorry I can't purchase this last minute airline ticket on United for $150 because I have to fly Southwest at $500.


In the 4 years that I do fly with my Service Dog - she is well behaved to a point where crew members and passengers are amazed at her behaviors. She has internationally traveled on 13+ hour flights.

 She has saved me from panic attacks on flights to which being thousands of feet above sea level and having a panic attack is scary just thinking about i. My Service Dog sits in my lap (she is a 10 lb Service Dog) and sleeps during the flight on her pillow and blanket. I use key words - ""I don't feel well"" or ""I'm Sick"" and she will perform calming and walking assistance to get me to sit down (unless I'm on the flight). She listens to voice tone and body language - too high pitch or too low pitched - performs calming tasks and distraction tasks to regain focus or resetting my mood to not experience a panic attack or manic behavior or episode.

Either way my Service Dog has changed my outlook on life to where I can travel and she LOVES traveling too. She's an international traveler and always ready for our next big adventure together. Prior to having a Service Dog my next big adventure was being on the couch for 2 weeks straight depressed and never leaving the house.  

One huge recommendation - it'd be nice to have flight crew offer us both water. We share one cup of water together. People do not often realize that dogs do get dehydrated on planes too.",,,,,,,

It is undeniable that thousands of people are able to live functional, independent lives despite debilitating mental and physical disease due largely to the services provided by a properly trained animal.  Service animals are absolutely essential and necessary for these individuals and mandating businesses, residences, transportation, etc to allow these animals is unarguable.  

Conversely, public safety must be preserved and every effort taken to insure that service animals do not pose a danger to other animals or humans especially given that they are allowed mandatory access to places animals typically are not allowed for safety or health reasons.   Businesses have a duty to protect their patrons in addition to the obligation to following the law regarding service animals often putting them in an impossible, unfair dilemma.   

Currently, it is as simple as a small amount of money to an online business to get a service dog vest and ID card.  No proof of needing a service dog or appropriate behavior is required.  Medical privacy laws prevent the general public or business owner from verifying the need for and actual qualifications of a service dog.  So these people are free to falsely claim their pet is a service dog - which is bad enough itself but typically these pets are as rude and as spoiled as their owners creating chaos disrupting businesses, behaving in such a way as to create health concerns in the food industry,  threatening or actually attacking people, and preventing real service dogs from performing their tasks. This is unacceptable and cannot continue. 

The problem is escalating rather than improving - self-regulation is not going to happen.  The ONLY way service animals can be allowed to function AND public safety preserved is by the government regulating service animals.  The current laws and regulations do not provide a means for minimizing fraud, for insuring that the service animals are trained properly to pose no danger to public safety, or for allowing businesses to protect the safety of their customers from untrained, false service dogs.  The government has to step in to force people to act like responsible adults.  People with true disabilities requiring a service dog to lead a functional independent life have enough hardship already - they do not need additional problems and requirements.  But, as often happens in life, the responsible have to ""pay the price"" for the irresponsible.  I have debated and considered many solutions and the only one that I think can be effective is the following:

(1) Some agency (perhaps the department of agriculture or the state veterinarian's office or  . . . ) has to be given responsibility to authorize/legitimize service dogs and the ability to punish those violating these procedures.  

(2) This agency through its own employees or perhaps working through professionals (for example most veterinarians become accredited to work as agents for the department of agriculture in issuing health certificates and reporting zoonotic disease)  will certify the animal is properly trained to be in public.  Again medical privacy is a concern so handling that certification while protecting privacy may be difficult.  A test such as the one that American Kennel Club offers - the canine good citizen test - might be the criteria to determine a dog is ""safe for public"" and the actual service work (ie seizure detection, low blood sugar detection, etc) may not need governmental approval since the government's concern is public safety not the medical aspects.  The animal's personal trainer can address the actual service work.  

(3) A legitimate medical need (physical or mental) is established via a medical care professional ""prescription"" with the   registering agency.  

(4) If criteria met - medical need and safe behavior - this agency would issue a service animal license to authorize access via ADA regulations.  This license, if state issued, needs to be accepted nationwide.  Without an official license - no access.  

In short - set up/assign a overseeing agency, require medical documentation for needing a service animal, certify the animal is not a public threat (graduating from recognized professional service dog trainers, has canine good citizen title, specific criteria assessed by professional such as vet or trainer, etc) then issue an official license.  Punish those attempting access without a license. 

If you have any want or need to further discuss this matter with me, I will be happy to.

People often want to get their dog ""certified"" as an ""emotional support animal"" or ""service dog"" so they can take them anywhere. The truth is there is no required certification at all for any service dog. Not even dogs for the handicapped or blind have a legitimate certification of training for their dog unless it come from a private company or organization. But you can find police dogs that have state mandated certifications in order for them to work on the street.

 If the government would come up with a national certification for all types of service animals you would not have the problems you would see today. Such as a pitbull attacking a child at a terminal, or a dog being a nuisance on a flight. If there was a test that the dog had to complete Fido could prove he could be in the same area of a child without reactivity, and also prove he can withstand long flights without losing his bananas. The only way to come up with such certification is to collaborate with industry professionals.

Can a dog help with PTSD and mental issues? Of course, research has proven that, but the dog and handler should have to prove that they can do a job in any environment before going into a public setting. Just like a driver's license, handlers should also have to take some course proving they have the knowledge and capability of handle the dog.  If handler and dog both received training and earned a license problems would not occur. It would also be very easy for airlines to see who is real and who is not because it would be a license issued by the govt or DOT. ",,,,,,,

I work with Individuals training their own service dogs to help them with their disabilities. This is a daunting task to say the least. Approaching access issues is a situation altogether a different struggle. I try to help with this as much as I can. So that they do not have to fight this battle alone. It is frustrating to go into an establishment and see an untrained dog and for that dog to start barking or to be jumping on other customers, or worse have an accident in the store, and the person act like it is not their responsibility to clean up. I do believe their needs to be a standard of training a dog should be required to pass. I believe this is already in place. I believe the American Kennel Club has the best test already in place for these requirements and if these are put in place would not cost the Government anything. 

The American Kennel Club Created the Canine Good Citizen test in the 80's its a 10 part test that tests a dogs social skills. Skills around another dog, skills for being pet by a stranger, and being handled. If a dog cannot pass this test they should not be allowed in a close confined area like a cabin of a Airliner. That is putting other people in jeopardy. These flights are stressful at best. Feeling the tension from all the passengers and themselves, and in a close proximity, a CGC is a minimum requirement. 

The American Kennel Club has also created other tests sneak the Canine Good Citizen, Called, Canine Good Citizen Urban- The Pubic Access Test, I believe all Service Dogs Should pass this test. And all MY Service Dog Teams do pass this test. It is also a 10 part test but completed in a public location in realistic environment to create a real situation for a complete day of activity in the public. 

The American Kennel Club is VERY Thorough on who they allow to become Evaluators to conduct the CGC tests. a trainer must prove hundreds of training hours and teaching hours. the AKC follows up with the references submitted. Then they trainer is either accepted for denied. The trainer has to reevaluate every two years. 

The test is conducted but the evaluator with the dog and person. A dog cannot be tested until the dog is with their person and handled by their person. They will receive a certificate from the AKC proving they have passed this testing. 

Leaving things the way they are now on the honor scale is not working. People are taking advantage of others and of the airlines. We have to do something.

Many service dogs can be trained by their owners. Some naturally detect low blood sugar, ect. But what many dont understand is their service dog MUST also BE TOTALLY social to people/dogs & not be unruly when in public. 

Many people can not afford the $3-$20,000 to get their own service dog so they do their own. Perhaps if the dog can pass an evaluation before boarding to see if they are social with dogs & people(espChildren)or not,  at least they wont be a danger to any other people/dogs if they pass the evaluation. Something has to be reasonable financially & should be done at least every 6 months unless the dog passes with flying colors with NO concerns whatsoever.


Perhaps charging a small fee to pass the test for the year. What people dont understand is if their service dog is NOT social than its fearful of whats going on around them & not paying attention to their handler who may need their help & wont get it.

I, myself, am a k9 behavioral modification trainer, & I am starting a certificate program to certify service & emotional support dogs as social that is alot less expensive than service dog training & requires 6 month recerts as dogs can regress as well if socialization is not continued on a regular basis. This has come about as several of my own clients service dogs have been attacked by other ""service dogs"".",,,,,,,

Look, I get it. I love my dogs and want to take them everywhere. But if all of Americas tens of millions of pet dogs came with us onto flights, into restaurants, and other places where pets dont belong, wed have a real public health crisis on our hands.

The Americans with Disabilities Act governs access across all public places. It mandates that access must be granted to people with disabilities who need service dogs, and it provides the primary definition for service dogs: dogs trained to perform a specific task in aid of the disabled. It also says that business owners and their like may not question a disabled persons need for a service dog; they may only ask if the dog is trained to assist with a disability and which actions its trained to perform. The ADA specifically EXCLUDES access for emotional support animals. Flights should do the same.

And while we're at it, can we work on making sure that parents actually PARENT their children on flights???",,,,,,,

A Service dog and Emotional support animal are NOT the same thing. Service dog is a well trained DOG that helps it's handler with their disability. 
An Emotional support animal is just for comfort.
I also train service dogs there is a requirement for training. There is no requirement for an emotional support animal to be trained.
As for certifications there is no certification for Service dogs or Emotional support animals PERIOD.
Some organizations give out badges for ID ONLY. The crap bought off the internet to say their dog is certified should not be accepted as ANY kind of proof of anything.
Like the FHA they require proof not of disability but of a Doctor letter or prescription saying that a Service dog or Emotional support animal/Companion animal will help mitigate symptoms or help of whatever ails the person.
This is totally legal to ask for in this situation and most people with legitimate need for an assistant animal will have this or can acquire it from their healthcare provider.
The ADA does not only protect the Service dog team it is there for the businesses also if they are educated on how the ADA works for service dogs and ESAs.
The Airline can set parameters solely based on what the ADA states and be protected by it as long as it is followed in the correct manner. This should not be so hard to understand
If the rules are followed properly the fake ones will be turned away or properly handled like any normal pet that is loaded for travel in the belly of the plane. People are going to get upset but as long as the law is followed they are just gonna have to deal with it.
If someone has an ESA or more than one they should only be allowed to travel with one, if they want more than one to travel with them then it will have to be in a carrier and considered like an ordinary pet in that instance. I believe for traveling purposes only the ESA should be limited to just a dog nothing else.
Cats are a stretch because at least you can go through training classes with a dog.
The only animals that are considered as Service Animals are Dogs and Mini horses. It is common sense that a mini horse is definitely not flying on a plane. 
I believe that an ESA especially a dog should have to go though an AKC canine good citizen class proving that it has and is going to act properly in public.
The Airline can legally ask for that certificate of training along with the Doctor letter to help minimize unruly ESAs. This is why only cats or dogs should be considered.
I don't care how many Emotional support animals someone has if you have to travel consider getting a dog that can be trained to act appropriately while traveling with you.
The Airline can put these parameters on ESAs legally because there is no standard on what an ESA is or has to do per the ADA. There are Standards for Service Animals.
I think everyone gets confused when it comes to laws of what can and cannot be said or done when it comes to Service dogs or ESAs.
Get very familiar with what the ADA says.
My personal opinion on how this should be is and I tell all my clients that documentation is the key to any legal issue.

For Service Dogs always document your training sessions, have a training log
Always have up to date shot records
Acquire a letter or prescription from your healthcare provider stating that a service dog is recommended for your treatment plan. 
Once they are ready to proceed in training I conduct the AKC Canine Good Citizen test and provide documentation that they have been through an 8 week class
We move on to more training and eventually I give a Public access test before blessing off that they have completed their training. 
Not every Service Dog owner will have this because it is not required to go through any formal training but it is what I Do for my clients. 
When I travel I have to provide my Prescription from my doctor I believe this is totally acceptable for Service dog teams


For ESAs I do not train them but this is what I would recommend
Dogs should be allowed for travel only because they can be trained to act appropriately in public
A letter or prescription from their Healthcare provider. Since they are Emotional Support Animals that tells me that they should be being treated by a mental Health doctor 
or the one who provides you your mental health medication not just any doctor. So an Ortho doc cannot give this kind of letter hopefully you get what I mean.
A current certificate of an AKC Canine Good Citizen test. It expires every year
Current Vaccination record

This is basic stuff that should be considered and is not hard to accomplish if people are in legitimate need of a Service Dog especially an ESA
A travel bag with basic essentials to care for the animal properly while traveling including wipes or something to clean up accidents because ACCIDENTS do happen.

We do allow pets on our buses if the pet is in a carrier, or if the pet is too large for a carrier, it must be muzzled. And it must be under the control of the person who brought it on, at all times. If a dog becomes disruptive it, and the person who brought it on, will be removed from the bus as soon as the next bus stop is reached.

 Everyone has a service,therapy or  emotional support animal. 

The  solution  to this entire problem is licensing. State and Federal licenses are needed under the owners social security number. Every us citizen has a social security card or eligibility. Proof of individual liability insurance  in case the animal injures someone, does harm or damage. Require all to be registered with their state. The requirements should be successful completion of training.Skills test and a medical statement from their physician . Containment of animals within the containment guidelines. 

IF you do not do this then you are dead in the water. IT's time to end this madness for the airlines and passengers.

I am particularly concerned with the way things were handled in June 2017 in Atlanta, when a huge dog attacked and mauled a passengers face while he was helplessly trapped against in the window seat.

Traveling by air is not a right but a privilege that you pay for dearly. If you have a true disability, your dog should be properly trained. It is possible that you might not be able to travel by air. It is not right to trample on the rights of all the other passengers just to accommodate one person.  I do not want animal dander floating in the confined space of an airliner, landing on my person or in my drink. 

Many passengers suffer because they are not allowed to smoke but they are told to just do without and that is acceptable. These people are addicted to nicotine and actually suffer on long flights. No one cares. This situation is no different. 

I think that something needs to be done to tighten up the requirements so that only medically needed service animals are on board . Service animals need to be trained and certified by reputable trainers. Online certifications by a ""doctor"" that has never seen the person or animal should not be accepted. Alternate methods of emotional support should be exhausted and documented first. ",,,,,,,

The airlines need to look at their own policies, and the need to make even more money off of the public.  To travel with a pet in cabin is now about $100 one way on domestic flights.  And that pet ""counts"" as your carry on so, in essence, those traveling with a pet in cabin are paying for their carry-on bag and also NOT allowed another carry-on.  And, that there are specific rules that have to be followed to carry that pet on top of the fees.  Maybe if the airlines were not so in need of finding yet another way to get more money out of the public, there might be somewhat less abuse of the system.

It is my opinion that emotional support animals should not be allowed to fly except under the same rules as pets (in carriers and for fees).

The exploitation of the system by people obtaining fake documentation so that they can fly for free with their pet in cabin has caused tremendous difficulties for those travelling with well-trained and legitimate service dogs and those travelling with working dogs on official orders.  ESA/pets are not required to, and very often do not have ANY specialized training.  The also have not had training or certification for public access.  Compound that by placing them into a confined and crowded space and it is a recipe for issues including the attacks on other passengers such as seen in multiple incidents. 

Individuals with legitimate service animals are already affected by their disability and their service dog provides them with freedom and assistance despite this disability.  The ESA/fake service animal negatively impacts their access by being confronted by aggressive and untrained dogs as well as the stigma that ESA/fake service dogs are having with their poor behavior.  

As a handler of a working dog who has legitimate reason to fly on occasion with my dog for official business the ESA/fake service dogs have become a big issue for us as well.  My working dog has been lunged at aggressively by ESA/fake services animals on multiple occasions in the airport.  On planes they have been disruptive.  Because of the wide-spread issue, airlines have become much less friendly to granting access to working canines as well, and now laws are having to be introduced to protect us.  If not for the explosion and exploitation of those with ESA/fake service animals this would not be necessary.

I hope that the Department of Transportation will support changes to the Air-carriers Access Act that will eliminate ESA access and crack down on falsely representing a pet dog as a service animal.  ",,,,,,,

Is there a way to have an ""access pass"" of sorts for dogs that have been on a flight and did fine, if signed off on by x number of flight attendants?  

Make it possible for airport staff and flight crews to report issues that could deny a dog access to a flight or future flights?  Each dog would have to be assigned a visible ID tag, that can be read from at least 2' away, for proper identification of offenders. Different colors could be used for different purposes as well.  It could be reported (by text or calling a central number) if they see the dog barking at another dog/person, pulling constantly on leash (when that is not a specific task for the person's mobility), peeing or pooping inside, or otherwise able to articulate how the dog is not under control. If a dog gets reported X number of times or by x number of people, it's behavior would need to be assessed by someone who understands dog behavior and can evaluate whether or not the dog is suitable for flying. It could also be evaluated WHO is doing the reporting.  Such as, if one person has made reports on just about every dog they have seen, that could be an indicator that the person just doesn't like dogs or has something against dogs in airports and the reports may be bogus. This could also serve to track how many incidents of improper behavior are seen on a regular basis. The tag could be issued when the person checks in and returned when they arrive at their destination. Staff could also report GOOD behavior, so if a dog gets a boat load of good reports and only a few bad, it would help weed out bogus reports of bad behavior. 

Requiring training certificates isn't likely to work as there will just be a market for those certificates the way there is for the bogus ID cards.  So I'm not sure how to ensure or enforce the training aspect other than observing the dog/handler prior to the flight. There are also issues with cost and access for people who truly have limiting disabilities (and only disability income and lots of medical bills) in getting their dog ""certified"" if such a thing were required.  So it would restrict those who need it most and the fakes would find a way around it. 

Definition needs to be clear- Service Dog is TRAINED to do TASKS that mitigate a person's disability.  This can include psychiatric tasks like interrupting self destructive behaviors, body blocking, physical pressure to ground a person, etc. IF the dog and person qualify for ADA protection, it is a Service Dog regardless of the person's disability and should be treated as such.  If the dog is not trained to do tasks that help the person with their disability or the person doesn't have a disability as defined by ADA, it is an ESA. 

ESA don't have public access so they are not exposed to things that service dogs are and ESA are more likely to freak out in a confined, loud, crowded, and moving environment.  While a Service Dog, that accompanies their person to all sorts of public places, has likely encountered crowds, tight spaces, all sorts of human behavior, other dogs, etc. And is more likely to handle the flight better.  The dog's behavior, pre-flight, should give a pretty good indication of whether or not the dog is a real service dog with public access experience, or if it is a fake. 
  
Is there any way flight simulators could be available for service dog training and to ensure a dog (or person with a disability) will be able to handle a flight before they get in the air and find out they can't?  Being able to handle such a simulation could give the dog a ""fast pass"" of sorts. It could also help autistic kids/adults, people with fears of flying, etc.

Emotional Support Animals (ESAs) present difficulties as so many are not adequately trained  - the adorable but excited dog jumping on kids or adults, doesn't know how to deal with the public, or crowds, other dogs or animals, noise, children - may pee on the floor if they get excited may lunge at near by animals, and sometimes - may be the dog who bites an adult or a child.

A Service Dog is the one who is not barking, lunging, chasing, jumping on people, peeing on the floor (or worse) or running up to other people and dogs/animals.  It is well trained, can interact well with the public, unobtrusive, and meet the needs of and perform the tasks needed for their handlers.

We struggle with the fallout of ESAs. Their behavior can be anything from docile, semingly friendly to snarling, or aggressive, walking quietly, or bouncing off the walls.  It's like the Forrest Gump movie - they are like a box of chocolate in that you don't know what kind of behavior you are going to get.  Anyone can bring their pet anywhere and instantly claim it is an Emotional Support Animal. That can place me and my Service Dog right alonside a family pet who is not trained, not used to dealing with the public or the noise and commotion on a plane, or other dogs.  That dog might be friendly - or it might not.  That presents a danger both to my Service Dog and me.  That Emotional Suport Animal can lunge, bark at, or attack my Service Dog.  At the very least, it's actions will distract my Service Dog from it's duties. At the worst, both my Service Dog and I can be bitten.

We need some safeguards, some basic requirements for ESA's who are out and about for the protection of the public, ourselves, and our Service Animals.  A badly behaved ""ESA"" makes it much harder for genuine Service Dog Teams - they gives us all a black eye and people tend to give us more grief because of a previous encounter with a misbehaving ESA.

Thank you so much for inviting our input!

Sincerely, Leslie D

P.S.  Everything I have said here can also be applied to fake Service Dogs - the one where someone buys a vest online for their pet, Fido,  and tells everyone he is a Service Dog so they can take him everywhere a legitimate Service Dog might be.  They cause the same problems as untrained ESAs, and for the same reasons.

There is no need for multiple ESAs. Passengers with ESAs should be required to submit a letter in advance from their treating physician stating they are disabled and have a disability related need for said animal. Similar to the FHA. I also think it would be reasonable to require ESAs to fit in carriers. Untrained animals that are too large to fit in their carriers present a burden and potential danger to other passengers as well as flight crew.

I think that service animals should NOT be required to provide a letter. Many service animal handlers are not in consistent treatment for multiple reasons. From simply not having the money to see doctors to having no reason to go to said doctor (for example a Deaf person does not necessarily go to an audiologist regularly because going to the doctor wont make them less deaf). I also think that service animals should include psychiatric service animals. Psychiatric service animals are held to the same standards as other types of service animals. Service animals should be limited to dogs and miniature horses. I think it is reasonable for airlines to ask the same questions that a business is permitted to ask per the ADA. 1) is that a service animal for a disability and 2) what work or tasks is it trained to perform. Legitimate handlers will be able to answer these questions. While service animals could not be kicked off mid flight for misbehavior, flight crew can be aware of the animals behavior prior to boarding. In the instance of questionable behavior, the handler should be given a chance to explain the behavior (sometimes tasking may look like misbehaving to the untrained eye), but in instances of misbehavior with reasonable belief that the animal may present danger to other passengers during the flight, it is more than reasonable to not allow to animal on the flight. 

The DOT should outright ban any ID or certification as being reasonable assurance that an animal is an ESA or service dog.

As a handler of a medical alert dog, I dont look disabled. I legitimately fear flying. Im afraid of harassment. Im afraid of other peoples untrained animals. Im afraid I wont be allowed on a flight simply because I look fine. Things need to change. But things need to change without making it harder on people who are already disabled and struggle with these issues.",,,,,,,

Being in close quarters with a dog is enough to set them off, and no allergic person should be forced to be in close quarters with an allergen just so that someone can travel with a pet (or glorified ESA pet). Others have phobias strong enough to trigger anxiety attacks or severe anxiety. And that's not even getting into the fact that many pets and ESAs are simply untrained or poorly trained, leading to inappropriate elimination, poor behavior, and, in some cases, outright aggression and attacks. 

Public transportation is for people, and for people's safety, we need to keep it to people only, making exceptions solely for those who need properly trained and maintained service animals, as defined by the ADA.

If a person feels that he/she need their ESA at their destination, the animal can travel where a non-ESA animal normally travels on a plane.

As a person with a disability and a certified dog trainer, I would make the following changes to the current regulations, the most important being a solid distinction between an emotional support animal (ESA) and a service dog (SD.) 

A service dog, including a psychiatric service dog, is specially trained in public access and to mitigate the handler's disability. For this reason, all service dogs should be allowed on all flights. It is acceptable and legal for gatekeepers to inquire about the tasks that the dog is trained to do. That would weed out the majority of fakes.

Since emotional support animals require no specialized training, they should either be banned altogether and treated as pet dogs, or required to travel in a carrier like a pet dog, because ESA's can pose a danger to passengers and service dogs due to their lack of specialized training to be safe in a public setting.  

Furthermore, one handler cannot safely handle more than one service dog, so the number permitted should be no more than one.

The same applies to ESA's; no handler can safely handle more than one. If ESA's are continued to be allowed to fly without a fee (like a pet dog), they should be limited to one. Any more than one is treated as a pet dog.

I have trained multiple service dogs for individuals with disabilities, and due to my position as a dog trainer and a person with a disability, I have been consulted by many dozens of people interested in finding out how to fly or obtain housing with their pet dog. Of the service dogs that I have trained, all have been trained to a level to be safe in public and to perform tasks to mitigate their handler's disability. 

Of the people that have contacted me regarding getting their pet dog designated as an emotional support animal, exactly zero of them needed the animal to mitigate a mental health condition prior to their desire to fly their dog or obtain ""no-pet"" housing. In my experience, 100% of ESA's are fake or designated as such by a person that happens to have a qualifying medical condition, solely for the purpose of obtaining housing or allowing their dog free air travel in the passenger cabin. I have never known a single person who already had a dog designated as an emotional support animal (ESA) prior to seeking air travel or housing.

To reiterate, I believe that the lack of specialized training in public access of ESA's is a detriment to passengers, crew and service dogs, including psychiatric service dogs, which are not the same as ESAs. The safety issues of ESA's far outweigh any benefit of allowing them free range on an airline flight. If a person with an ESA, who presumably would have a legitimate disability that qualifies them for an ESA, truly cannot travel without their ESA, they should invest in a trainer to ensure the animal is trained in public access and two or more tasks to mitigate the disability of the handler and enjoy all the benefits of a legitimate service dog (SD.)",,,,,,,

======
I have friends with guide dogs and diabetic alert dogs that have been hurt by increased regulation on service dogs. 
I would like to fly my own big and highly trained well-behaved, non service dogs in cabin .... just as is possible for small dogs today and am happy to pay for a seat for my dog. 
I have driven at great expense 4 time driven from CA to FL and back because I could not trust the airlines with my dogs, flying the dog in the hold....   
I have spoken to several people that abuse ESA because of the fear of losing their large dog if they fly as cargo/in the hold

I would suggest that you take a carrot approach to solving the ESA abuse and safety issue instead of a purely stick approach that I believe will only backfire

(1)  SUGGESTION:  Allow service dogs to be certified ONCE with the airlines  - Kind of like TSA-Pre -
WHY?   Do not subject service animal owners to 3 day delays in approving their flight. I have friends with true service dogs for whom this kind of delay and extra paperwork has become a barrier to their freedom.  What if someone with a diabetic alert dog needs to urgently visit a relative or get medical treatment via plane and can't wait 3 days?

(2) SUGGESTION:  Allow owners of well-behaved dogs (pick a certification such as AKC Canine Good Citizen)  or a temperament assessment of your choice,  to purchase a seat in cabin for their dogs to be seated in or contained in.  Make it a 1-time qualification subject to revocation if any issue occurs in flight.
  
WHY?  I believe that the majority of abuse (and I know this from talking to people that have abused ESA) is not due to the cost of flying a dog  as asserted in the proposed ruie

Abuse in fact  is due to FEAR THAT THE AIRLINES WILL LOSE OR HURT YOUR DOG. Your precious pet matters.  That is why you are flying with it.   The airlines have poor pet safety record in this regard .

While this fear persists, any regulation that you put in place will get worked around by these people and the problem will continue and will just get uglier.  In other words, you will not solve the problem with additional regulations and paperwork and inconvenience.     

You need to get inside the true cause --- To these abusers, their pets are their kids..  Ask yourself, would you want your child or grandchild to be separated from you during flight, or to travel alone in the hold of a plane?    

Or, as many of us that have sat in planes next to poorly behaved children, some carrying infectious colds.... Is a child truly better behaved or safer to be close to than a healthy, well trained dog?  My point - There is a bit of a double standard here and many dogs are truly much more pleasant to fly with than children  :-)

RECOMMENDATION: Since most well-behaved and well trained big dogs are accustomed to travelling in crates or containers,  it is perfectly OK to require that they travel in cabin, in a crate or sit in one in a seat that has been purchased by the owner, located next to their owner.  A crate would be the most safe for all concerned. The pre-req for doing this can be something like an AKC CGC certification,

(3) As to number of animals that could travel with their owner, I'd suggest 2 per traveler since many folks would like to take their well behaved animals on vacation with them but find themselves unable to due to the current airline restrictions.  2 dogs are manageable by 1 person.

Mental-emotional health professionals use counseling, psychiatric therapy, medications and other treatments to diagnose and treat most conditions. Many emotionally stressed people actually get worse when they have to take care of and feed, groom and walk an animal. Current evidence based medical recommendations do not include an animal.

When someone takes medication or sees a psychologist, it does not impact the other 100 people inside an aircraft. When they bring a dog to calm their nerves, it can create havoc.

We volunteer in the Juvenile Court system and public schools, and have for a long time.  We have no ADA rights and none are expected.  That said, I feel we need to establish some regulations as pertains to Service Dogs or ES dogs.  I have several suggestions to create a better environment for dogs who are needed to provide Health Services to their humans.

American Kennel Club already has in place a very inexpensive testing program that starts at ""Canine Good Citizen"".  It is low priced, widely available (and could be made moreso) with a large numbers of certified testers.  The dog must demonstrate some simple tasks of sit, stay and other basic household skills that all dogs should possess anyway.  There are a couple other skills which would also be good; added at the next level of testing such as non-reactive to other dogs and strangers, and quick recovery from a startle event.  Any dog without these skills could cause a potential problem in any public venue.

I realize cost of training might be an unfair hindrance to some who have need for a service dog.  That could be mitigated by provision of insurance coverage for a basic training and health check, or some scholarship funds provided if a doctor suggests a dog would be useful for the patient.  The AKC CGC is low priced.  My Therapy Dog certification is $30 per year and Health testing is less than $50 per year.

I fully believe in Service Dogs and the qualities of dogs that are useful to humans.

I am training my own service dog due to the fact there is only one school training dogs for the disability I have in the state I live in and there are mixed reviews about it.  If schools could be government certified, a national government test for dogs whether school or personally trained and a certificate that can be given and required to be presented upon request would solve most if not all of the problems with people trying to game the system.  Making it law that only dogs with this certificate can use any public transit or lay claim to being a service dog would put an end to abuse of the ""Service Animal"" issue.  For emotional support animal another set of criteria accompanied by appropriate laws should be set and again government certification.

American Disability Act already clearly defines what is a service dog and what is not. The key words are ""task trained"" which Emotional Support Animals and Therapy dogs are not. It also clearly states that the only two recognized Service Animals are ""dogs and miniature horse"". Majority of ESA's are the issue, for they are not required any training to make their person feel better. Service dogs on average go through 1-3 years of training and accumulate over 2000 hours of training in a year. ADA specifically states that ESA's and Therapy dogs do not have the same access rights as SDs. Service dogs allow an individual who has a disability that seriously prohibits their ability to be live as an average non-disabled person. Some service dogs even provide work that prevents loss of life such as diabetic alert dogs, seizure alert dogs, and guide dogs to only name a few. There are also psychiatric service dogs who assist our military veterans by preforming tasks such as deep compression therapy, blocking from bodily harm (cutting/suicide), and retrieving help. Bracing dogs are taught to become a standing crutch for their owners who fell out of their wheelchair, or are missing a limb. The key again is that all of these dogs are trained specifically to perform a task that mitigates their handler's disability. Majority of airlines also require prior notice to any SD teams flying through their disability assistance team. All other non-service dogs should be stowed in appropriate crates wether in the cabin or underneath. 

As it pertains to conflicting disabilities such as Allergies and another individual with a Service Dog such as guide and Medical Alert. The ADA requires all SDs to be well groomed at all times specifically reducing the risk of allergies from dander, bacteria, and such. Also more and more service dogs are becoming hypoallergenic breeds to further reduce pet allergens. If a person has a severe enough allergy to an animal it can cause them harm or death it should be well documented by allergy tests, and medical records just like a disability so there is not liability of an airplane company if one or the other has to to change seats, flights, or airlines in order to achieve both accommodations. Not everyone will be happy but they will be accommodated.

This proposal needs to be reworded with a clear definition that follows the ADA and a department wide retraining on relations with individuals with Service Dogs. For instance, simply asking ""Is that a service dog?"" and ""What task(s) is that dog trained to perform?"" the answers are a direct indicator of a valid service dog team. If they answer with ""He/she helps me feel better"" that is not a task and therefor would not qualify as a service dog. This does not violate HIPPA for you are not asking about the person medical history, or disability simply the dogs task training. I do not approve of this bill for it needs to be more accurate what rules, safeguards, and definitions the DOT is seeking, and RIN 2105-AE12 specifically excludes service dogs from its proposal. 

I am more then happy to further this conversation in a calm and explicit manner.

One is a mobility dog for a service related disability for my husband. His second dog as the first was retired due to age. The other trained for a medical condition I have.  Both dogs travel extensively and have been praised for their manners and attention to their partners. (us)  The American Disabilities Act already has in place reasonable and effective guidelines for service dogs. Whether they be guide, hearing ear, medical alert, or mobility. The dog MUST above all be controlled by her handler. Must NOT show any signs of aggression or present any behavior that might cause injury such as leaping at people. It appears to me that it has been so called emotional support dog who are not covered by the ADA that have been the source of troubles. These animals have no training requirements, no standard of behavior, NOTHING to define them. To compare this category of dog with service dogs who are trained to do a specific job is sheer idiocy. They are not service dogs, they have no rights under currant laws.  I personally have reported dogs obviously uncontrolled and in 2 incidents aggressive and growling at people passing.  Yet when I notified the people at the airport assistance gate of the obvious deception I was told the policy was not to risk offending customers by confronting them about their service dogs.  One of those dogs disrupted my 3 hour flight with nearly constant barking and howling. It reflected badly on all true service dogs including mine who quietly laid under the seat dozing.  We do not need more laws, we do not need government interference in the training of the dogs or what breed(s) are right for service. Many of us are on limited income and have limited resources. We do however take great pride in our well trained, well behaved, service dogs who allow us to go places and do things we could not without them.  I highly suggest not creating a knee jerk reaction ruling to the serious yet very few incidents with those emotional support animals which make the 24 hour news cycle. When every day hundreds if not thousands of service dogs quietly go about their job without incident and without the glaring light of that same 24 hour news cycle.  Instead I suggest that airlines, stores, and other public places stop being so PC stop being so afraid of offending. When they see a dog that is not controlled by her handler, when they see aggressive behavior those in authority should step up and confront the situation. Ask politely that the person remove the dog from the public area and inform them that uncontrolled and or aggressive behavior is not acceptable under the American Disabilities Act. Not only are you doing your other customers a great service for keeping them safe. You are doing those of us with service dogs an even greater service by not letting those imposters give our dogs a bad name.",,,,,,,

As service animal is task trained. Scent based service animals aid with medical conditions. An emotional support animal, while classified as a service animal, is not necessary for survival or rescue in medical situations. I have two pit-mixes trained as diabetic alert service dogs. I choose the breed because of their strength. I have MS, and the dogs are strong enough to help me if I have an MS event, such as my last episode of paralysis. I don't agree with a breed ban. However, I believe a review of what qualifies as a service animal is necessary. Paying 200 dollars to the national service dog registry does not qualify an animal as a service animal/dog. Federal law bans asking for proof of disability. The airline already has the right to refuse anyone on the plane if there is a reason to believe a problem may occur. If an animal looks aggressive, hyper, nervous, etc., the airline can refuse to allow them on the plane.
I am of the opinion a service dog should be able to aid the handler in a specific manner. If the animal is there to comfort you; it is doing what a good pet does. When your animal keeps you from dying, its a service animal. If your animal keeps you from committing suicide, you should probably stay home anyway.

1. Pets and Emotional Support Animals (ESA) need to stay home. They do not have the training required to be in public.
2. It should be criminal to pretend your pet or ESA is a Service Dog.
3. Psychiatric Service Dogs, which are different than an ESA by training, should be treated as other Service Dogs.
4. If a dog is showing questionable behavior it should be removed from the plane before an incidence can occur.
5. ESAs traveling on planes take up room for those of us traveling with our Service Dogs for work. This puts our trained and needed dogs at risk. 

I am aware of an incidence where a fake Service Dog was left unattended by its owner while on a plane mid flight. This dog left its seating area in coach and went to first class to attack another Service Dog which was traveling there.

Nor should they have to provide strip-search-level information about their disabilities to be able to bring their animal with them. During my travels, however, I have seen dozens of dogs (no peacocks yet) who are clearly not trained the same way. A few may even have been trained as ESAs, but they didn't easily respond to commands, were nervous the entire flight, and in one case, began to whine and pace. I find it selfish and cruel that people insist on taking Fluffy along with a false claim of ""she's a service dog"" when hundreds of disabled people would be happy not to have to rely on their service animal for help. It's disrespectful to them, and to anyone stuck around these posers in a restaurant or on a flight having to put up with it. I hate government regulation, but there has to be a simple set of tests for certain commands that would demonstrate proper training, as well as more clear-cut documentation for proof that the animal is a necessity and not an accessory. Having a disability is difficult enough; having to constantly justify your service animal or your need for it shouldn't be necessary. Having others think it's chic or an entitlement to mimic a real need for selfish reasons just makes it worse.",,,,,,,

I'd also like to see the unreasonable breed-specific regulations of airlines addressed at the same time. If a person's legitimate service dog happens to look like a ""pit bull"" it should not be up to the discretion of airlines to ban the dog because of a breed's reputation in social media.

Lest anyone think I'm anti-dog, let me go on the record: I'm the owner of two small dogs who could easily be declared ""emotional support animals"" under the current guidelines. I'll bet I (like so many others) could find an unscrupulous mental health professional to sell me a letter stating such (or just buying a harness online that claims it's an ESA and counting on airline employees to be cowed into submission). I love my dogs and would gladly take them with me - if not for the fact that such fraud perpetuates problems for legitimate service animals. Further, I'm a dog trainer. So, my dogs are well behaved in public. And it's STILL wrong to abuse the system as so many do.

Also, I understand the concern on behavior. What if there was a program almost like TSA precheck for service animals?

All service dogs welcome on the same terms weather medical alert, mobility or psychiatric service dogs. 4) honestly I'd be fine if airlines banned emotional support animals ridding in cabins but offered them to ride in cargo space. 5) all service dogs handlers should bring along a note that states their need for a tasked trained service dog, and records from the vet they are up to date on shots. 6) emotional support animals should need a doctor's note as well but needs to be dated within a month of their flight. Obviously they should need vet records as well. 7) if you continue to let emotional support animals in cabins I think it should be required for dogs to wear muzzles since it would not interfere with giving their handler comfort. However requiring service dogs to wear a muzzle would interfere with their tasks. 8) I cannot stress this enough (so much I'll say it twice) psychiatric service dogs are not emotional support animals and should be treated the same as medical alert and mobility service dogs. 9) you could require emotional support animals, if they wish for their dog to accompany them onto the cabin, to pass a good canine test provided by the airline (for free) which should include the dog preform basic obedience(sit,down,stay), a stranger walking up and petting it or being extremely close to the dog with it showing no signs of fear/aggression, the handler should also show basic control over the dog(doesnt have to walk in a perfect heel but not be lunging towards other dogs/people/kids, not barking excessively) 10) slap a fee on for ESA's to ride, no more free rides it'll deter those just wanting to bring their pet along with no real need, those who really need an ESA shouldn't mind paying a little extra. Could also require them to put a deposit down for cleaning fees, biting, etc that they could be reimbursed at the end of their flight if the Esa behaves accordingly, $200 seems reasonable to me. 11) should be made clear any ID's/ certifications/ registries are not legal and will not grant access to anyone who shows them.

These animals are part of our family. There are many airlines that treat me and my ESA dog wonderfully, and are welcoming and helpful. We have never had a problem at the ground level and crew. At the management level, some airlines objecting to Emotional  Service animals simply do not care about about customer satisfaction or customer service - they have been treating passengers worse than animals for years. There are many more incidents where animals are lost or die as a result of airline mistreatment, than with ESA animals misbehaving. Keep the current regulations in effect. Thank you.

True Service Animals are for the blind, etc   The problem is easily solved with Service Animals being required to get a Certificate of Service from a certified animal training company approved by the Government.  All other animals are then required to be paid for just like the Pet In Cabin owners do.  The fact that people feel entitled to their pet traveling for free has fostered the abuse of this policy.  Pay for your pet to be your emotional support and keep it under your seat just like everyone else.  So tired of how we allow and even foster this entitled behaviour.",,,,,,,

I have been flying with an emotional support animal (dog) since 2014. I have tried to take medications for anxiety while flying but I started to need a higher dose for effective control and the medication makes me too drowsy to drive (and taxis are too expensive when the airport is an hour drive away), and I have missed flight connections while on the anxiety medication. Flying with my dog is both more effective at controlling my anxiety and doesn't cause drowsiness. I fly with a 25 pound, non-shedding, italian waterdog. She does not fit in the type of carrier that fits under the seat, nor would she effectively control my anxiety if I had to keep her in a crate, plus that is one more item to have to transport through security along with a medical device and my personal items. The current paperwork I have to fill out to fly with her with Delta and American Airlines has been easy for me to fill out, and I am fine with doing so, my only concern is if I have to fly last-minute for a funeral or family emergency, I would not be able to fill it out 48 hours ahead of time as they require. If a training requirement is added to the rule, I am concerned at how that would take shape. I have been through obedience training with her, but what makes her safe to bring in an airport and airplane and be around people, including children, is her temperament and socialization, and I don't know that any obedience class necessarily ensures that. I agree that changes need to be made to ensure passenger safety and crack down on people faking emotional support status for their pet, but I am concerned with how it will affect my ability to fly with my legitimately medically required emotional support dog. I think airlines need to provide training for their employees to identify when a behavioral issue exists that may make a dog unsafe to go on a flight with passengers, and empower them to prevent a dog from entering the airport or airplane when it displays aggressive behavior, or nuisance behavior that the owner cannot correct within a reasonable amount of time. Airports also need to be equipped with better animal relief areas, and an easier way to get to those areas when flying alone. Unexpected delays and long layovers make a potty break necessary for most dogs, but at most airports, that requires going through TSA security. This is an issue not just for emotional support animals, but service animals as well. ",,,,,,,

A lot of them have been aggressive and clearly have ZERO training. Documentation needs to be required including the following:

1) Documentation from a mental health provider on a letterhead stating the person needs an ESA. The airline should be allowed to verify that the person is still in practice and contact them to verify that they wrote the person a letter. 

2) A Canine Good Citizen certificate from a valid institution such as an obedience school. Passengers should be required to upload them and the airline will verify it before that person and their dog are allowed to fly. A dog that is unruly would never be able to pass a CGC test so this would cut down on the problem significantly. 


It seems like many people in the comments though feel that their allergies or fears trump the ADA. Newsflash people: they don't. If an animal is trained to perform a specific task for their handler, it IS a service animal and can go wherever its owner does. Your allergies or fears won't ever trump the ADA EVER. An airline would get sued into oblivion if they did not allow a legitimate service dog onto the plane. There ARE service dogs that help with other things besides physical disabilities such a psychiatric service dogs.

Service animals are covered under the ADA; emotional support animals are not.  Almost any animal can be referred to as an emotional support animal.  Not true with service animals.  They require extensive training and certifications.  The most prudent solution is to ban ALL emotional support animals from public transportation, restaurants and stores while continuing to allow for service animals to accompany and assist with their disabled owners. 

Service animals are not to be approached or interacted with by the public.  They have received extensive training at substantial cost and are performing a job.  They are not to be distracted.

Emotional support animals receive little, if any training.  They provide comfort to owners but no discernible service.  

Without service animals, the disabled owner cannot fully function.  His or her life may be in danger without the services of the animal.  Without emotional support animals, the owner may be upset, uncomfortable or lonely.  He/she are still able to fully function and perform activities of daily living without risk to life or limb. 

Service animals are needed.  Emotional support animals are wanted.  Please do not confuse the two.  Ever. ",,,,,,,

When traveling on an airplane, we take all available prophylactics in case a service animal is aboard.  This requires strong medications, such a steroids, that are not without side effects. Even with precautions, my son will become ill when aboard an aircraft with a dog and require further medications once arrived.
When a service animal is legitimate, i.e. used for the safety (epilepsy, diabetes) or mobility (sight) I have absolutely no objections as all citizens reserve the right of free passage.  However, when the dog is used for emotional discomfort, or for the convenience of the passenger who doesn't wish to put the animal in cargo, it is outrageous.  The emotional well being, which is a subjective experience, of another person does not trump my child's physical safety.  That passenger who feels emotionally vulnerable on a plane has other recourse, i.e. alternative modes of travel or psychiatric medication.  They should not be endangering my son's health for something that is not necessary.  I have no forewarning of their animal's presence and no recourse to alternatives once aboard.  I feel for people who are nervous aboard planes, but they are free to seek therapy, counseling, and medical intervention.  No amount of talking will change my son's immune system as it is an objective fact rather than a subjective experience.  Other people have no right to endanger my son's physical safety for the sake of their feelings.  While they may feel like they're in danger, even though they are not, their solution to perceived danger endangers my son in an actual, physical way.  Felling like one is in danger is not the same as actually being in danger.
This is my personal experience.  There are so many other reasons to support the limitation of animal passengers to true service animals.  For instance, there are many people who have an acute phobia of dogs.  The presence of a dog aboard a plane inspires true terror for them.  Why does the person with the ESA trump the dog phobic person?  To soothe terror in one person is to create it in another.
Please restrict animals aboard a plane to true service animals.",,,,,,,

I have seen large dogs in the aisles, climbing all over their owners and other passengers, as well as being aggressive to me and my dog.  
I personally do not object to being asked to provide (sign) a written statement as to what task my dog performs that is necessary for my well-being.  That, combined with vet certification that the animal is healthy and up-to-date on vaccinations are all that should be necessary for a service animal.  An ESA, on the other hand, should be limited, as is the ADA, to specific animals that are trained for support.  A certified statement from the owner or trainer that the dog has passed obedience training accompanied by a current letter from a licensed physician or therapist stating need is not beyond reason.  
Recognizing fake service dog and ESA registrations and refusing them is key to keeping the integrity of the system intact.

As a legitimate ESA handler, responsible dog owner, and service dog trainer in training, I have made sure to have my ESA trained to high standards. She has obtained her AKC CGC (Canine Good Citizen) title and knows more commands than many service dogs do. She is even used to demonstrate tasks to service dogs in training. I believe that a title such as the CGC (as well as a proper ESA letter, of course) should allow me to travel with my ESA outside of a carrier. I agree that there are people abusing the law; however, I believe you should also take action to protect the rights of those upholding it. I would like to see Psychiatric Service Dogs accepted same as all other service dogs, as they are trained to the same high standards. ESA's are a little trickier. I would like to see a universal form (designed by DOT specifically for airline ESA use-this way, people with ESAs do not have to pay for their doctors to fill out multiple forms depending on the airline) that needs to be filled out by a primary care physician/psychiatrist only (psychologists and LCSWs do not have the right to write prescriptions for anything other than ESA's currently, and I believe that right should be revoked by anyone other than a person who writes prescriptions-this will make it more difficult to abuse rights). As for the behavior of ESA's, I do not believe that they should be restricted to a carrier, as this would be discriminatory to people with ESA's over 20 pounds. Instead, I believe that some certificate of training should be required. For example, a CGC title shows that someone other than myself has tested me/my dog to show that she: walks well on a leash; is kind/gentle to people and other dogs; is able to handle major distractions appropriately; and knows her basic commands in high distraction environments (all without treats, I might add). This CGC test is widely offered and usually only costs a minimal fee (to get my dog tested was only $25 and the certification lasts for three years). I believe that anyone who needs an ESA (verified by a doctor or psychiatrist) and is willing to provide training certificates should be allowed to travel with their animal outside of a carrier. Please do not take away this right.

There are a few problems with the existing law...

1)  Anyone can claim an animal is a ESA without having to show any proof.  When challenged or asked, they threaten a law suit under ADA, and then they typically get their way.  (I like what one pilot said to me, ""If they are so fragile emotionally they need their pet, WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE THE DOING FLYING???"")

2)  Consideration is not given to the comfort, health or safety of other passengers.  I for one, am deathly allergic to cat dander.  I've already taken one trip to the ER for anaphylactic shock because of a cat.  Yet, I was told by one airline boarding attendant that someone's ESA takes precedence over my allergy.  Yet, on the same flight they removed peanut products because someone had a peanut allergy.  Human passengers should ALWAYS be given precedence over other animals. 

3)  A distinction needs to be made between a service animal that is trained for a specific task (e.g. seeing eye guide dog) and an emotional support pet.  As that pilot implied, do we want someone on a flight that is so emotionally unstable that they need to bring a pet with them?

4)  While this is out of the control of the DOT, the both service animals and ESAs  should require registration.  Registration should require veterinarian certification that the animal has had all of this shots and the ability to demonstrate that the animal can remain under the owner's control in stressful situations (like boarding lines or TSA checks.)

5) Speaking of control, the airlines, and especially the flight crew, should be able to refuse service to anyone with an animal that is NOT demonstrating it is under owner control.  Such things as constant barking that is not silenced by the owner's command, growling or hissing at other people, etc.  It should also be able to reject service based on hygiene. (i.e. if the animal is emitting a strong odor.)

6) Limit the variety of animals allowed to fly.  As noted by a USDA veterinarian, service animals are almost always dogs or miniature horses.  However, people are allowed to claim any animal as an ESA  -- duck, snake, tarantula, cat, etc.  Animals that can cause emotional upset to other passengers (i.e. snakes or spiders), shouldn't be allowed -- period.

While the DOT might receive push back from the ADA proponents who claim these people requiring ESAs are protected by the ADA, perhaps Congress needs to step in an create a law that better defines what classifies an animal as an ESA, where that animal can go in public, and allow for exceptions with the health, safety and comfort of others (in this case human passengers) are at risk.",,,,,,,

I have anxiety being around unfamiliar dogs, yet every time I travel now I have to be around someone's pet that they have called a ""service animal"" for their own convenience. It's inappropriate that their fake anxiety is respected more than my true fear of being around these animals. A true service animal is a remarkable thing and is easily recognizable by it's behavior. I've never had an actual service animal try to jump upon me or. I've lost track of the number of people I have heard fully admit to lying about their pets and thinking it's funny/OK. It's disrespectful to those who truly have a disability and disrespectful to the rest of us who don't want to sit next to someone's pet. These animals should be in a carrier for the whole flight. 

Recently, my husband and I watched someone put out a puppy pad so their dog could go to the bathroom on the flight right next to us. The flight attendants make it worse by refusing to say anything to these passengers. In fact, they often call the animals cute and pet them, encouraging the passengers to continue this disrespectful action.

Please take action to bring civility back to flying. There is a process for transporting pets and these people should utilize that process instead of disrespecting people with a true disability.",,,,,,,

I am an autistic adult, and the world is often overstimulating and confusing to me, leading me to have meltdowns in public. These often escalate to me making noises which are, frankly, a disturbance, or being unable to speak at all. My service dog, Mike, is trained to make me focus during these meltdowns, by providing tactile stimulation (forcing his head into my hands,) pressure therapy, and breathing support (he has been trained to breathe deeply while I am in a meltdown state, which my body then responds to and breathes deeper as well.)

While I personally have seen issues with dogs posing as ""service animals,"" including my service dog almost being attacked while at a pet relief area in the San Francisco airport, I am hesitant to these new regulations. I feel that they may make travel even more difficult for those of us who are disabled, in a few main ways.

Firstly, I am wary that they may pose issues for those of us who have trained their own animals. Due to financial restrictions and, quite honestly, prejudice from service dog training groups, I am one of many autistic trainers who have had to train their own animals. Most service dog trainers will not work with autistic individuals, even though there is a clear and present need for autism service dogs. Additionally, the cost of said trainers, even when one goes through the hours of searching for one who would work with them, is often prohibitive. Many autistic adults are unemployed, and it is extremely difficult to qualify for disability with an autism diagnosis.

Secondly, I am cautious about the suggestion of requiring a letter for access to a plane. This measure has not seemed to do very much in the way of deterring people from bringing ""fake"" emotional support animals onto the plane, so I am not sure as to why it would do anything. Currently, I could go onto roughly five different sites and pay fourty dollars to have a doctor write me a fraudulent letter. I feel that not only would this not do very much, it would be prohibitive to those of us who need service animals but are unemployed due to our disabilities, or have limited access to healthcare. I understand that these new regulations are trying to ""weed"" out the ""fake"" service animals and support animals, but I feel that they may block some that do, in fact, need them.

Lastly, I am extremely nervous about the lack of definition between psychiatric service dogs and emotional support animals. They are extremely different, both in letter and spirit. Although, yes, emotional support animals do provide support to those with psychiatric disabilities, it is absolutely nothing like the support given to disabled individuals by their service animals. Service dogs go through years of training to reach the point where they become a service dog. The amount of work poured into ensuring these animals are appropriate for both their duties and public service is frankly astounding. A support animal needs absolutely none of that training, except perhaps, for housebreaking and basic obedience. I fear that this oversight in legislation diminishes the work that goes into service dog training, in addition to becoming yet another obstacle that service dog trainers face. 

I understand that the purpose of these new regulations is not to make things harder for service dog teams or disabled individuals, but I feel that unless treated carefully and respectfully, they may do just that.",,,,,,,

Psychiatric disabilities should not be stigmatized. PSAs perform tasks just like other SAs and are covered under the ADA.

2. ESAs arent service animals. They are not trained and do not perform any tasks. They shouldnt be allowed on planes because the stressful atmosphere isnt appropriate for an untrained animal.

 3. ESAs shouldnt be on any planes, if they are allowed they must be crated/contained for everyones safety.

 4. Only dogs and miniature horses are public access service animals. Small monkeys are in-home service animals and if allowed on flight they should require proof of training because they are a huge safety hazard and non-domesticated. Emotional support animals should be allowed of any commonly domesticated species as long as they are not larger than a large dog/miniature horse.

5. Service animals should be limited to two animals per disabled passenger. ESAs should either be limited to one animal or two animals that share a reasonable sized carrier.

6. Service animal handlers should only have to provide verbal assurance and answer the two questions: Is it a service animal required because of a disability? and What task does the animal perform? ESAs should require a letter from a psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist, social worker, or similar OR proof of diagnosed psychiatric condition and a signed statement from the handler. 

 7. Service animals should be leashed or harnessed unless the handlers disability interferes with these restraints, in which case proof of other method of control may be requested. ESAs should be crated/in carriers.

8. Trained service animals cannot pose any risk to the general public or staff. 

9. Veterinarian records of proof of rabies should only be required for ESAs as service animals who are trained do not pose any threat.

10. Standards must be negotiated individually between foreign and American airlines.",,,,,,,

Hate that the flood of fraudulent ESAs are interfering with the functions of these wonderful animals.  Have had to educate people regularly on the fines & jail time that can be associated with fake service dogs (but the problem is getting someone to enforce the law). The designation ESA should just go away. 
Why would anyone want to live where everyone else is going to resent the animal? All of us with pets know the emotional value to having them ... but if you cannot get on a plane without your animal in your lap you need to work with a professional to overcome your fears. Too many people using this to get out of paying fees... ESAs need to pay to get on plane, need to pay the pet deposit for housing and maybe all this fraud would go away.
Love the new paperwork I have seen requiring the owner's doctor to write the need for an ESA having to be local to the person - now make the doctor partially  financially liable when the dog bites someone or damages / destroys property.  Just like veterinary health certificates for travel the ESA designation should expire every 30 days & require renewal thru a face to face visit with a physician for all but housing situation (& that should be renewed lease by lease).
Stupid people think I am the one to declare your dog an ESA... NO ... only that it appears healthy & is fully vaccinated & protected from / treated for  parasites. Even then many people I get to see with ESA's don't consider their pets valuable enough to fully protect them in their environment again reinforcing that they are just scamming the system and it is all about the money.",,,,,,,

However, people are abusing the undefined and unregulated ""support animal"" category to fly their pet for free and take them in to restaurants and elsewhere.  Enough!  If someone desperately needs their emotional support animal, then how about requiring the animal to get specific training similar to a service animal?  All of these pets need to be trained, certified, and licensed following a specific set of guidelines.  At least that would stop the casual abuser of the system.  
There should also be random tests of doctors who have written patients letters or whatever they do to cover the pet.  Doctors caught writing up bogus ""emotional support animal"" letters for patients need a very expensive fine for the first offense and one-year suspension of license for the second offense. 
Airlines should require that all pet owners provide proof that the pet is a trained service animal and the airlines should be able to ask for a demonstration.  Right now, businesses are terrified to question the pet owner because the pet owner immediately threatens to sue.
Part of the training and certification system for animals should include proving they can go three hours without needing to pee or poop.  The airlines and fellow travelers should not have to see, smell, or clean up such messes.  Airlines should be allowed to limit flight time for animals.  That includes animals in carriers in the baggage hold.  If a passenger wants to travel with a pet, they should not get a flight longer than three hours.  Actual time in the plane will be longer than that anyway with loading and unloading the plane and waiting for take-off.  A three hour limit should be mandatory.  People can take two or three shorter flights.  If they truly love their animal, they should agree with this time limit.  The animal needs a break.  Or the owner can take the train or drive a car.  No more than three hours of flight time without getting off the plane. Of course, international flights are a different matter. Perhaps airlines could have a designated pet flight (one per day) flying overseas.
These service animals (inc. ""emotional support animals"") should be limited to dogs.  If you need such an animal, don't go getting a bird, snake, rat, cat, etc.  Get a dog trained to provide services or emotional support.  If a person loses their sight, they don't expect their cat to become a guide cat.  They get a trained guide DOG.
Airlines should be held harmless if the gate personnel or flight attendants make the determination that the animal should not get on the plane.  If the animal is visibly nervous, or smells and needs a bath, or seems to be scratching too much (fleas?), or barking, or agitated...that is a pet that is not ready to fly and will be a problem on board.  Deny boarding.
People traveling with an animal need to remember they are not the only ones on the flight.  There are also people with allergies to animals.  And there are people who are terrified by dogs.  I once saw a little girl scream for ten minutes straight in sheer terror of the cutest little fluff ball of a Maltipoo.  The dog was sitting ten feet away and didn't even look at the girl.  She went bonkers screaming and sobbing.  She just had this horrible fear of all dogs.  There are people like that in the world and they have rights, too.
People who actually own a trained service dog should agree with everything I've said here.  People who abuse the system make it harder for those with real service dogs to travel or get around.

According to the American College of Asthma, Allergies, and Immunology, 24 million people in the United States suffer from allergies, of which over six million are children. And according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA), in the U.S., as many as three in 10 people with allergies have allergic reactions to cats and dogs. Thus, millions of adults and children are allergic to cats and dogs, with these allergic reactions on the rise in the United States and around the world. 

What is it like to have an allergic reaction to a cat or dog? According to the AAFA, Reactions include swelling and itching of the membranes, stuffy nose and inflamed eyes.  Highly sensitive people can begin coughing, wheezing and have shortness of breath within 15 to 30 minutes of inhaling allergens. According to the Mayo Clinic, People with asthma and pet allergy  may be at risk of asthma attacks that require immediate medical treatment or emergency care. 

A recent experience that my daughter had highlights the danger. She was on a flight in which a passenger with a dog took the dog out of its carrier. When my daughter, who is allergic to cats and dogs, began having allergic and asthmatic symptoms, the flight attendant asked the passenger to put the dog in its carrier. When the passenger refused, the flight attendant, while clearly sympathetic to my daughter, told her that she couldnt require the woman to put the dog in its carrier. Apparently my daughters rights as an individual with a different disability did not need to be taken into account. Despite the severity of the situation, the dog was never required to be returned to its carrier, which might have helped, though not have solved, the problem. My son-in-law spent the duration of the flight ready to administer an epi-pen. Fortunately, my daughter managed to make it through the flight on large doses of oral medications and inhalers, though her symptoms, as is not unusual with allergic reactions, lasted weeks longer. Further, according to the Mayo Clinic, injection of an epi-pen requires follow-up to an emergency room. This would not have been possible on the plane. Even an emergency landing would take critical time, is costly, and is an inconvenience to all the other passengers on the plane.

The person with the allergy is trapped with the allergen on the plane. Air circulating makes sure that the allergens, such as dander, are spread throughout the plane. Therefore, moving to a different seat is not a viable option, as the dander is distributed throughout the plane through the planes ventilation system. Note also that dander remains on surfaces in the plane for months. 
After the flight, the airline said that for future flights my daughter can cancel her flight and reschedule it if she gets to the airport and finds an animal on board. This is not a practical solution: even if my daughter chooses to reschedule, she may get to the airport for the new flight and once again find animals on board. 

It is one thing to allow a highly trained service animal, for example, a seeing eye dog, on a plane. However, recently planes are filled with many more animals, multiplying the risks to passengers with allergies. I have more than once seen couples where each brought a pet on board; I have also seen individual passengers bringing more than one animal on board a plane. The criteria for allowing an animal on a plane need to be made much more stringent. At this point in time, anyone can go online and, for a small fee and with no real medical evidence, get their animal certified as an emotional support animal. Allowing these animals on planes is not helpful to those with true service animal needs and is dangerous to the millions of Americans, including children, who are allergic to dogs and cats. 

The bottom line is, lacking an emotional support animal can be distressing. A severe allergic reaction can be fatal. Surely it makes sense for the FAA to act now to prevent a fatality in the air and to consider the rights and health of individuals with allergy disabilities.

I grew up with pet dogs and totally understand the close attachment we form with our pets and the comfort and unconditional love that they provide constantly. 

When I became a parent I looked forward to giving my children similar memories with family pets as they grew up. My eldest daughter very much wanted memories like those that I recounted with my dogs.  Unfortunately, she developed severe allergies and after consulting various allergists and researching various hypoallergenic breeds we learned that there is no breed which is safe for everyone; the only prudent decision was to deny her the pet that she very much wanted. Because of her allergies she also had to forgo parties at homes of friends who had pets and eventually had to settle for a desert iguana as her pet. 

In recent years my daughter has needed to fly frequently and has had numerous allergic reactions to animals when traveling by air. Many people believe that an allergic reaction is resolved when a person is removed from the environment that is causing the reaction. In reality, these reactions can persist for several days and do not resolve until the histamine is cleared by ones body.  One allergic reaction on a Delta flight was unusually severe, nearly necessitating the plane to make an unscheduled landing when my daughter suddenly had difficulty breathing. Difficulty breathing can quickly create a need for her to administer her EpiPen. Injecting epinephrine necessitates that one seek immediate medical care. The pilot was already in contact with ground control in order to determine how best to proceed in the event that my daughter used the Epi-Pen. However, the knowledge that injecting herself with the EpiPen would necessitate an emergency landing caused her to delay administering it longer than she may have otherwise. Except for a longer recovery period from the reaction, all turned out well... this time. 

It is unfair to jeopardize the health of passengers with allergies, nor to force them to be heavily medicated, in order to meet the needs of those who are helped by the emotional support of a pet. The current program does not consider the anxiety produced among passengers with allergic and asthmatic reactions to animals as they await the symptoms they know they are likely to experience nor does the current program consider the actual health problems for passengers with asthma when on a plane with a cat or dog.

This is a well recognized organization and test with evaluators all over the United States. The test is very inexpensive and would not be a financial burden on those with service animals. The dog must demonstrate the ability to accept a friendly stranger, sit politely for petting, allow a stranger to pet, heel beside handler on a leash, walk through a crowd, sit and down on command, stay while handler walks 20 feet away, come to handler from 10 feet away, approach another person with a strange dog, remain calm with a noise or visual distraction, be calm with a stranger while handler is away for 3 minutes. The dog can never show any aggression towards another person or animal. If they can pass these items, then they are considered a Canine Good Citizen.  More advanced tests such as the Canine Good Citizen Community and Canine Good Citizen Urban are also available. 

A person with an Emotional Support Animal is required to have a letter from a doctor saying they need an animal, but it in no way indicates their animal is safe to be in public.  These animals need to be tested with the AKC Canine Good Citizen test or another similar obedience and temperament test to protect the public and legitimate service animals from untrained dogs.  This doesn't need to be regulated by each individual airline, but by the Department of Transportation.  Any person with a legitimate service animal will be happy to submit proof their animal has been evaluated and safe. ",,,,,,,

PLEASE!!!!
It is not fair for people to bring dogs, cats, birds, or any other animal onto a plane unless and only unless there is a specific physical disability for which the animal is properly trained as a service animal.
I travel very frequently and I see people who are physically fine, not incapacitated, bringing large dogs and other animals onto a plane.  This so called ""emotional support"" animal is a ""nice to have"" for that person but is an inconsiderate affront to other passengers.
These animals are usually not properly trained as a certified service animal. They are loud, rambunctious, smelly, and dangerous.
For paying passengers and taxpayers who cannot be around animals for health reasons (asthma, fear, etc) and for those who don't want to share precious legroom and foot space with an animal, it is completely unfair that their rights are being violated by people who are selfish and inconsiderate to others in bringing their pets on board a plane.
The DOT has a responsibility to taxpayers who pay for expensive airline tickets to maximize health, safety, and comfort for the majority, if not all, passengers.
To single out a few passengers and allow them to make the flying experience unhealthy, unsafe, and uncomfortable for everyone else, including staff and crew, is completely unfar.
I know many pilots who are very frustrated with the situation as well.

Thank you very much.

I am pleased you are allowing comments on proposed changes to the Air Carrier Access Act from 1986.  I have a different perspective on animals in the cabin of an unventilated transport tube- hours away from clean air.
  
I am not afraid of animals per se- however, I developed an allergy as a teenager to dogs (always had one to cats).  My health history precludes me from owning or keeping an animal in my private domain.  You see, I am one of millions that has eczema linked to asthma.  A recent example, I was nowhere near these animals and yet I was triggered by a St Bernard on a ferry ride to Mackinaw Island (sitting all the way at the front of the inside cabin- as we were sitting in the last aisle because of the rain and temperature; and, Lucy a beagle that shed and shed it's hair all over the apartment I was visiting at the time.  I tried to move away from the St. Bernard and a second couple followed me with their two doxies!  By this time, I nearly stumbled over all the passengers trying to exit the ferry to get away from the animals that were causing me to wheeze, gasp, cough, and sputter for clean air (you see- I don't travel with an inhaler- in fact it expired because I so rarely am exposed to animals).

Only now is research from Rochester, New York starting to show eczema sufferers have a missing protein from the dermis of their skin.  This actually allows hives to form if I am licked, scratched, or God forbid what would happen to me if I were bitten by an animal. Eczema is also linked to allergic asthma.  

I understand traveling with animals that are service animals.  Usually, they are well behaved and you don't even know they are present- I can wear a scarf.  The odds of having a significant reaction from the exorbitant amount of non service animals traveling truly has me troubled.  

My health insurance is geographically located to three counties in Michigan- now I would be faced with out of network health care costs wherever the plane would have to land.  The majority of these NON service dogs, or emotional support animals, are not trained at all.  They bark at other dogs and their humans are too stupid to put the damn things in their carriers.  I witness owners letting them walk on leash in the airport terminals.  Waling on leash creates more of a hazard for people with mobility issues- getting people caught between luggage, canes, walkers, and wheelchairs.

I beg of you to put teeth in the new bill.  I only want to witness SERVICE dogs in public airport terminals and on planes.  Due to my potentially deadly reaction- I do not want emotional support animals on planes.  People are selfish and rude about their emotional support animals.  My cousin's 3 year old son was approached on our property with a little dog.  I had to scoop him up and away from the lady with her dog who was saying ""he is friendly"", ""he is the mayor of this street and wants to meet the little boy"".  She droned on and on about her precious little dog as I was running away with Cole.  She couldn't understand how a child even with deathly allergies to peanuts and animals wouldn't want to meet her dog.  

You need to protect the greater good from imbeciles.  I would go one step further and decline animals in the terminal- if they can't get through the terminal- they can't get on the plane.  NO MORE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS in PUBLICLY FUNDED AIRPORT TERMINALS.  Besides the point they would make a great vehicle to spread a biohazard, or potentially pack unmentionables in to cause harm to the U.S..  I haven't seen animals scanned for residue.  Just saying.

I was on a waiting list to receive my service dog for nearly two years.  She began training at 7 weeks and had over two years of service dog training before I got her.  This training came at a price.  The cost for the dog and training was $9000.00. I take this matter very seriously.  I chose a Goldendoodle as they are as close as you can get to a hypoallergenic dog. I carry with me her vaccination records as well as certification from the Service Dog Organization so the airlines and their employees can review them.  When I book my reservation, I always include in my information that I will be traveling with a service dog. This is done well in advance.  I also request a TSA support care specialist to help us through security.

For those unfamiliar with Parkinson's, we have periods throughout the day where our symptoms are fairly ""invisible"" or barely noticeable but due to the unpredictability of the wearing off of medication, we can experience an ""off-time"" and our symptoms both motor and non-motor are very apparent.  Off times can happen at any time without warning and can be stressed induced.  I have also undergone Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery to help treat my Parkinson's.  There is no cure for Parkinson's.  It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease.

I have issues with balance and gait.  I have fallen multiple times, once at the airport before I got my service dog.  I broke my clavicle and required surgery.  This happened on my way to my daughter's wedding. 

 My service dog has been trained to alert me when there are curbs, to help me maintain my balance and in the event of a fall, act as a brace so I can use her to get back on my feet.  Service dogs are are considered medical equipment, much like a cane, oxygen tank or any other piece of medical equipment.  The airline would not separate a passenger from medical equipment that is needed during the flight.

Mobility service dogs cannot be small dogs who fit on your lap. Mine weighs 44lbs. She can curl up into quite a small space but she will not fit on my lap.  I have recently become aware that airlines may limit and/or charge additional fare for a large service dog. I have seen this policy published on the airline's website under passengers with disabilities and service animals.  I recently had a flight and was told she would not be allowed to encroach on any other passenger's personal space.  I maintain control of my dog at all times.  She does not bark or growl and does not disturb other passengers. 

I know that there are people abusing the service dog policies thereby making it difficult for those of us with real needs and real service dogs to travel with our service dogs.  It angers me when I see a dog that is clearly not a service dog on a plane or in a public space.  They are often aggressive towards my dog and me as well as others.  They are a danger to the public and should not be allowed.

Please do not place size and weight limits on service dogs.  Please make accommodations for us, so that we can travel by air safely.  I have been subjected to overweight passengers, passengers with body odor, kids constantly kicking my seat, crying and sick babies, etc. encroaching on my space.  I have never seen a flight attendant suggest they fly with the baggage because there are size and weight limits, because they are encroaching on my space or disturbing me.  Please do not discriminate against a service dog due to its size or weight.  Do not allow airlines to determine what it ""too big or weighs too much"" and do not allow them to charge us extra for traveling in the cabin with our service dog.

I have done everything the right way, purchased a trained service dog from a reputable Service Dog Organization, vaccinations are current, have documentation stating she is a trained service dog and notified the airline well in advance I would be traveling with a service dog.  It is discriminatory and cruel not to allow a large service dog to accompany its owner and perform his/her duties for the protection of their owner.  

Airlines have made seats smaller and smaller to accommodate more  and more passengers and to quite frankly make more money.  They need to be required to have seats with areas that can accommodate their disabled passenger's service dogs that do not fit on the passenger's lap. We the disabled need the protection of federal laws much like the ADA fair housing laws that protect us from paying extra fees for service dogs and allow us to take them into public places. 

Having Parkinson's and being disabled is hard enough, please do not add to the challenges we face daily.",,,,,,,

Authentic and well trained service animals are a superb asset to society and those with genuine disabilities. The flying public is not heartless and has no problem making reasonable accommodations in these cases.

When it comes to emotional support animals the rational solution is a total ban. It is not possible to define an objective standard let alone implement and enforce policy that is not open to flagrant abuse and compromises passenger safety.",,,,,,,

I trained my dog to travel back and forth to Europe and the Middle East without urinating or defecating in the airport or cabin. This has not been a problem for me nor for United. This rule is also somewhat disingenuous: many domestic flights have delays, short connections with inadequate time for pet relief, and other barriers that result in a travel time far longer than eight hours. Moreover, the eight-hour rule means that I can fly with my dog TO Paris but cannot fly BACK due to variations in flight time and travel direction.

I manage my health by taking daily medication and avoiding any allergy and asthma triggers. Being enclosed in a metal tube with recirculated air with animals is an issue for me. My last trip I had to endure this on three of the four legs of my flight. I didn't speak up about this to the airline as I was afraid the resolution to this problem would result in my being kicked off the flight due to my medical issue. Our destination has only one flight in and out per week so it was imperative we made the flights or our entire vacation would be missed. I stayed quiet, suffered the symptoms and had to fight health issues which altered our schedule the days following the flight.

I thought we lived in a human world where human services accommodated humans, not animals. Now I am finding myself dodging businesses and scenarios where people feel the need to drag their pets along. Don't get me wrong, pets are great and I really wish I could have a dog but I don't believe pets have any business being in public, let alone on an airplane. I know people claim some of these animals to be service animals but in the past few years ""service animals"" have popped up EVERYWHERE. I don't believe the majority of these animals are true service animals, they don't appear to be serving a purpose or carrying out a task required by those toting them other than hitching a free ride alongside their owner on the flight.

What about those of us with animal dander induced asthma and/or allergies? Where are our rights to not be subjected to illness-inducing environments? We don't seem to have any say on this topic and yet this affects us quite profoundly. I can't find out a flight has animals on it until I turn up at the gate to board the flight and then it is me, the paying customer, who either has to reschedule or suffer the health consequences. I believe this has gone too far. Pets belong at home, not sitting next to me in a Starbucks or on a plane.

While there are virtually no reported instances of people self-determining that they need or outright faking, e.g., guide dogs for the blind, or alert dogs for seizures or hypoglycemia, or mobility support dogs, the number of people who decide that they want to bring their pets with them and therefore that they will take the position that their mental state is a qualifying disability, and that their dog's making them feel better when they're sad is a task to mitigate that disability, is substantial - as a person who has invested considerably in a service dog for my own, non-psychiatric disability and who participates in the service dog community, I see this on a daily basis.  

That, as combined with the substantial number of web sites offering to provide letters prescribing a PSD or ESA for a few dollars, where no competent medical professional has actually made a psychiatric diagnosis, let alone concluded that such a diagnosis is of sufficient severity to qualify as a disability (since surely not every psychological diagnosis is a disability, but in the PSD community, it is clearly treated as such), renders the treatment of PSDs and ESAs as no different than other types of service animals problematic.  

It is, unfortunately, trivially easy, *too* easy, to assert (and obtain medically unsupportable documentation for the idea) that you need a PSD or ESA, in response to which anyone who wants to bring their pet with them can now trivially easily falsify that.  And unlike with other categories of service animals, they *ARE* falsifying it, in large numbers, perhaps larger than the number of legitimate PSDs.  I have witnessed countless faked ""service animals"" in grocery stores, restaurants, and other areas and listened repeatedly to their owners overtly falsely characterizing animals clearly not trained as such.

And the effects of this on legitimate service dog owners are substantial.  Inadequately trained or faked PSDs have attacked many trained service dogs, causing them to have to be removed from service at the cost of tens of thousands of dollars and years of waiting for a replacement with reduced quality of life to disabled persons with service dogs.  They have also attacked numerous people, including airline passengers.  Furthermore, the presence of inadequately trained or faked PSDs and ESAs in other public access situations has resulted in tremendous damage to businesses and to distrust for legitimate service dog owners and consequent discrimination.

In short, it is hard to fake being blind, or epileptic or diabetic, or in a wheelchair - and there simply is no large scale systematic problem with people faking these conditions, and no need to impose additional burdens on these disabled individuals - but it is trivially easy to fake a psychiatric disability and even to find businesses to support this fakery, and people are taking advantage of that in substantial numbers.

Those with a psychiatric disability should not be singled out. Everyone has the right to be treated fairly and who is to say a psychiatric disability is not as severe as a physical one. Someone with a psychiatric disability needs their service animal just as much as any one else with a disability. You cannot tell the extent of someone's disability just by looking at them. 

Although emotional-support animals (ESAs) are different then service animals, when it comes to travel an emotional support animal may be just as important as someone's service animal. Travel can cause a lot of people anxiety and these people have a right to have their animal with them. The point of having an ESA is to provide support in times of anxiety and distress. If travel is one of these times then some one with an ESA needs to have their animal with them. However ESAs need to be well behaved as well as service animals.

ESAs should be able to travel in a container or with a harness or leash. The person with an ESA needs to use their judgement as to which is going to work for them. I think it is reasonable to require a container be present incase it is needed but for some people their ESA isn't going to be able to help them if they are not able to be removed from their container during travel. 

Types of animals qualifying as ESAs should be defined to prevent people from taking advantage of the system and trying to bring something inappropriate with them. I think common house hold pets that are mammals can be considered ESAs (no reptiles, birds, insects, etc.)

Airlines should require veterinary health forms and immunization records for service animals because this is a basic safety matter. If an animal cannot be vaccinated for a health reason then a vet can state that on their form. All animals need to have a vet so it is reasonable to require a vet health form. Vets should have the right to determine if an animal is safe to travel. That safety includes the animal, handler, other passengers, and other animals. Health and safety are two things vets are highly trained in.",,,,,,,

I also have asthma, as an adult I've grown out of it but pet allergies trigger it, especially cats. My asthma as a child was severe and when triggered I must use a rescue inhaler or I struggle to breathe.

I regularly travel and the increase in animals on planes has been noticeable. On a recent United flight from Boston to Houston, a passenger in my row got up to go to the bathroom. Her small dog got out of its carrier case, the lady next to me was scared and the dog crawled across her. I had to hold the dog until the lady returned from the bathroom. The dog fortunately did not trigger my asthma, I just had minor allergy symptoms, sneezing and had irritated eyes.

The returning flight to Boston, my asthma was triggered and I needed to take my inhaler due to pet allergies. I think airlines need to regulate what animals can be brought on board more stringently and notify passengers early on. All passengers need comfort during a flight, including those with allergies and ones who need emotional support. Those who need an emotional support animal should be restricted to approved flights and planes.",,,,,,,

No flight attendant wants or needs to deal with someone out of control mentally when something as simple as a calming influence,(dog) is there to anticipate issues and make a remarkable difference.  I understand the need to apply regulations, however, please bear in mind that many times flying to a destination for someone with a variety of issues is the only option they have.

Dear Mr. Jackson,

Please consider adding this language in 49 CFR Part 29:
""DOT Secretary shall issue regulations governing the TTSPG program for each subsequent Fiscal Year under this program 
in accordance with the Negotiated Rulemaking procedures under sub chapter III of Chapter 5 of Title 5.""

This proposed rule was drafted by tribal representatives from all 12 regions and other Tribal Transportation entities with 
knowledge of Self-Governance and the Tribal Transportation Program. Once the rule is adopted, any proposed changes to 
the final rule should follow the Negotiated Rulemaking Process. 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule.

Sincerely,
Denise Michels

Regarding Docket No. DOT-OST-2018-0210, Request for Comments:  V2X Communications

Dear Madam Secretary:

TAPCO is a Wisconsin based, family owned, industry-leading manufacturer and distributor of traffic and parking safety systems that improve safety for all road users. Since 1956, we have provided reliable, innovative, and intelligent safety solutions for communities in all 50 states.  Innovations like the LED-enhanced BlinkerSign or Wrong Way Warning Systems, shown to reduce wrong-way driving incidents by 38%.  New CV technologies are an area in which TAPCO has invested.  In 2019, TAPCO continues to advance intelligent road safety with its new CV Interface, to better inform and alert connected vehicle drivers about the road ahead.  We are excited about deploying these new CV products that can help more road users experience Safe Travels.  We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the developments in V2X technology and the Departments role in encouraging the integration of V2X.

Whereas DSRC is a proven, reliable, and mature technology platform, and deployment of DSRC represents the quickest and most efficient way to begin realizing the expected safety benefits of vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, TAPCO believes the US DOT should provide industrial policy leadership in establishing DSRC as a US industry standard, to eliminate commercial uncertainty and unleash pent up commercial investment and development, bringing benefits of accelerated deployment and economies of scale to municipal and state agencies as they modernize roadway infrastructure.  

Nascent alternatives to DSRC are several years from having infrastructure deployed in even the most densely populated cities, and will require additional years of development, pilots, and testing to occur before their safety benefits are achievable.  During this time, countless lives will be impacted by hazards that DSRC technology is able to mitigate today if it is deployed.

We believe a Department-lead, DSRC based standard for CV in the US would provide the fastest path for the US to commercialize and lead an industry, as well as realize the potential community and traveling safety benefits for all road users in the US.

Sincerely,



Jason Kugel
Owner

Re: Comment Request for Docket No. DOT-OST-2018-0210
Dear Deputy Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy Fulton:
We would like to thank the USDOT for opening the dialogue on the complex and technical issues that are inherent to the connected vehicle discussion. Traffic congestion impacts the quality of our daily lives  time spent frustrated in traffic backups means less time with our families. The Lake County Division of Transportation provides a safe and efficient transportation system within Lake County, Illinois. 
In our opinion, connected vehicle technology should be going in the direction of 5G or Cellular-V2X. Using Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) has a significant financial impact on larger agencies and multiple-agency collaboration like Lake County PASSAGE. Cellular-V2X has the potential to be used in conjunction with central traffic signal system software or Advanced Transportation Management Software (ATMS), in which Signal Phasing and Timing (SPaT) data can be sent to vehicles via 5G for more accurate data sharing in real time.
We would like to raise our comments in the attached V2X Communications Comments document. If there are any questions or we can be of any assistance, please contact myself at jeffinger@lakecountyil.gov or (847) 377-7474. 
Sincerely,
Justin R. Effinger, PE

Dear Madam Secretary:

Recommend that the law enforcement community (such as International Association of the Chiefs of Police) and Governor's Highway Safety Association be included in consultation with the V2X initiative  
(See https://www.ghsa.org/sites/default/files/2017-01/AV%202017%20-%20FINAL.pdf)

Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications should include interface with law enforcement (LE) and security infrastructures. V2X interface could include options for LE ability to interact and command (if necessary) the vehicle.  

Respectfully,

(NGMN) hereby submits the following comments in response to the Office  of the Secretary, Department of Transportation (DOT) s Notice of Request for Comment. 

In a letter from the NGMN board members to the European Commission, NGMN strongly recommends to adopt a forward-thinking, technology-neutral approach in developing the EUs C-ITS strategy. The letter, addressed to EC President Jean-Claude Juncker, calls upon European legislators to reconsider the current EC Delegated Act and include C-V2X on the list of potential technologies that European stakeholders may pursue and allow the market to decide which technology prevails. The board urges that given its importance, the Delegated Act adoption should not be rushed but conducted in transparent consultation with all stakeholders. A recent white paper on V2X technology published earlier this year by NGMN is also included, outlining the advantages of cellular technology over the less desirable Wi-Fi technology.

Both documents are in our opinion indispensable to answer the US DoTs Request for Comments.

""Over the past several years, the Department of Transportation and its operating administrations have engaged in numerous activities related to connected vehicles, including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communications, collectively referred to as V2X communications. ""

Let me point out that the one critical activity the DOT did not do yet. They did not ask the people - yes the actual drivers - whether they wanted connected cars and whether they wanted to pay the enormous costs of the infrastructure to support such a project. I offer my vote - NO - I do not want it and deeply resent your activities to mandate these radios in our cars.

Second, this document discusses whether we should use DSRC or V2X communications. As a member of the public I vote for any radio that will be easily able to remove or disable. That is the best radio.

Third, you need to understand that there is a percentage of our population that are electrosensitive and their bodies can not tolerate to be in close proximity to them. Don't take my word for it, let me quote the Cities of Boston and Philadelphia from their comments submitted to FCC Docket 13-84 where they state:

""The FCC admits its own lack of expertise in the field. But the overlap of federal agency responsibilities for RF radiation protection and the merely advisory status of the Radiofrequency Interagency Work Group often leaves leadership unclear and encourages a pass-the-buck attitude ...
 
The 1999-2000 judicial challenge to the FCCs 1996 rules never reached the issue of electrosensitivity as a cognizable disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. (ADA) Here again, an agency responsible for ADA implementation acknowledges that the impairment may be disabling but has promised merely further inquiry. After more than a decade, that investigation remains unopened. The dockets here have been updated with massive additional evidence of the crippling effects of RF radiation on an admitted minority  but a suffering minority  of U.S. citizens. The FCC and its sister regulatory agencies share responsibility for adherence to the ADA and should replace promises with serious attention to a serious medical problem. This is one area where the FCC could lead in advice to electrosensitive persons about prudent avoidance."" http://bit.ly/1kAYSu7 

A suffering minority, let that sink in. Placing the massive amount of radios and radar in these cars is going to kill them. Show some compassion. What you are planning to do is analogous to a school district claiming all kids must eat lunch in school, the school will set the menu, Thursdays will be peanut butter & jelly sandwiches and every child must eat it - no exceptions. We will stick Child Protective Services on all parents who try and home school their children with peanut allergies.

I do not wish to be required to pay for other drivers connected vehicles either:  if  others wish to buy these vehicles, that is their choice; however,  I object to my money either enabling or coercing other purchasers individual selections.
  
People should not be forced to purchase vehicles with features they find undesirable.  When I want a car without a radio, that should be my option.   Alternatively, I should have the choice to disable or remove any radio feature without rewiring a vehicle.  When I am offered a new vehicle without any such options, I do not purchase it.

I am unconvinced that technologically controlled vehicles are safer than those with human drivers.  If all cars were unmanned it might be feasible to create completely unmanned vehicular traffic flow, although I doubt that cold be so.  As long as there are humans and automated vehicles interacting, there will be disconnects.  Adding disruptive radio messaging is a random distraction that increases the  potential for accidents. My money and my purchasing power will remain with vehicles over which I have purchasing choices re features and control. ",,,,,,,

The LAST thing Society needs is for more people to become disconnected from the ART AND SKILL of driving a motor vehicle.  We'll wind up helpless when the ""automatic"" or ""autonomous"" system fails because the skill-set needed to safely pilot a vehicle will have atrophied.  (You think driver skill-levels are low NOW?

NO vehicle should be able to apply brakes, accelerate, or steer without direct driver input.  Speed-holding devices (""cruise control"") is as far as autonomous vehicle technology should be allowed to progress--and only then if it is independent to each vehicle (NOT connected to, or controlled by nearby vehicles or off-site monitoring stations.)

The Docket Summary states:
""Over the past several years, the Department of Transportation and its operating administrations have engaged in numerous activities related to connected vehicles, including vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communications, collectively referred to as V2X communications. ""
Let me point out that the one critical activity the DOT did not do yet. They did not ask the people - yes the actual drivers - whether they wanted connected cars and whether they wanted to pay the enormous costs of the infrastructure to support such a project. I offer my vote - NO - I do not want it and deeply resent your activities to mandate these radios in our cars.
Second, this document discusses whether we should use DSRC or V2X communications. As a member of the public I vote for any radio that will be easily able to remove or disable. That is the best radio.
Third, you need to understand that there is a percentage of our population that are electrosensitive and their bodies can not tolerate to be in close proximity to them. Don't take my word for it, let me quote the Cities of Boston and Philadelphia from their comments submitted to FCC Docket 13-84 where they state:
""The FCC admits its own lack of expertise in the field. But the overlap of federal agency responsibilities for RF radiation protection and the merely advisory status of the Radiofrequency Interagency Work Group often leaves leadership unclear and encourages a pass-the-buck attitude ...
The 1999-2000 judicial challenge to the FCCs 1996 rules never reached the issue of electrosensitivity as a cognizable disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act. (ADA) Here again, an agency responsible for ADA implementation acknowledges that the impairment may be disabling but has promised merely further inquiry. After more than a decade, that investigation remains unopened. The dockets here have been updated with massive additional evidence of the crippling effects of RF radiation on an admitted minority  but a suffering minority  of U.S. citizens. The FCC and its sister regulatory agencies share responsibility for adherence to the ADA and should replace promises with serious attention to a serious medical problem. This is one area where the FCC could lead in advice to electrosensitive persons about prudent avoidance."" http://bit.ly/1kAYSu7 
A suffering minority, let that sink in. Placing the massive amount of radios and radar in these cars is going to kill them. Show some compassion. What you are planning to do is analogous to a school district claiming all kids must eat lunch in school, the school will set the menu, Thursdays will be peanut butter & jelly sandwiches and every child must eat it - no exceptions. We will stick Child Protective Services on all parents who try and home school their children with peanut allergies.

Technology is not safer than Humans.

I do not want to be bathed in RF radiation when I am in town, and since all of my children and grandchildren live in town, they would be bathed in it continually, and I do not want that, either. Secondly, what you are proposing is far more complex than any system ever designed. The more complex it is, the more likely it is to break down and fail, and this will be catastrophic. I also know from experience that any smart technology that distracts the driver is a hazard. Even the GPS display in many cars is a distraction. I can tell you that from experience. Any such technology should not be obvious to a drive. Third, all smart technology must be designed so that the car owner can turn it OFF. We have a constitutional right to be secure in our persons, and this would violate that. It should also be the CHOICE of a car buyer whether to pay for this technology in the first place, and he should be free to refuse it. It should be optional. The rest of us should not be forced to pay for it. As long as this is not optional, I will not buy or drive a newer car at all. I do not want anything about me to be sent to others without my knowledge, including where I am and where I am going. This new proposal sounds like very bad news, and I am totally against it.",,,,,,,

On behalf of myself and the group, I submit our opposition to connected vehicles. 

Dr. Martin Pall, professor emeritus of biochemistry and general medicine at Washington State University, is an authority who has stated we may have only 4 years before we see a collapse of brain function, fertility, and healthy genetic inheritance, just based on current wireless exposures. His 2018 presentation can be seen online at the Electromagnetic Safety Alliance. Connected vehicles represent an even larger jump in exposure, and so I hope you can clearly see that connected vehicles would be a mistake. 

The European REFLEX study found cellular damage resulting from ordinary wireless exposures which was comparable to damage from 0.5 Gy of gamma radiation, or 2000 X-rays (1). While damage was specific to certain types of cells, the fact remains that cellular damage is occurring from current wireless levels and this has costs which may already be paying. Neurologist, neuroscientist, and autism specialist Dr. Martha Herbert has noted similarities between indicators for autism and wireless damage, as discussed in section 20 of the Bioinitiative Review. Dr. Martin Pall has noted similarities between wireless damage, mood, and behavioral troubles, among them trouble with attention, learning, and emotional processing (2). One can just look to observe we are already paying with a society less capable of compassion and social graces.

If we must be so base as to only use money as reason for denying an action, then another objection is that wireless vehicles will be more expensive. The energy and resources required for wireless infrastructure simply are a waste. The development of infrastructure may be misused for abuse or surveillance, as in China, with or without legal permission.

For a driver-less car to work, there must be infrastructure throughout the United States, leaving no place untouched, and further wireless power levels must be high both from and to the car. Urban areas have already suffered a greater number of cell towers and thus greater ill health, but driver-less cars would require infrastructure in pristine and typically untrammeled areas. Research indicates birds, bees, plants, and other species on which we depend are also at risk; a recent study of 5G impacts on insects suggests even greater damage may result (3, 4, 5, 6). 


At the end of Dr. Seuss's The Lorax, all the trees have been cut down leaving not a single tree and only pollution. Dr. Seuss's book is a fantastical story: let us keep the idea a fantasy.

Hello: Communication technology is an extremely complicated and fast changing landscape. How this technology should be applied to the automotive world, particularly considering the future of self-driving cars, should be looked at very carefully. A decision to mandate one type of technology should be done only if absolutely necessary. In this case, the negatives of a singular mandate cannot be justified. Manufacturers must be able to adjust easily with changing technology in order to create the safest and most useful systems. 

I strongly recommend no regulation on this matter.

If any system is implemented, it needs to offer zero distractions to the driver. There are already way too many distractions in every vehicle for safe driving.No more screens or touch pads to have to look at and page through menus.  Stop the nonsense of telling drivers not to use their phones, yet make changing the radio station or volume level impossible without looking. ",,,,,,,

I object to adding C-V2X communications on several grounds.  First, the public should not be paying for this expensive addition, unless each vehicle owner voluntarily accepts the fees.  I do not.

Also there needs to be a way for the vehicle owner to easily turn off off any system.  The last thing we need is more Big Brother or driving distractions.  

The best way to improve safety is to disable texting from a moving vehicle, and enforce lane discipline, not add more layers of gadgets and bureaucracy.

While advancement in technology is generally a positive for society, I believe that it needs to occur naturally in a free-market system.  As such as the C-V2X or similar technology moves forward, including supporting infrastructure, the costs should be the responsibility of product developers rather than general consumers and taxpayers.  This includes, but is not limited to, requiring auto manufacturers to subsidize the technology, which ultimately raises the prices of their vehicles whether they are outfitted with technology or not.

American consumers should be able to choose whether or not to participate in such technology, whether indirectly via taxes and higher prices, or directly in the form of an ""option"" on the vehicle purchased.

Vehicles built with this technology should be required to have an ""OFF"" switch that is easy to access.  The technology should also be employed in a manner that does not offer an additional distraction to drivers that already have a multitude of distractions that draw their focus away from the task of actually driving.

Furthermore, a substantial body of evidence ( over 10,000 science studies and possibly tens of thousands of studies) clearly show that radiation from Mircowave/ RF (wireless) radiation is harmful to health. and instrumental in many serious diseases.  It also has been shown to impact cognitive function so wireless RF sensors that are meant to prevent accidents might cause as many accidents as they create. Millions of people world wide now suffer from Microwave Sickness and other illnesses linked to RF radiation who will experience serious impairment if radio frequency systems in automobiles cannot be removed.  Industry could also suffer substantial financial losses as well due to any defected systems that cannot be removed and so forth.  This is not only a violation of human right to health; it is a violation of good business practices.

	The tremendous cost to implement V2X technology and necessary infrastructure should be borne by the providers who will profit from the system, not the car owners or taxpayers.
	The only acceptable connected communications in cars is one that can be easily turned off or removed by the cars owner.
	Additional connected communications technology must be as unobtrusive and transparent to the vehicle operator as possible. There are already too many distractions for drivers without adding another, more complex layer of technology that takes attention away from the road.

I am unhappy about the trend towards believing AV will solve all our problems and that fact it is being imposed on us -- while I like some of the features, I don't need AI taking over my driving privileges.

But there must be a concerted effort to keep this as seamless as possible.

Second, privacy concerns dictate that this technology must be able to be COMPLETELY turned off.  This shouldn't be one of those cases where a driver thinks he has turned the system off, but in reality, the system is still performing function X or function Y without the driver's knowledge.

Third, this technology should not increase the cost of vehicles.  Many businesses will figure out a way to monetize this technology.  Those businesses should bear the cost of the technology; not the drivers; not the taxpayers.",,,,,,,

2.  It is probable that the resulting increase in radiation would be harmful to those exposed to it.  I say this because I am aware of the studies by independent researchers which show that cell phone radiation is harmful.
However, realizing that government agencies are generally unconcerned about limits on their lawful authority, and generally unconcerned about health effects of technology, I also am concerned about other aspects of the technology.  I offer the following comments.
I am concerned that implementation of such technology will constitute an invasion of privacy. 
Any means of facilitating connected communications in vehicles must be unobtrusive and transparent.  It must not demand attention from the driver, who is already subject to many distractions.
Connected communications must be easily turned off or removed by the vehicle owner.
The cost should be borne by the providers who will profit, not by vehicle owners or taxpayers.

Citation for these comments directly from saferemr.com 
An international scientific conference was held in Potenza Picena, Italy on April 20, 2013. The meeting was organized by the International Commission on Electromagnetic Safety (http://www.icems.eu). At the conclusion of the meeting, the twelve experts adopted two resolutions based upon the precautionary principle. 

The scientists presented research which found that microwave radiation harms humans and other species. 

The experts reached the following conclusions:
Radar that uses pulsed radiofrequency (RF) causes biological effects more invasive than non-pulsed EMF;
RF can cause structural changes in enzymes in nanoseconds, while pulsed RF emitted by radar occurs every milliseconds which suggests that for every pulsing event several enzymatic changes occur; 
the pulsed signals can induce significant modifications in DNA regulation due to methylation of the genome; 
the scientific literature concludes that biological/health effects can occur at low intensity exposure, and chronic exposure can make a living organism more susceptible to EMF effects; 
ICEMS monograph (Eur. J. Oncol., 2010) concludes there are nonthermal mechanisms of action of EMF (including RF) on living matter; 
experiments on cells cultured in residential areas of Potenza Picena showed that radar activates apoptosis for short exposures; 
preliminary results from animal experiments show that RF is a co-carcinogenic agent; 
RF induces oxidative stress in tissues and living organisms; 
epidemiologic studies find significant health risks for people exposed to pulsed RF; more research is needed especially regarding pulsed RF; 
and the scientific literature suggests that the precautionary principle should be applied to EMF internationally.
Thus, stricter safety standards for EMF need to be adopted by governments and public health agencies because the existing standards are obsolete and are not based on the recent literature about biological effects.

According to the precautionary principle, sources of RF should be reduced to be as low as possible because it is impossible at this time to establish a safe limit under which no biological effects can be observed.

RF sources should be kept far from residential areas. For pulsed RF sources, such as radar and Wi-Max antennas, the distance from the source should be even greater because they cause more biologic effects than non-pulsed signals.

Wi-Fi should not be placed in schools and in public areas since it employs pulsed signals.

The precautionary principle suggests the need for special precaution with younger people and with those susceptible to EMF effects, such as those with Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity, a condition found to be increasing in modern societies that makes people sick from EMF exposure even at low intensity.

1-This technology is extraordinarily expensive.  If a manufacturer wants to utilize this technology, then they should bear the full cost of any infrastructure requirements and all liability.  Tax payers should not be responsible for these costs.
2-Such technology if installed should be able to be removed or turned off by the user.  There should be no costs to the user associated with removal and/or turning off this technology.
3-In recent years, many of the various technological additions to vehicles are extremely distracting to drivers.  Further, they give drivers a false sense of safety/competence.  The result is numerous daily distracted driving incidents--drivers driving into building, telephone poles, pedestrians, bicyclists.  
4-I have purposely put off purchasing a new vehicle in recent years and will continue to put off such a purchase because I do not want a vehicle with a screen in it.  When I'm in my car, I want to drive without distraction.....I do not want to stare at a screen....I already do that all day.  I also do not want to pay for technology I'll never use--my current vehicle has cruise control--something that is absolutely impossible to even contemplate using in the crowded NE US.
5-It completely confounds me as to why so much effort is being put into taking over the activity of driving.....I enjoy driving.  Humans have been driving for decades.  Trying to mimic a human and their ability to drive is indeed a technological challenge and I'm sure manufacturers are betting on reaping large financial gains from this fad, but the effort and financial input required is a complete waste.  There is no way to account for all the parameters on the road in all weather and all conditions, particularly when there is a vast mix of vehicles, both with and without various technological advances.  Such monetary expenditure and effort should be devoted to something that needs fixing--like climate change and environmental preservation and reclamation and preventing species collapse.
6-Once again, we are adding technology to something and creating yet another item that will become obsolescent within a matter of months or years.  The result is more eWaste, more enviornmental degradation as we seek conflict minerals to create this technology and yet more materials that cannot and/or will not be recycled or re-used.

It is a pipe dream that will become a financial nightmare for America. Every meter of road, highway and public space will have to install beacons to simply describe where the navigable surfaces are, in addition to sensors to reflect current reality of use (number of peds, rates of all traffic, weather and so on). Pedestrians and cyclists, as well as rented scooter users, Segways, and such will have to participate through their personal phones (what happens when the batteries run out?). Every sign and traffic control device will have to communicate with all the vehicles about their status (red v. green), stop, left turn only or turn prohibited,etc.  That means electrical power to every sign, with a powerful digital processor and complex software to handle all the communications as well as on-going maintenance and updates. Those changes need to be propagated throughout the entire system, and maintained for decades for compatibility. 

The expense of doing all this, not to mention the vast complexity of it all, make this virtually impossible. There is no way to do comprehensive testing of the millions of devices involved. Errors will introduce a new danger to the public: death by software bug. This has already been seen in the early phases of autonomous vehicles, and will likely only get worse with time. 
Alternatively, the human brain comes pre-programmed for complexity. It already handles all of these situations, sometimes better than others. The communications of traffic control devices (lights and signs) are managed effectively now, at very low cost (compared to V2X). It is a gross mistake to supplant human cognition with a limited capability hardware and software jungle that will bankrupt both federal, state and local resources, in addition to driving still higher the cost and prices of vehicle transportation. Drivers come fully equipped with the most powerful computing tool in the known universe. Let's put that to good use. Let's encourage improvement of that ""system"" where there is weakness. We know that human behavior is not perfect. However, we can do better through education and creative problem solving to make our society mobile and safe. The environment will also benefit by reducing the draw on electricity that will be required to operate a V2X network nationwide. ",,,,,,,

    Points are as follow:

The tremendous cost to implement V2X technology and necessary infrastructure should be borne by the providers who will profit from the system, not the car owners or taxpayers.
    The only acceptable connected communications in cars is one that can be easily turned off or removed by the cars owner.
    Additional connected communications technology must be as unobtrusive and transparent to the vehicle operator as possible. There are already too many distractions for drivers without adding another, more complex layer of technology that takes attention away from the road.

I do not want to have or pay for connected vehicles and their required infrastructure.  Research has proven, again and again, that wireless communication is biologically dangerous.  The only acceptable radio in cars are the ones that can be easily turned off or removed.  Further evidence shows that technology is not better than human drivers. Complete reliance on automated programs will decrease an individual's capacity for driving safely!!  It will not make things better

Evidence documents that many people a very large number, though a small fraction of the population -- are already experiencing life altering symptoms and health problems from existing sources of nonionizing radiofrequency/microwave radiation  (RF/MW), from cell towers, smart meters, wifi, etc, and in some cases also from extremely low frequency radiation (power line type). Each added source of RF/MW has created a new group of impaired individuals, and further curtails the freedom of movement of those already affected.
Our data indicate that for those employed at the time they become affected, fully half have been forced to leave their job, because the impairment is not only to the new source of radiation, but individuals develop new problem s with previously tolerated sources of radiation. 
Combining different frequencies of radiation leads to synergistic toxicity, according to US government reports (like a DIA report on health effects of RFR**) citing Russian studies. Russian exposure limits are 1 ten-thousanths of what ours are  they are doing a far better job of protecting their people, and are probably laughing that we are taking out many of ours, perhaps especially the best and brightest (see below).  Adding V2V communication to existing radiation sources is thus expected to synergistically increase injury. RF/MR has also been shown, in many studies, to depresses critical antioxidants that are required for defense against chemical toxicity as well  so this will likely magnify the burden of chronic conditions with a tie to 
Just as new attitudes toward behaviors toward women are leading to repercussions decades later, so future attitudes may be adverse to persons who participated in making decisions harmful to some citizens, after being apprised of the potential repercussions.
Just as diplomats in Cuba and China experience cognitive loss, hearing loss, sleep problems, headaches, anxiety, dizziness, and irritability  most likely due to pulsed RF/MW-  so do segments of the public, from communication sources of RF/MW.
Oxidative stress (free radical injury) is a strongly documented mechanism of injury with RF/MW (and also ELF). This affects proteins, lipids, DNA and RNA, among other substances in the bodyis an irrefutably documented mechanism of toxicity for low level, nonionizing RF/MW affirmed in numerous studies.  For instance, Yakymenko et al assessed 100 studies that evaluated whether low level RF/MW caused oxidative stress: 93 showed that it did. De Luca et al assessed whether genetic variants that lead to less avid protections against oxidative stress, are tied to reported effects from RF/MW (and other electromagnetic radiation). They were. People cannot manipulate their genes by suggestibility: this is powerful evidence that the symptoms are from the oxidative-stress causing radiation. Belpomme in France showed that affected people consistently have low levels of a metabolite of melatonin. Melatonin is a critical antioxidant, shown in scores of studies to protect against free radical injury from RF/MW (and ELF, and every other kind of radiation  and also many, many chemicals). And RF/MW (and ELF) lead to depressions in melatonin and other critical antioxidants made b y the body, far more in some people than others (a phenomenon called effect modification). 
Oxidative stress promotes many secondary causes of injury  to different degrees in different people. These include damage to mitochondria, the energy producing parts of cells (damage to mitochondria also produces oxidative stress), membrane damage, blood-brain barrier impairment, inflammation, impaired bloodflow (via endothelial dysfunction), histamine elevation, cell death, and activation of coagulation, as well as modifying substances in the body in a way that makes them more vulnerable to autoimmune attack  among other mechanism.
My experience suggests the best and brightest may be selectively affected, and this mechanism provides reasons why. Among those citing problems are Gro Harlem Brundtland, former 3 time Prime Minister of Norway, and former Director General of the World Health Organization; and Matti Niemela, former Chief Technology Officer at Nokia; and Per Segerstrom, former software engineer at Eriksson. I know at least 9 affected physicians, a number of affected engineers, lawyers, scientists, etc. 
Our data indicate that persons who have experienced major electric shocks, or who have had past exposure to drugs / chemicals that cause damage through oxidative stress and toxicity to mitochondria (when damaged, these produce more oxidative stress) are disproportionately affected.

V2X Communications is best offered as part of a tech package, giving consumers options in terms of its utilization.There is a great deal of scientific research that shows serious health impacts from RF and EMF and increased exposures. There are also many people with diagnosed medical conditions that are effected by or caused by RF and EMF exposures and some who would not be able to be in a vehicle with V2X Communication features. A mandate of this would effectively leave those effected at this level a stranded population and without an option to own or travel in vehicles with V2X features. Transportation is a necessary resource. Leaving these features optional allows everyone access to the transportation they need and the ability to decide how many safety features they want on their vehicles. It also allows those who want or need more control over their RF and EMF exposure levels to have it. Exposure levels are cumulative and given the exponential rise in exposures over the past 10 years in all of our daily environments, having higher levels of control over this is for some very helpful and for others absolutely essential. If this does end up becoming a mandate,medical accommodations will need to be made for those with a medical diagnosis and condition that would prohibit them for owning or being a passenger in a vehicle with V2X Communications and access provided them to vehicles without this feature.

The first is opportunity cost and diminishing marginal gains of such technologies. Every year cars are mandated to have a number of new technologies, some good, some mediocre, and some bad. This comes at a cost. Every one of these technologies might add just $20 or $40 per car but, taken together, they have caused car prices to balloon. The ability for car-to-car communication might very well increase safety in some small way, but cars are already historically safe and for many people that money might be better spent on other things, such as keeping the car well-maintained.

The second problem is privacy. We already cannot leave the house without constant tracking through ALPR, OnStar, and such. I do not want to be tracked. I do not want the government to store a record of my movements, in ways that can be facilitated by communication technologies. Where drivers do need meaningful regulation is in the area of privacy controls around this type of technology, to restrict both governments and private parties from using our data without our explicit approval.",,,,,,,

Dear Sir/Madam: 

I strongly oppose V2X communications and the use of my federal taxes to promote what actually amounts to a massive boondoggle to benefit industry as well as a massive public health hazard in the form of unprecedented levels of radiofrequency (RF) radiation that will harm the health of millions of Americans. 

This docket examines whether we should use DSRC or V2X communications. As a citizen I oppose both DSRC and V2X for the two primary reasons stated above, namely, mandating either DSRC or V2X, in fact represents both an unjustifiable corporate giveaway and a severe public health threat. 

More importantly, I challenge the fundamental authority of DOT to engage in the activities pertaining to this Docket. 

By what authority does the Department of Transportation (DOT) propose, via V2X, a de facto invasion of privacy of virtually everyone involved in transportation on our public roadways? 

By what authority does DOT propose to deploy, in the various networks and technologies necessary to build V2X, massive new levels of health-harming RF radiation?

As DOT is unable to provide a legitimate answer to these questions, I strongly oppose any new rule the DOT would promulgate, and I oppose any and all forms of mandated vehicle-to-vehicle V2X communications, for the following reasons:  

Authority  DOT is exceeding its authority. Any decision to transition to V2X cars should be left to the people through a vote or its elected representatives through legislation. 

Safety  A) Software based systems are just as likely to cause errors as human drivers, therefore they are trading one problem for another. Humans may be subject to judgment errors and distractions that cause accidents, but software driven systems are subject to hardware failures, software glitches, software bugs, software viruses, malware, trojan horses, ransomware, hacking, etc. One of these events could have catastrophic effects on driver safety. B) By DOT's own admissions, safety goals will not be obtained unless all cars have them and they clearly state they have no authority to mandate after market devices. More accidents will occur with a hybrid vehicle fleet on the roads. C) Alerts will cause more distractions from the road and possibly cause more accidents.

Health  Another layer of exposure to RF emissions and potential for dangerous hot spots as placement of antennas will not be subject to regulations. It is unconscionable to mandate these radios in light of the partial release of the NTP rat study and the incompleted FCC Docket #13-84 on reassessment of emission standards. V2X must be put on hold until both are completed. 

Privacy  As stated by NHTSA,  ""... the introduction of V2V [V2X] technology creates new privacy risks that cannot be fully mitigated.""

Security  No computer based system working off of wireless transmissions can be adequately secured. It is one thing to have your credit card number hacked and potentially lose some money versus the V2X system hack can claim your life.

Costs   V2X is a wasteful government-mandated boondoggle. The costs of this autonomous car future far outweigh the benefits. The costs to equip and maintain these systems in every vehicle, update the countrys infrastructure to communicate effectively, manage, store and analyzed the Big Data, and secure the system, coupled with the estimated 5 million jobs lost, are not justified by the unsubstantiated benefits of reducing crashes and saved lives. One software glitch can take many more lives. 

Future Crime  Autonomous vehicles have potential to increase crime in the future. 

Economy  Autonomous cars will eliminate an estimated 5 million jobs for truck drivers, delivery drivers, bus drivers, taxi and limousine drivers, etc. 

Conflicts of interests  There have been far too many agency employees leaving for lucrative connected cars industry jobs. 

Safety Act  The proposed rule fails to meet all the elements of the Safety Act.

In closing: 

Any radio installed in a vehicle must be able to be removed or disabled by the owner of said vehicle. 

I strongly oppose mandating V2X in cars and light trucks. All roadway corridors will have significant increases in RF radiation exposure from V2X and supporting infrastructure. V2X poses increased safety hazards to drivers, passengers, people in homes who live along roadways, cyclists, and pedestrians. Increased RFR exposure from V2X threatens nature, trees, birds, bees and other insects. Vulnerable populations such as children, seniors, people with electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), and people with medical implants are at greater risk of harm. 

V2X technology will not make driving safer, but will make driving more harmful to people and the environment, create mobility access barriers, and should be stopped.

Please, stop your promotion of this misguided and unconstitutional V2X project.

This will allow software engineers to work out bugs and humans to become more receptive to the concept.  Software programming and deep machine learning may assist in this driverless lane.  Additionally there could come a time where self driving cars may only enter this lane when the human controls are disabled.  As witnessed by Boeing software not all programming and sensors are correct and need adjustments.  Additionally there is a big validated concern over security of these systems.  There should be some type of fail safe shut down of these vehicles.",,,,,,,

The bulk of Delta's asks were for routes that have a large amount of connecting flow, which can be done over any airport, yet the Department used that same excuse to deny access to others.

Furthermore, Delta has a history of running smaller aircraft to Asia, thus reducing the total number of seats available to passengers and thus driving fares up.   United's 772s have a seating capacity of 276, American's 772s have a capacity of 273 and Delta's 332s have a seating capacity of 200.   For each route Delta flies a 332 on, that's a loss of 26,572 seats to the passengers on an annual basis when compared to an American 772.  

Through the merger with Northwest, Delta inherited one of the largest operations in Tokyo based at Narita.  But, Delta opted to abandon that jewel and somehow they are being rewarded now with this decision.

If the DoT was truly committed to the passengers and not the airlines, it would reconsider this ruling and at a least make Delta commit larger planes to these routes and revoke that route authority if Delta attempts to down-gauge it, something Delta has had a history of doing repeatedly.  ",,,,,,,

For the most part, this proceeding clearly shows the department's commitment to choosing what best serves the general public interest.

On that note, it is very surprising that the department has chosen to give Delta five of its six requested slots. Delta's first four slots are reasonable requests; Seattle, Detroit and Atlanta are all large hubs for Delta, allowing significant connecting options for passengers, and Portland has a very long history with successful service to Tokyo on its own, but Delta surely does not need to operate service from Honolulu to Haneda. Delta being able to operate this route puts them at a clear advantage over the other airlines because they would be allowed to operate in the largest O&D market to Tokyo from the United States, while American and United would not. Even though, arguably, United already has service from Honolulu to Haneda through their partnership with ANA, it is still not on their own metal. If Delta's request for the right to operate this route is overturned, there would still be substantial competition on the route between ANA/United and JAL/Hawaiian. As pointed out in Hawaiian's objection to the department's rulings, Hawaiian would be able to offer passengers a lot more connecting options within Japan through their partnership with JAL, as well as benefiting Japan-originating passengers with more connecting options to the United States mainland, as well as the other Hawaiian islands. Awarding Hawaiian the right to fly another Honolulu to Haneda flight would ultimately benefit passengers much more than Delta's Honolulu to Haneda flight would.

For these reasons, Delta should not be awarded the right to fly from Honolulu to Haneda. Instead, this slot should either go to Hawaiian for the right to fly from Haneda to Honolulu, or to American for their second requested Dallas/Fort Worth to Haneda flight or to their requested Las Vegas to Haneda flight. American's Dallas/Fort Worth hub is one of the largest in the United States, and would allow for more connectivity options for passengers. Las Vegas, as pointed out in American Airlines' initial application, is one of the largest unserved markets to and from Tokyo. Delta argued within their response that if the Las Vegas market was viable, then either American or JAL would have already started service from Las Vegas to Narita. However, what Delta did not account for there, was that Haneda's closer location to Tokyo's city center will help to stimulate more traffic on that route. Note that Delta used a very similar argument in justifying their request for the right to fly from Portland to Haneda. Even though Delta only operates their Portland to Narita flight five times a week for a substantial part of the year, Haneda's closer location to Tokyo's city center will help to stimulate more traffic on that route. If Delta's Honolulu to Haneda flight is overturned, and given to either Hawaiian or American as specified above, then all of the Haneda slots will be more evenly distributed amongst the airlines, allowing for more competition as a whole throughout the entirety of the United States.

Aside from that, the department has done an excellent job accounting for the interests of the general public and it is wonderful to know that as a passenger, we will be able to have much easier access to Tokyo's city center with more available options to fly to Haneda, Tokyo's preferred airport.",,,,,,,

Your article calls for Airlines, public and other interested institutions to comment and provide information relevant to this area of Airline activity and I would be very grateful if you would consider the following information in your studies.

Travel Welfare is an industry expert in the payment of compensation to disrupted Airline passengers and has developed a purpose-built cloud based system designed specifically for this area of Airline disruption. 
The Travel Welfare Compensation system issues MasterCard prepaid Chip and PIN cards which are instantly activated and loaded with funds at the Airport or at the 'Point of Problem' and can be immediately used by disrupted passengers at any Retail store or ATM which accepts MasterCard. The system records all passenger details and can provide a fully activated and loaded card in a matter of minutes. The Chip and PIN cards are open-loop with an expiry period of six months from the time of activation. 
Upon receipt of the card, the passenger receives a sealed carrier containing the card along with the card PIN number. Further to this, the system automatically produces an electronic letter which provides full details of the Compensation being paid along with full Terms and Conditions and fee tables and will be electronically sent to the passengers email address. 

The system also provides a full suite of reporting capabilities allowing the Airline to provide a multitude of data which includes all aspect of disruption which can be exported in various formats and exported to external systems if required.

For Airlines this greatly reduces cost and enhances the Customer experience. Airlines no longer require back-room teams to research and arrange for payments to be made through checks to passengers, the risk element of storing and handling cash is also fully removed and the cards are worthless until activated by the Travel Welfare system. Passengers instantly receive funds with no further requirement to visit banks or make calls to activate a card. The Travel Welfare system takes care of all of this.

Travel Welfare has been widely used already in certain airports in the USA by Icelandic carrier WOW Air, who received very positive feedback from disrupted passengers affected by their recent issues. 

Issuing Prepaid cards to disrupted passengers is a far more convenient method for passengers who are affected by over-sales or other disruption and has recently been used by Airlines to provide passengers with funds to make payments for hotels and taxis. Issuing prepaid cards to passengers also provides passengers with the knowledge that they will not be required to follow up any unpaid compensation as the matter is settled prior to leaving the airport. The cards also have the convenience of being reloadable should airlines have a requirement to pay additional funds and have recently been used to pay passengers during delays in receiving delayed luggage.

The Travel Welfare system, being cloud based, can be accessed and utilised globally and can be issued from laptop, desktop or from iPad utilising docu-sign to obtain passengers acceptance.

The system is now readily available and further information is attached or can be obtained from www.travelwelfare.com or email sales@travelwelfare.com ",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2019-0025-0002/attachment_1.pdf",

It is easier to access, and more convenient for record-keeping. Adding cash-equivalents shows a good effort of compensating involuntarily denied customers, but I do not see it making a huge difference. Obviously some people would prefer cash-equivalents over direct checks. However, what denied passengers might care about more is the fact that they cannot take the flight that they legitimately purchased just because the carriers are gambling against full capacities. I think it would be more helpful to eliminate the maximum limit on the amount carriers should pay, and instead simply have them pay certain percentage of the ticket price, if the over-sale trick has to exist.

the choice of electronic payment is considerate. However, there is risk that passengers cant confirm the transaction at once.

However, it should not depend on that only, the type of compensation should be something the flyer can choose. There are many different situations where cash, checks, or electronic payment methods wont be helpful, and of course not all of them in the same exact situation. Therefore, providing and giving the flyer an option to choose the type of compensation would be greatly effective and helpful. 

In regards to the amount of denied boarding compensation (CFR 250.5). The Department of Transportation DOT should definitely impose regulations on airlines on the minimum limit of how much they would compensate a denied boarding flyer voluntarily or involuntarily to ensure the rights of the flyers. Flying from a location to another is always for a purpose and requires time and planning. Being denied boarding would change your plans as a flyer, and waste some of your time as well. Which is why there should be better compensation rules. 

Furthermore, providing an electronic written explanation of denied boarding compensation (CFR 250.9) is very important. Implementing this would ensure passengers and airlines rights are protected and violated or ignored. We are living in a time where the paper isnt depended on much, so implementing an electronic delivery method of the explanation would give flexibility in obtaining the information and saving.

	The OFD Interim Policy requires lead agencies to obtain concurrence from all cooperating agencies on each project purpose and need, range of alternatives and preferred alternative. The US DOT should, in cooperation with other affected federal agencies, lead the effort in reaching agreement in principle on participation in/acceptance of OFD and establishing a binding conflict resolution process with the agencies in order to avoid unnecessary delays. 

	The OFD Interim Policy also requires all federal agency authorizations to be made within 90 days of the Record of Decision and the establishment of a performance accountability system for tracking OFD projects. The performance accountability system and reporting process should be eliminated or be the sole responsibility of the US DOT to avoid the extra burden on State DOTs by this federal mandate.

	US DOT should note that federal resource agencies require much higher levels of detail to make decisions in the environmental review process. As such, the US DOT should take the lead in reaching agreement with the federal agencies on a consistent level of information needed for these agencies to render their decisions.

The policy and procedural guidance given to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) by the Office of Fiscal Management (OFM) has always been the driver that ensures that information disseminated to the public and other federal agencies is consistent in form and manner thus helping to fulfill agent and principal purposes.

The certain administrative mechanisms currently in place allow affected persons to seek and obtain correction of information maintained and disseminated by the DOT that does not comply with guidelines.  Problems may arise when the two agencies have different interests and asymmetric information such that the OFM cannot directly ensure that the DOT is always acting in the best interest of the law.  This situation can be alleviated if there is a collective action to review the number and nature of complaints regarding accuracy of information disseminated and how complaints are handled by the DOT.

Aligning the interests of the DOT with the OFM through these and other various mechanisms with active oversight will go a long way towards verification of the of the quality, objectivity, utility and integrity of information compiled and circulated to other federal agencies and the public.

There are no negative side effects to having this act pass. Not only this but it will keep people more safe out on public roadways allowing for less crashes and being able to prevent fatal crashes. Along with this but we will be able to help those who need it most by being able to see who needs therapy or possibly go to drug rehab facilities. The passing of this act would keep those individuals in a safer place and allow for them to get better and get back out on the road only bettering our society and our economy. In conclusion the passing of this act will be very good for not only the safety of the public out on roads but it will keep those individuals who fail their drug tests safer for not crashing themselves and allowing others to get them the vital help that they need.

Individuals who have violated the law by driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs should be put into a system of records. As stated in the background, this will hopefully bring more safety to the public and even to employers to ensure the honesty of employees and their own backgrounds. The act should include different consequences for the amount of violations with drugs and alcohol. For example, the first violation should be kept in the system for under two years, while the next violation should be kept in the system for 5 years, and so on. I think the period the records are kept in the system is important because it promotes positive behavior and corrective action in the future for drug and alcohol violations while operating a motor vehicle. The background states these records will have a retention period of 5 years and archived for another 6 years if the violation is resolved. Otherwise the records will remain in the system for 70 years. Again, I think there should be different periods of retaining the records for the number of times the individual has had violations with drugs and alcohol while operating a motor vehicle. I do not think this is necessary for all employers. For example, an employee working an administrative job poses a much less risk than an employee whose job is to drive a delivery truck the majority of the time. While employees seem to have the ability to consent to this act, it may be difficult for them to deny the request for this system of records and keep their job.",,,,,,,

As a person who needs to drive everyday, I totally support Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse (Clearinghouse). However, I have some questions regarding this new system of records:

1. If driver does not consent, will clearinghouse still collect and maintain records on the completion of substance abuse programs and then release the information?
2. Will the information collected be shared with insurance company? And will the insurance rate change if the driver committed drug and alcohol violations?

I recently applied for a Patent for a ""new"" technology, that I ask your council consider in advance of the finalization of the new Transportation Act. 
A major factor impeding the commercialization of electric vehicles is the relative scarcity of plug in type charging stations and the relatively long charging times.  A promising alternative to plug in charging is wireless charging using magnetic field generators embedded in a roadway to couple wirelessly with induction wires in a moving vehicle so as to charge the vehicle battery.  But there are problems with the wireless charging road systems that have been proposed to date. Currently proposed systems involve burying the magnetic field generators under the top course paving of the roadway.  These systems require re-paving of entire road networks, which is both prohibitively expensive and would take decades to implement.  Moreover, repaving an asphalt top course over magnetic field generators will subject them to the enormous pressure of compacting the asphalt, which is likely to damage them.  Locating magnetic field generators in the road base also exposes them to groundwater and road runoff.  Compacted asphalt does not readily propagate magnetic fields, and road paving may be several feet thick, thereby limiting the inductive potential of the system. Consequently, there remains the need for a wireless road charging system that enables placement of the magnetic field generators near the surface of the roadway in an environment that is protected from moisture, paving compaction forces and the weight of vehicles. This technology incorporates multiple magnetic field generators into seam gaskets which laterally support the top course and seal the seams of each paved travelled lane of a roadway.  Examples of such seam gaskets are the “Asphalt Paving Seam Gasket” as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 9,394,650, and the “Asphalt Paving Seam Sealer System” as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 8,439,597, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.  The seam gaskets are designed to form an edge seal for road pavement lanes and to buttress asphalt compaction.  The gasket material is a water-impermeable rigid polymer or polymer blend that withstands compressive forces. Therefore, with the magnetic field generators embedded in the gasket, they are protected from moisture and the compressive forces of asphalt paving, as well as the weight of travelling vehicles. Moreover, the magnetic field generators can be embedded near the top of the gasket’s seam wall,
so that they are close to the road surface, from which the magnetic field can readily propagate. The wireless charging occurs while the vehicle is travelling along a dedicated charging lane of a roadway.  Each charging lane has a top-course that is laterally supported by two paving seam gaskets, one along the edge of the right-side of the lane and one along the edge of the left-side of the lane (as viewed facing the direction of travel). Multiple magnetic field generators are embedded at uniform intervals along each of the paving seam gaskets.  The magnetic field generators comprise permanent magnets, electromagnets, or a combination of both.  If electro-magnets are used, they are electrically connected by wiring through the seam gaskets to one or more DC power supplies.  Optionally, each of the magnetic field generators can be enclosed in a waterproof, rigid, non-magnetic case, in order to further protect it from compressive forces and environmental elements.  Each magnetic field generator has two magnetic poles, which are designated North and South, and which are aligned in a generally vertical direction within the paving seam gasket. For each charging lane, the upper poles of the magnetic field generators embedded in the right side paving seam gasket must be opposite in polarity to the upper poles of the magnetic field generators embedded in the left-side paving seam gaskets, in order to generate a magnetic field transversely across the charging lane.   The electric powered vehicle is equipped with an “EZPass” type device  which measures and compiles data of as to the distance traveled in a charging lane for billing purposes to the vehicles owner.    The EZPass type device can be of the type commonly used for billing of highway tolls. A major advantage of this system is that it can be economically implemented in conjunction with a nation-wide roadway infrastructure program.  Since the wireless charging system is incorporated in asphalt paving seam gaskets, its installation becomes part of the top-course paving process
needed to maintain and upgrade the nation’s highway system.  The typical highway repaving cycle is about 15 years, within which time the entire U.S. highway system could incorporate wireless charging lanes with only a modest additional investment of public funds.

It is amazing the number of times I will be stopped at a light when there is no traffic coming in the direction that has a green light. Another example of you might be going through town when traffic is rather light so you actually get to drive the speed limit and yet get stopped at every light??? Why aren't they timed better? If light traffic is that messed up just think how that translates when traffic is heavier!! 
   This type technology would not only help the flow of traffic, it would help drivers tempers and it would help prevent lights getting messed up because people just run the lights after sitting there for no reason, then the cycle they tripped has no one going on that cycle. It would help encourage people to be law abiding and not run red lights as often as they would know that the traffic flow was better so there was not as much reason to 'cheat'. It would also be an environmental boon to not have cars just sitting still for no reason. It would certainly make the department of transportation look much better. 
   I don't have the expertise to create such a system, but this should be far easier than self driving cars and would spread the benefit around to the entire society much quicker. Why is this not being done? If anything lights seem to be getting worse, not better. 
   This project would greatly benefit the Fredericksburg VA area that another commenter was complaining about. ",,,,,,,

Identifying Unmet Needs in Rural Transportation
Union County Oregon Public Works Department is responsible for 600 miles of roads that consist of 150 paved and 450 gravel. The paved farmed to market roads are classified as fair to poor condition. A vast amount of land within Union County Oregon is under jurisdiction of the USFS. A stable revenue stream from the Federal Government is needed to ensure Union County can meet the needs of improving pavement condition and increase maintenance for all roads within the county.  
A.	What infrastructure issues are contributing to high fatality rates on rural roadways and rail-highway grade crossings (e.g., roadway condition or geometry, driver behavior, wildlife collisions)? Most of the paved roads are losing shoulder width due to increased farm equipment and increased truck traffic. 
B. What unique challenges do rural areas face related to infrastructure condition (e.g., age of infrastructure or equipment, including vehicles, bridge closures or postings, types of freight carried, weather resiliency)? Equipment is failing due to age and heavy use. Balancing the material needs and equipment needs is a constant battle due low revenue and uncertainty of revenue.  
C. How does infrastructure usage (e.g., access to public transportation, technology deployment) affect the lives of rural Americans? Public transportation is starting to develop, but is limited due vast amount of area to cover. Ageing population due not have adequate access to markets etc.  
D. What types of infrastructure projects are most needed in rural communities to meet national transportation priorities such as safety and economic competitiveness? Capital improvement projects that consist of paving and/or apply oil Matts. 
E. What types of rural transportation projects or services do rural communities find challenging to fund? Capital improvement projects that require match. A 6 million dollar projects requires 10.27% match. That amount could be one quarter of the budget. 
F. What additional or alternative methods can be used to identify and prioritize rural transportation projects for funding through discretionary grants? Allow the rural communities to compete for funding with same types of population and road miles. Competing with Major metropolitan areas puts rural counties in a disadvantage.    
2. Addressing Unmet Needs Through DOT Discretionary Grant Programs. Reduce the match requirements up to and including no match. 
A. What resources or direct assistance could DOT provide to support rural transportation projects or reach communities that may not be aware of DOT discretionary programs? Provide one million dollar grants with no match and remove federal requirements. Allow counties to use their own purchasing policy to hire contractors. This would create jobs and provide capital improvement projects the public wants.

Our largest contributor to fatalities has been driver behavior. I believe this is partially due to phones and partially due to non-obedience to traffic signage (high speeds, rolling stop signs, etc). I do believe that we have been lucky that our roadway alignments, rail grade crossings, and intersection geometry haven't caused more accidents but I believe that those would be our next largest issue.

1B. Our largest challenge was the maintenance of aging equipment. However, Illinois has passed the gas tax increase and that should help alleviate our inability to purchase new equipment moving forward. That being said, I believe our next large issue is the safety of rail grade crossings on the county, township, and small municipality roadways. Illinois has programs that replace a select few of these crossings yearly. However, townships and very small municipalities are required to front $750k to $2M dollars adjust the crossing approaches, provide gate arms and flashing lights. As many small localities are very uneasy or completely unable to front those funds, many rural crossings, which these small towns and townships were founded around, remain highly traveled and frighteningly unprotected.

1C. Rural and suburban Americans are more reliant on roadway infrastructure than urban. The majority are required a motor vehicle to obtain their basic necessities and earn an income. Furthermore, the U.S. Agricultural industry relies on these roads being able to carry increasingly large husbandry equipment to plant, harvest, and haul. Thus our roadways, culverts, and bridges must be wide enough and have the load capacity to safely serve those needs as well as accommodate the small vehicular traffic utilizing the roads.

1D. I believe the first priority should be upfront funding for grade crossing protection for local roadways due to the fiscal challenges highlighted in 1B.

1E. See concerns in 1B. I also believe rural communities have trouble funding pedestrian projects like ADA ramps.

Rather than concentrating on spot improvements and shiny object, a program of improving the skill level of on the road investigators and supervisors in the area of hazard identification and basic remediation would be most beneficial.  Look for way to assist this group by providing incentives and funding for perusing associate degrees in civil/transportation at local community colleges, in person or on line. Encouragement in longer term LTAP programs, such as Roads Scholar, with appropriate certifications upon completion are a possible approach. 

Another need is simply for adequate funding to enable the rural agencies to have enough equipment and personnel to make repairs and system preservation.

One last comment:  The application for assistance should not be so complex that the local agencies cannot perform the task in house.

Rural highway departments can barely patch pot holes and gravel roads.  We can not gamble our limited resources on the slight chance we will receive a Federal highway grant.  I also take issue with the grant evaluation process.  If I managed a more prosperous highway department I might submit a grant application to widen and existing road with 11' lanes and aggregate shoulders to make it have 13' lanes and paved shoulders.  If I wanted to make this type of improvement there is research to demonstrate the value to safety to widen lanes and pave shoulders.  However, the highway system I maintain has many miles of unpaved roads.  There have been no safety improvement factors established for converting gravel roads to paved surface.

We are among the fastest growing cities in the country.  We are focused on three primary transportation infrastructure projects which will improve safety, freight mobility and leverage industrial job growth and traded sector jobs:  

1) Improvements to US Highway 97 (and State highway which connect Central Oregon to Washington and California) ($50M - $70M);

2) The construction of an interchange across US 97 at Quarry Avenue. This project is critical for creating a safe ingress/egress freight connection to US 97 at a location that is adjacent to nearly 1,000 undeveloped acres of industrially zoned land ($20M - $30M); and 

3) An industrial arterial that connects Highway 126 to US 97 ($8M - $10M).

An adjacent rail line bordering these properties adds difficulties to each of these projects.

Projects 1 and 2 in particular are heavily used. Deschutes County in which Redmond is located has nearly 180,000 residents which travel US 97 regularly.  This is compounded given that the Central Oregon region attracts more than 4 million overnight visitors annually.  The need to keep US 97 commercially viable and a safe passage for both commercial and passenger vehicles is very important.

All of these projects require some mix of local, state, and federal funding. Oregon struggles to find adequate resources to invest in rural highways which are of statewide importance.  Many of the state's resources are directed towards large-scale highways in major metropolitan areas (Portland) where failing infrastructure effects millions of users.
  
The rural highways in Central Oregon share common characteristics.  They are critical links between the cities (particularly Madras, Prineville, Bend and Redmond) and they all face the problems of safety, capacity, and maintenance.

The Administrative requirements associated with receiving federal dollars is very onerous for cities of Redmond's size (about 30,000).  The accountability of funds being properly invested with the staff time associated with overseeing the grants needs to better balanced. It would be helpful if DOT could provide technical assistance from the application process through the project management (draw down of funds).

1. What unique challenges do rural areas face related to infrastructure condition (e.g., age of infrastructure or equipment, including vehicles, bridge closures or postings, types of freight carried, weather resiliency)?

As with most of the country, rural communities suffer from outdated and in need of repair infrastructure issues. The lack of funding from larger tax bases, like those found in urban areas, prevents rural areas from funding projects alone or from providing an adequate match for federal funding. 

2. How does infrastructure usage (e.g., access to public transportation, technology deployment) affect the lives of rural Americans?

Public transportation is a crucial part of rural area movement, whether it is for individual or commercial use. Generally, the inhabitants of rural areas have little to no disposable income and rely on public transportation to accomplish daily tasks such as obtaining supplies and going to work or school. A breakdown of public transportation can have significant ramifications. 

3. What types of infrastructure projects are most needed in rural communities to meet national transportation priorities such as safety and economic competitiveness?

The most beneficial infrastructure project is one that promotes free movement that is fast, efficient, safe, and affordable. A public transportation system would have to be capable of intricately linking rural areas to urban areas so as to provide a means of expanding one's opportunity for jobs, education, and resources. Additionally, such system would permit those living in urban areas to seek rural homes, theoretically increasing the revenue of a given rural community. 
Newer transportation technology provides an opportunity for extraordinarily fast transportation over long distances. If speeds like those claimed by the hyperloop or maglev come to fruition, such transportation could give people access to different locations and resources that would otherwise not be possible. 

4. What challenges do rural communities face when applying for DOT grants and financial assistance (e.g., project prioritization, eligibility requirements, funding match)?

Often times a rural community lacks the funding and ability to accomplish the preliminary requirements to apply for DOT grants. Take for consideration the New Starts discretionary grant that requires recipients to perform feasibility reviews and environmental reviews in advance of receipt of a construction grant agreement.

5. What resources or direct assistance could DOT provide to support rural transportation projects or reach communities that may not be aware of DOT discretionary programs?

Possibly separate funding to get past the initial studies and phases required to start large construction projects. This would better enable rural communities to compete with urban areas for discretionary grants.

Therefore, the census does not fully capture the importance of rural roads to the national transportation system.  In my experience, the major unmet needs are:
A.  Generally poor design and condition are responsible for the high fatality rates;
B.  Rural and the urban/rural interface areas face unique challenges in getting easy access to the interstate system or urban centers.  The arbitrary census distinction presents an artificial urban/rural overlay to most federal funding programs that discriminates against these areas that have too high of a population to be rural but an insufficient tax base to meet often higher urban cost share requirements (issues are aging infrastructure, mixed commuter, resident and freight traffic, bridge closures, and weather resiliency especially for critical evacuation routes);
D.  Rapid, safe and efficient access to/from rural areas to nearby urban centers and the interstate system is critical to maintain the quality of life and economic future of these lost urban fringe areas that are captured in an urban census block.
E.  Intermodal transportation systems that integrate, rail, freight, commuter and resident needs are a priority.  Projects should also recognize and address emergency evacuation and medical service needs for regional (rural) medical centers.
F.  Account for hard to quantify secondary benefits in public safety (evacuation routes), access to medical services (regional rural medical clinics), commuter times, and freight-also factor in the economic competitiveness of access to the interstate system on job creation/retention.

2 DOT Discretionary Grant Programs
A.  The BUILD program is very helpful but as discussed above, the cost share requirements for ""urban"" projects is very difficult for communities on the urban fringe to meet.
B.  Urban/Rural distinction-often a road can be a dividing line on a census block between urban/rural areas.  The construction costs may be higher in urban areas despite the majority of the project being in a rural area or serving a rural population-these ""bright line"" distinctions made in DC are very problematic on the ground.
C.  Recently many federal agencies have created intergovernmental or inter-agency -- ""integrators"" to assist local communities in integrating various programs within a department or between departments to leverage funding on projects-this can be very helpful as local ""rural"" sponsors attempt to secure funding from multiple financial assistance programs including state programs.  Timing can also be critical as a rural community may be proactive and start the permitting of a major proposed transportation project in anticipation of funding only to find that the funding is delayed and the permits lapse and the whole process clogs up.

Hopefully DOT will use the ROUTES initiative to make meaningful improvements in the delivery of technical and financial assistance to rural and urban fringe communities.

Of all fatal collisions (951) in 2018, head on (126), pedestrian (158) and fixed object (273) accounted for 58%. Wildlife only accounted for 0.8% of fatal accidents in 2018. Updates to roadway condition, signalization, and increased education are needed to increase safety.

Nearly half of all Illinois county and township road miles are in deferred or suspended maintenance. That accounts for approximately 42,000 miles in need of maintenance. Illinois road jurisdictions rely heavily on funds distributed through the state motor fuel tax which was increased in 2019 for the first time in nearly 30 years. The motor fuel tax has seen a decline in purchasing power by 60% from 2000 to 2014. The lack of funds, increased backlog in maintenance, and the rising cost of construction have increased the number of road and bridge postings severely stressing rural infrastructure. Most rural routes were designed and built prior to the implementation of the 80,000-pound weight limit.  The size and weight of farm equipment and commercial vehicles that access these routes have grown and continues to show the inadequacies of current road dimensions and allowable weight. Assistance is needed to help road systems ""catch up"" and provide economic benefit to communities. 

Increased investment in infrastructure and supported transportation systems increases ability for rural Americans access to their communities. Increased funding in rural public transportation assists the aging rural population allowing them access to the community for their needs. Many rural community services are becoming county wide rather than community wide increasing the need for transportation assistance.

Road and bridge projects make up a large majority of rural Illinois needs. Illinois motorists lose $16.4 billion annually on road systems as a result of needed repairs, lost time, and fuel. The increase in postings for lower weight limits adds length and additional cost on to each trip. Updating and upgrading rural infrastructure will allow easier access in and out of communities. 

Road and bridge projects are the most funded but also, the most challenging to fund. The large costs associated with executing a bridge project impact the budget of a jurisdiction.  Illinois has hundreds of road jurisdictions. In many cases, these jurisdictions are operated by one full time employee. Some maintain less than 50 miles. Obtaining the funding to execute a project can be difficult to fund with limited resources and income. This also makes it difficult to apply for federal grants and compete for funding. The experience and technical knowledge needed to submit a competitive application make the process challenging. 

Additional input from local jurisdictions should be included to ensure that those unable to apply and compete for funding are properly assisted. Designing a way for these small jurisdictions to be made more aware and be provided the assistance to apply would assist in upgrading a stressed system. The design-build method should be considered and authorized for projects where the method would assist in project delivery. 

Communities and local jurisdictions need assistance in technical application writing and easy to access step by step instructions. Resources to connect local officials to DOT notices are needed.

Due to the size and staff, eligibility requirements and local funding is difficult to meet.  Local jurisdictions recognize the need for maintenance or projects but are unable to produce a competitive application. Due to the hindered budgets of local jurisdictions they are often unable to meet matching requirements.

Grant writers and specific instructions would assist in the application process. Many jurisdictions are understaffed and/or unable to dedicate resources to apply. Many times, this is hired out if the jurisdiction is able.

Local governments are generally not aware of the over 35 USDOT programs that could benefit their communities or how to match their needs with those programs. This is especially true for the ROUTES priorities: safety improvement, infrastructure enhancement, and transportation infrastructure usage. NNDA would like to leverage its role as connector, navigator and problem-solver for the region it serves, as well as statewide, on behalf of ROUTES.  

NNDA would like to see ROUTES funding available to support local government outreach regarding the program. We propose allowing economic development organizations, like us, to develop a presentation about the purpose, function and priorities of ROUTES that we could provide to our local city and county governments. This would help us to help them more effectively identify the transportation needs of their communities that can be coordinated with ROUTES and other USDOT programs. It would also help us to work with state government regarding any matching funds.

For the purposes of federal programs, Nevada's Sierra Region is small enough to be manageable and large enough to be statistically significant.  NNDA would like to propose the Sierra Region as a pilot for the ROUTES Initiative for the following reasons: 1) NNDA is leading a feasibility study, as part of the Nevada State Rail Plan update, to explore how the City of Fernley can leverage its close proximity to the state's freight rail tracks to become a multi-modal freight transportation hub for existing and growing industry sectors; 2) the region's growing economy has created the need for improving both rail and truck safety in the region; 3) the region's transportation infrastructure needs include both new structures and repairs to support the growing and diversifying economy; and 4) there is a need for infrastructure enhancements of the regional airports within the Sierra Region for greater connectivity to better support growing commerce, including logistics and business tourism. 

The U.S. government owns approximately 85% of Nevada's land mass of 110,567 square miles. Over 85% of Nevada's rural and frontier population are located over 95,431 square miles or 86.9% of the state's land mass. Most of the Silver State's nearly 12,000 miles of freight rail tracks are located in its rural areas, helping to meet the logistics needs of key industry sectors. Nevada's 5-county Sierra Region, that NNDA serves, encompasses 7,009 square miles and a population over 165,450. It is the 3rd largest metropolitan region in the state, and includes Carson City (state capital) which is a federally-designated MSA. The region is located within easy access to Nevada's multi-modal transportation system and a one-day truck transit range of key U.S. markets and deep sea ports. Key industry sectors in the region include mining, manufacturing, and agriculture, all of which continue to grow. Emerging sectors are aerospace (particularly UAS/UAV), general aviation, construction, and logistics. Please see the attached Fact Sheet for more information.

1 (a)  	From 2015-2017 most fatal crashes within our region were the result of hitting fixed objects off the roadway per the Virginia Department of Vehicles Traffic Records Electronic Data Systems.  I would have to defer to the Virginia Department of Transportation on the matter of any specific infrastructure issues at those locations.  Generally speaking, geometric issues on rural roadways are a concern.

1 (b)	Many roads and bridges remain quite narrow and around 7% of our regions bridges are rated as ""poor"" based on information from the Statewide Planning System.  Several of these bridges are located on the primary east-west corridor that freight is dependent upon.  Flooding continues to be an issue, as roadways and bridges have both been negatively impacted.

1 (c)	Rural residents lack the transportation options available in more urban areas.  Dependency on family, friends, or scheduling a service limits the true mobility of those who are unable to drive.

1 (d)	Bring roadways and bridges up to current standards. 

1 (e)	Bringing roadways and bridges up to current standards.  Roundabouts can be challenging to rural areas with limited funds due to the additional right-of-way and relocation of utilities that are generally required.  Public transportation is also a challenge due to costs.  Multi-modal trails along former railways face significant funding issues when new bridges or boring under roads are required for trail connectivity.

1 (f)	Have rural areas only complete with other truly rural areas for funds.

2 (a)	Funding for projects.

2 (b)	Knowing about the programs in a timely manner and being able to afford the required match.  Is it possible to either remove the local match for rural areas or for the match to be determined based on the Distressed Communities Index or some other acceptable criteria?

2 (c)	Engineering assistance.

This does not necessarily include 100% of the rural roadway issues in Arizona. 
		
1. Identifying Unmet Needs in Rural Transportation

A. What infrastructure issues are contributing to high fatality rates on rural roadways and rail-highway grade crossings (e.g., roadway condition or geometry, driver behavior, wildlife collisions)?

Driver behavior (e.g., inattention, DUI, speeding), extreme weather conditions causing visibility issues and slippery pavement, dust storm, inadequate shoulder width, wild animals are some of the common issues found in Arizona. 

B. What unique challenges do rural areas face related to infrastructure condition (e.g., age of infrastructure or equipment, including vehicles, bridge closures or postings, types of freight carried, weather resiliency)?

Massive delays due to crashes on rural roadways after a serious crash, longer emergency response time due to road closures are common.

C. How does infrastructure usage (e.g., access to public transportation, technology deployment) affect the lives of rural Americans?

Arizona has 22 federally recognized Indian tribes, Communities and Native Nations. Public roads in rural areas, especially through tribal lands and BIA/tribal roadways are limited. Moreover, the current road conditions are not satisfactory. Some of the bridges are rated poor or fair. Communication technology has not been implemented throughout the state, especially in rural jurisdictions. These issues pose a huge challenge in terms of people and freight movement as well as their safety. 

D. What types of infrastructure projects are most needed in rural communities to meet national transportation priorities such as safety and economic competitiveness?

Countermeasures to address rural road safety issues like lane departure, intersection improvements, collector and local road development and existing road improvement. Bridge rehabilitation or reconstruction is also critical in many rural areas. 

E. What types of rural transportation projects or services do rural communities find challenging to fund?

Medium to high cost projects that cannot justify funding using data driven analysis, such as bridge reconstruction, systemic safety improvements, intersection improvement requiring additional fund to acquire land such as roundabout construction. Population density can be another challenge for very small jurisdictions. Rural roads on tribal lands consist of tribal and BIA operated roadways which are in need of preservation and improvements but may not be eligible for FHWA funding. 

F. What additional or alternative methods can be used to identify and prioritize rural transportation projects for funding through discretionary grants?

One of the challenges with rural road agencies is lack of understanding, experience and resources to successfully develop a grant application and implement the project if grant is awarded. Grants like BUILD are open to all agencies. State DOTs face a conflict of interest when assisting local agencies in developing BUILD grant applications and concurrently applying for BUILD grant for its own infrastructure improvements. If BUILD grant is directly awarded to a local agency without going through State DOT, it can be challenging to execute. There needs to be a process improvement to address the above issues.   

2. Addressing Unmet Needs Through DOT Discretionary Grant Programs

A. What resources or direct assistance could DOT provide to support rural transportation projects or reach communities that may not be aware of DOT discretionary programs?

More funds, more flexibility in the criteria, intense education through FHWA Division Office (not just nationwide webinar), making sure local agencies coordinate with the State DOT well in advance of grant deadline. Council of Governments (COG) is a planning entity that supports rural/tribal agencies, but COGs do not receive FHWA funds directly in Arizona. 

B. What challenges do rural communities face when applying for DOT grants and financial assistance (e.g., project prioritization, eligibility requirements, funding match)?

Project feasibility, project readiness, lack of coordination with State DOT and FHWA Division Office, lack of understanding grant criteria, lack of resources to cover the cost of grant writing, lack of local (non-federal matching fund.

C. What types of technical assistance would be effective for navigating the application process?

Although travel reduction is a blanket policy for all levels of public agencies, in-class training to help understand grant development process would be very useful to smaller jurisdictions in rural areas. Once they understand grant process well, they can communicate and coordinate with State DOT and FHWA Division Office effectively which can have meaningful outcome. ",,,,,,,

Funding: 

Infrastructure problems in rural areas center around a lack of funding for both personnel and projects. For personnel, rural areas have a difficult time keeping professional transportation planners on staff at the municipal, county, or regional level. A dedicated funding source to help support staff salaries and make those salaries more competitive with urban areas would help in the recruitment and retention of planners in rural areas. 

Because of a lack of funding sources, rural planners are often given transportation planning duties as an addition to other job duties in related fields. The level of need to address the chronic problems of transportation safety and infrastructure maintenance require a constant and consistent focus in order to make a meaningful impact. 

Project funding is often limited to those areas with the highest Vehicle Miles Traveled and/or the higher population. With these types of criteria, rural areas are not able to compete with their larger neighbors. Critical factors such as access to job locations, health care facilities, or tourism destinations should be taken into account when planning for projects in rural areas. 

Match requirements for grants are another area where lack of funds in rural areas leaves those citizens at a particular disadvantage. It has been said many times that if a rural area had enough money to meet the project match requirement, they would be able to address at least a portion of the need without the grant. Alternatives to strict cash match limits or even no match requirements for certain projects would make rural areas more competitive in the grant application process. 

Public Transit: 

With fewer people and longer stretches to travel, traditional public transit would not seem to be an effective fit for rural areas. And yet, this is often the area where the need for safe, efficient, and reliable public transit is most needed. Flexibility in reimbursement requirements for rural public transit is needed. 

Access to technology is often a mixed bag in rural areas. Some residents use technology very effectively because it keeps them connected to people and events they may not encounter on a daily basis. Others struggle with access to even the most basic tools. All use of technology in public transit should take into account that both groups exist in rural areas and accommodations need to be made to address both sets of needs. 

Cost for transit in rural areas is usually more expensive and it takes much longer to come close to paying for itself as a system, but these challenges do not mean that rural transit systems and new start-ups should not be funded and supported. It means rural transit should be viewed and reviewed with different lenses to support the critical mission that rural America requires. 





Opportunities: 

Federal and state recognition and financial support of the efforts of rural development organizations to plan for and implement programs related to transportation 

Develop a nationwide rural road safety initiative with funding 

Reduction of cash match requirements for projects in rural areas 

Eliminate Davis-Bacon Act reporting requirements for DOT construction projects in rural areas 

Support of new start-ups in public transit for rural areas 

Increase of funding for all public transit systems in rural counties

What types of rural transportation projects or services do rural communities find challenging to fund?

In the city of Nolanville, TX we are challenged by the fact that the railroad tracks and busy train schedules cuts our town in half and prevents us from having access to bus service, (as limited as our bus service is- it would be better than having none at all).  The regional bus service, called the HOP, will not enter Nolanville because it says delays due to trains blocking the road will trap the buses and and disrupt their bus schedule.

We need an overpass that would span the tracks and give the community, the HOP and EMS, Fire, and Police an unfettered thorough fare in and out of downtown Nolanville and provide access to both the east and west I-14 entrances and exits.

The overpass would make traveling into and out of Nolanville safer, too.  School buses and foot traffic would not have to watch out for trains barreling down the tracks and employees trying to make meetings and work schedules on time, would not be delayed by another train stopping and switching tracks.  These delays can last more than ten minutes with no alternate route available.  This, and the fact that no bus routes are available to transport workers, into or out of the city, are negative factors that discourage new businesses from choosing Nolanville for their next site.

Identifying Unmet Needs in Rural Transportation
A. What infrastructure issues are contributing to high fatality rates on rural roadways.... 

North Dakota's highway fatality rate is consistently higher than the national rate, and 54 percent (5-year average) of these occur on the rural county highway system.  Numerous factors are involved in these statistics but lane departure crashes on paved roads and angle crashes at Thru-STOP intersections are over represented.  Based on statewide traffic safety data, severe lane departure crashes along curves are also over represented.  Road geometry, adequate sight distance, lighting and other improvements are indicated for some situations.

B. What unique challenges do rural areas face ....

The greatest challenge for a large, rural, commodity-based (ag & energy) state like North Dakota is the large number of road miles needed to serve the industries critical to the economic health of North Dakota and the nation.  The bulk of the county infrastructure was originally constructed well before the general use of semi-tractor trailer transport of commodities, and therefore bridges as well as the subbase of most roadways are inadequate for the loads.  The smaller population relative to the size of the rural road network limits the available funding to support both reconstruction and maintenance.


C. How does infrastructure usage affect the lives of rural Americans?

Many North Dakotans have long distances to travel to deliver commodities, purchase goods necessary for their agriculture and energy related employment, and reach critical medical and other services.  This increases the percentage of their time and income devoted to transportation.  Rural roads, regardless of condition, are the lifeline for many of our citizens.

D. What types of infrastructure projects are most needed ...

Redesign and rebuilding of narrow rural roadways with insufficient structural support for the loads necessary to efficiently serve our agricultural and energy industries.  Additionally, a great many bridges, both major (>20') and minor structures, are often load-limited due to design or deterioration issues, increasing travel time, and therefore costs.


E. What types of rural transportation projects or services do rural communities find challenging to fund?

One of the most challenging may be the replacement of minor structures.  While limited federal funding is available for major structures (>20') generally there is nothing but local sources to support the replacement of inadequate minor structures.  Tens of thousands of these exist in North Dakota and many, like a significant percentage of our major structures are inadequate for the loads necessary to efficiently support the ag and energy industries.


F. What additional or alternative methods...

Over the past eight years, the Upper Great Plains Transportation Institute (UGPTI) has developed an extensive (GIS) database of all North Dakota's rural roads, improvement projects, traffic counts, trucking destinations (oil well sites, shipping terminals, etc.), and material costs.  They have used this database to model the long-term needs (and costs) of our rural transportation infrastructure.  This methodology provides fact-based priorities for transportation investments, and calculates the impact to individuals and industries that such investments (or lack of such investments) can mean.


2. Addressing Unmet Needs Through DOT Discretionary Grant Programs
A. What resources or direct assistance could DOT provide to support rural transportation projects or reach communities that may not be aware of DOT discretionary programs?

The extremely limited ""federal lands access program"" of FHWA has proven to be an effective model with a straightforward application process, solid technical assistance, and significant state and local consultation.  This may serve as a model for delivering additional rural road funding.  


B. What challenges do rural communities face ....

Generating the necessary match is often the greatest challenge for the most rural of our counties.  Staff and consulting engineers, working with elected leaders, are generally quite prepared with prioritized projects.  While eligibility requirements are generally understood, some regulations necessary for major river crossings and multi-million dollar roadways may not be necessary for minor structures and rural roadway improvements.


C. What types of technical assistance would be effective for navigating the application process?

Again, the extremely limited ""federal lands access program"" of FHWA has proven to be an effective model with a straightforward application process, solid technical assistance, and significant state and local consultation.  This may serve as a model for delivering additional rural road funding.

I am also serving as Chair of my local transportation advisory council, I am an interested  party for my local small urban Metropolitan Planning Organization .On the infrastructure side of things, Montana has  many needs  that its needs to maintain as a state.Small urban areas that are not growing at steady pace often struggle as they once did.   I am asking all divisions  throughout the Department of Transportation  to study the viability of as well as the potential of adoption of a new category small urban rural and frontier funding and  service areas.

Every priority that is being discussed has gaps in funding or services.  States, Counties ,Municipalities and rural areas areas often have to defer highway or infrastructure funding.As a result accessibility needs for pedestrians sometimes lag.  We need to follow PROWAG and  ensure that all areas work  on implementing Americans with Disabilities Act Transition plans to ensure that curb ramps meet code, that  community streets are contiguous ,complete and accessible.Communities need to have accessible wayfinding as well.We need to highlight rual to small  urban  community connectivity We may need to study best practices , flexible funding,and discretionary funding options. Some recommend that discretionary funds should be similar to formula grants.

in the public transit arena, I also believe that for frontier areas such as ours in Montana we also need resources and opportunities to take advantage of discretionary grants and funding. FTA needs to know and safeguard accessibility rights of all with disabilities in the United States. For this reason, I am asking CCAM and FTA to study how accessible and integrated community trips are for riders. Transit agencies states and subreceipients should not only be calculating mileage distances between destinations but also how integrated and accessible communities are for transit riders as they access services. Many drivers experience accessibility success and needs just as much as riders. Transit agencies should also be utilizing community ADA and transportation advisory committees and reporting how suggested transit improvements are being implemented . Thank you for allowing me to submit comments on this  Request of 
Information.

The Commission, formed under New Hampshire Statutes in 1966, works to increase intergovernmental cooperation; improve coordination between planning boards and local officials; promote coordinated development of the region; assist with preparation and adoption of regional plans; and develop policy strategies for the region. Every community in the SNHPC region includes a rural geography and each rural area grapples with unique transportation challenges.

In response to the ROUTES Request for Information, the SNHPC offers the following comments for consideration.

Regarding Federal Aid Funding:
New Hampshire is 50th out of 50 states in total FAST Act highway and bridge program allocations, and has struggled with an inequitable FHWA apportionment formula for nearly the past decade. While this funding disparity has affected all of New Hampshire's transportation infrastructure, it has disproportionately affected New Hampshire's rural areas.

	We request that USDOT re-evaluate the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) funding formulas underlying the FAST Act to ensure that New Hampshire is receiving a fair and transparent allocation based on its population, mileage of National Highway System roadways, mileage of Federal-aid eligible roadways, and other data-driven factors. 

Regarding Federal Aid Eligibility:
In New Hampshire, many of the rural highways that serve as ""Main Street"" in small communities are federally classified as rural minor collectors. As such, these roads are generally not eligible for federal aid. However, similarly classified roads in urban areas are eligible for federal aid. This situation creates a dynamic where the infrastructure needs many rural ""Main Streets"" in New Hampshire go unaddressed, resulting our rural areas being less economically competitive. 

	We request that USDOT re-evaluate existing federal aid eligibility rules to consider allowing some or all rural minor collectors to be eligible for federal aid.  

Regarding Safety:
The importance of the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) in New Hampshire's rural areas cannot be understated. Not only is additional funding necessary, but the program should be adjusted to allow for the use of these funds to address a broader set of safety issues. Many rural crashes are due to behavioral decisions (e.g not wearing a seat-belt) and not necessarily about a problem with the design of the specific location of the crash. 

	We request that the HSIP program again allow the expenditure of funds on non-infrastructure safety initiatives such as education and public outreach. Prior to the FAST Act, New Hampshire had a robust program of HSIP-funded public service announcements and other outreach efforts to target the behavioral side of safety in rural areas. However, many of those efforts no longer exist due to these restrictions. 

Regarding the Needs of an Aging Population in Rural Areas: 
New Hampshire is aging state and this aging demographic is changing the demand for mobility, particularly in rural areas. Services such as demand response, curb-to-curb shuttle buses are becoming an essential resource to assist rural seniors with service centers. New Hampshire largely relies on funding from the Federal Transit Administration's Section 5310 Program (Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities) to meet these needs. However, there are far more needs than funding and those needs continue to grow as our population ages. 

	We request that USDOT enhance programmatic emphasis and funding for the Section 5310 program to help meet the growing demand for demand response transportation in rural areas.

Regarding Federal Compliance:
While everyone wants to ensure that there is no waste, fraud, or abuse in federally-funded projects administered by Local Public Agencies (LPA), the regulations have become so onerous that it is nearly impossible for a rural Local Public Agency to deliver federally-funded projects on time and on budget in New Hampshire. Often, rural communities have few staff who are responsible for a great variety of tasks across many disciplines. The ability of rural communities to have both a local match of federal funds and staff equipped to take on the administrative responsibilities of managing a federally-funded project is a high barrier to overcome. As a result, rural communities are at a structural disadvantage for utilizing these federal resources. 

This dynamic will not change unless meaningful leadership is shown at the federal level to streamline the LPA project development procedures and assuage State-level risk management concerns. 

	We request that USDOT coordinate a nationwide initiative to implement meaningful streamlining measures in the LPA process to allow for more efficient and timely project delivery.

People with health issues that prevent them from safely driving need trails and sidewalks to access basic neighborhood services. Funding for rural transportation projects is disproportionately allocated to serve car trips, but the cost-effective investment should prioritize human-powered transportation and public transportation.

Unique challenges in rural areas include: the conflict between planning for density as opposed to serving car-based needs of widely dispersed residents. Community planning for cost efficiency demands that multiple services and activities should be in proximity to housing. Decades of transportation funding that emphasized car-based commuting has led to inequities such as low-income residents living in remote rural areas because the cost of housing is too high in the areas where social services are available. A re-balancing between housing, transportation and social services would begin to address this. Public transit and trails are a start, but they are not the whole answer.

Intrastructure usage affects the lives of rural residents by limiting access to essential services leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Rural areas have no or little public transportation and the dispersed nature of rural housing makes it difficult for local areas to fund frequent public transportation. Health damages include isolation, increased risk of DUI deaths (because the bars are far from the houses), and non-compliance with health care directives due to lack of access to service.

Types of services most needed include: sidewalks and trails, public transportation, innovations such as hypbrid or public versions of transportation network software approaches for rural areas, positive marketing of public transportation especially to serve aging or health-impaired rural residents.

I am appreciative that the DOT is launching Rural Opportunities to Use Transportation for Economic Success (ROUTES) initiative!!

However, please consider the following important suggestions for Rural Communities:

1.) ""Skin In The Game (SITG)""  should be viewed from the Federal DOT as a focus priority, flagged for any communities whom are willing to invest their own local dollars, first, to address DOT infrastructure needs. What better story to tell, than the local's have raised X dollars to invest into their own infrastructure needs, before DOT or State dollars follow?  

2.) Aviation infrastructure (Terminal Buildings, Fuel Farms and Hangars) and infrastructure to support the aviation environment (highways to the runway, broadband to the runway and road access to the Terminal building) should not be forgotten, as they are NOT currently funded by the FAA through AIP/CIP!! 

3.) Do away with the Federal funding option of ""Bike Trails"" for States, Counties and Cities, when the dollars are competing with highway infrastructure that is substandard, due to pot holes in our highways!!

4.) Do away with ""Noise/sound Barriers"" with Federal funding for States, Counties and Cities, when our Rural communities are operating with the following infrastructure substandards: state highways in rural areas, bridges, aviation infrastructure (lack of publicly available basic's - fuel and terminal)

Rural Opportunities to Use Transportation for Economic Success

The New York State Association for Rural Health (NYSARH) appreciates this opportunity to comment on the proposed ROUTES regulations.
NYSARH supports designing rural roads and bridges to accommodate multiple modes of transportation including horses, bicycles, snowmobiles and pedestrians.  A common limitation of rural roads is the lack of adequate shoulders.  We recommend that federal resources be targeted to support widening rural roads when they provide funding for upgrades.  
Support for widening roads will likely involve some acquisition of property along the right of way and drainage improvements as well as the increased width of gravel, base and pavement.  We believe these investments will enhance the safety of rural roads while providing more options for recreational use, both of which will enhance the health and wellness of rural populations.
We believe that wider rural roads will also enhance the economic success of rural communities by improving access and safety.
About Us:
The New York State Association for Rural Health (NYSARH) is a not-for-profit, non-partisan, grassroots organization working to improve the health and well-being of rural New Yorkers and their communities.  NYSARH membership includes representatives of all facets of the rural health care industry, as well as individuals and students.  On many different levels, NYSARH serves individuals, consumers, non-profit organizations, government agencies and officials, health care facilities, emergency medical service providers, long-term care organizations, businesses, universities, foundations, associations, and other stakeholders in rural health.

Many rural counties lack the ability to meet federal cost share standards set in grants, lack planning staff to develop grants, and don't have the vision for how to make their communities more livable to younger demographics, yet these same places are suffering from health related issues due to inactive lifestyles and aging populations that shouldn't be driving. By providing places to walk and bicycle and access to transit, rural communities would benefit from having better access for those unable to drive and those who would choose to drive less if given the opportunity to do so safely. 

Rural areas would benefit from reduced speed limits and a more diligent focus on safety culture; personal choices to be responsible road users. Rural areas suffer from distracted and impaired drivers,including elderly that shouldn't be allowed to drive any longer.A program should be developed to help rural areas address these issues.

In terms of economic development, reduced emissions, affordable housing for city workers, access to jobs and education for rural residents, this type of regional passenger rail will be transformative and cost-effective. There is no reason in 2020 that the US countryside should be backward and economic depressed. Passenger rail service can be restored on lines where it used to run and where freight trains run today, offering early return on investment. The Housatonic Line between New York City and Pittsfield, MA is an excellent example: full daily service can be restored for about $250 million, and would bring an estimated $1 billion in economic benefit to Berkshire County alone over 10 years. 

I am a business owner who started the Train Campaign (www.traincampaign.org) in order to improve the economic outlook for this part of rural America, the western region of Massachusetts.

On behalf of the New River Valley Regional Commission, located in southwest Virginia, representing the counties of Floyd, Giles, Montgomery, and Pulaski, and the City of Radford, rural communities often face the following barriers on addressing unmet transportation infrastructure needs:

1) Lack of local staff to provide technical assistance with the design and cost estimation to improve project readiness
2) Performance driven criteria - safety and mode choice quantities don't compare against statewide figures
3) Bridge replacement, especially those that also carry public utilities
4) Expanding mode choice, public transit, carpool/vanpool, and broadband
5) Improving dangerous intersections, sight distance and the addition of turn lanes
6) Improving substandard roadway widths and surface conditions

Furthermore, the Regional Commission supports the comments provided by the National Association of Development Organizations.  Particularly the efforts to continuously improve collaboration and consistency between local, regional, and statewide transportation planning and implementation initiatives.

Again, thank you for the opportunity to provide comment.  Please reach out to our organization if we can help to improve transportation in the rural communities of southwest Virginia.

I'm not handicapped and it is difficult for me to get down the narrow aisles to get to the lavatory, much less turn around in it.  I would be most pleased if the DOT also did something about the crowded seating, which is torture on a long flight. I only fly as a last resort under these deplorable conditions.",,,,,,,

I actually am not going on a family trip to HI in 2020 and part of the reason is this problem.  I once had to hold it because I could not make it to the restroom.  I felt sorry for making the mess and it was embarrassing to have to go on myself.  My father in law is disabled as well and has the same issue.  He has resulted in wearing adult diapers.  If this federal law were to pass and be followed it would be a huge relief to both of us.  As well as those that travel with us.",,,,,,,

I'm spinal cord injury (SCI) disabled traveler were I'm paralized and travel on airplanes often. I have to stop drinking fluids the night before my flight witch makes my body dehydrated and is very dangerous for a SCI person. Most of us with SCI have Foley & Leg bags to empty, and some of us have to self-cath, and if we hold our fluids, we'll get internal medical complications that I won't discuss on here. It should not be about revenue & seats, it should be about health & safety of the passengers without discrimination of the disabled community in not allowing us to use the bathrooms on flights just like every able bodied passenger.",,,,,,,

Airlines have many cabin interior options to choose from, and they do not always install the most disability-friendly lavatories
As a person with a physical disability who travels a lot and as a person with kids who also have a disability, i find the small bathrooms quite inaccessible. Larger spaces at least with the ability to move is definitely an urgent need. Accessible air travel is a basic right.
The grab bars need to be in a convenient spot. The space is small and difficult to maneuver. There should be more space for a partner or caregiver to assist a wheelchair user in transferring to the toilet. There should also ve more space for the aisle wheelchair to actually enter the bathroom space. The way the door opens and shuts needs to be relooked at. Inward opening doors are not safe or easily managed by PWD.
