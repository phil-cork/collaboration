I am writing this letter to express my full support for Boutique Air. As a native of Chadron, I moved away since 2014, I have seen how Boutique Air has made it easy for myself to go and visit my 68 year old mother and to travel back and forth from Boise, Idaho to Chadron. I can not imagine not having the service as it only takes me 5 hours of travel time with connecting in Denver on United. 

Boutique Air also offers the vouchers that I buy for my sister and I and really make it easy to travel if needing to fly to Chadron and take my mother to medical visits in Denver for a day. 

Please consider keeping Boutique Air as the carrier for Chadron as it is imperative to the lives and folks attached to this town.

In this I mean that when planning infrastructure and surroundings, important stopovers for at risk species be implemented. Possibly even through tax credits offered to the industrial zones normally surrounding interstate and urban transportation. Many areas of sciences focused on ecological conservation have been studying the habitual migrations of birds, insects such as bees, butterflies, etc. with great concern regarding the loss of the species’ impacts on environmental sustainability. Human urbanization has eroded the natural homes of critical species. I suggest collaborating with other agencies involved in environmental protections, wildlife, and national parks in a wide conservation effort that not only rebuilds human transportation and infrastructure for the future, but also builds and includes sustainable migration routes with beneficial ecological parks and stopovers (could be funded by private companies if included in a point system measure or such) that can aid critical species and lessen the stress civilization places on such creatures.

We don’t necessarily need monkey bridges here that I know of, but land bridges, conservation areas that include the vital milkweed for butterflies along their routes (for example) could make a huge difference. It would also validate the careers many have focused on finding ways to do just such a thing, and validate the concern that we should have for our planet as a people and a culture.",,,,,,,

Dear Sir/Madam,

Thank you for your time.

I am addressing my advocacy of statutory provision 49 U.S.C. 41704 detailed in this proposed rule. As a frequent traveler, I have experienced a few lengthy baggage delay incidents where I was not entitled to a refund. I echo the same sentiment that some commentators had in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. It is a huge inconvenience when baggage delivery time is significantly delayed. It can be quite a stressful experience for customers especially if there is an urgent event to attend or if prompt access to luggage belongings is needed. I understand that some carriers may need more time for baggage delivery, but I agree with The American Society of Travel Advisors and Consumers Union that there should be a threshold to the delay period. I hope the new proposed guidelines would compel airlines to minimize baggage delay issues.

According to Reuters, U.S. airline passengers paid $5.8 billion dollars in baggage fees in 2019 (Shepardson and Bartz). Although the airlines will lose out on some profits by issuing refunds for baggage delays, I think the proposed rule would benefit the airlines’ reputation and long-term revenue-generating ability while improving customer satisfaction. As a consumer, I will feel more assured knowing that the airlines are held accountable in the event of a prolonged luggage delay and that I would receive a refund.

Thank you very much.

Travelers using checked baggage services rely on the airline to provide the service in a timely manner. It is simply fair that if the service was not completed in a timely manner, the consumer should be compensated with a refund. I have had the experience during a business trip where there was a significant delay receiving checked baggage that resulted in additional costs for transportation from the airport to the business destination and costs of missed business opportunities. In my opinion, the points made to set the threshold at 12-hour deadline for domestic flights and 25-hour deadline for international flights are valid. It would be sufficient time to return baggage to consumers and it would definitely incentivize carriers to return bags as soon as possible because if they miss the deadline then they would have to refund monies to the consumer. There should be a system in place to verify the length of the delay and that the cause was not of the passenger’s negligent actions. Allowing carriers to choose options of when a delayed bag would be considered delivered is reasonable and effective. It gives the carrier enough flexibility to provide the service in reasonable time and cost effectively. This will ensure that consumers are treated fairly in the case of baggage delay. Carriers should notify passengers via the source in which they checked the bag: phone call, text or email. If this was not already provided, it should be information that is obtained before checking bags. The passenger must be promptly notified of any baggage delay and should be given the opportunity of how they’d like the baggage delivered. Specifying which method to use to provide the refund would negatively impact carriers/consumers. The refund should be made in the method in which the consumer paid. I think it is fair that a refund be issued after the delay in the delivery of the bag has exceeded the deadline and after the consumer has notified the airline of the delay. This would make airlines more accountable of baggage issues and in turn result in better service and happier consumers. Same goes for ancillary services. For example, if I booked a flight and paid ancillary fees for Wi-Fi service and seat placement but the airline cancels that flight and puts me on a flight that is over booked and my expected seat is unavailable and there is no Wi-Fi on the new flight, then I should be entitled to a refund for the ancillary service that was not provided.

We strongly believe 25 hours is not a feasible time frame for a missed bag to arrive back into USA. We propose if the time frame could be increased to 72 hours instead of 25 hours before we have to reimburse the amounts charged for excess baggage.

I would like to remember the DOT that this NPRM is to protect taxpayers from abuses by the airlines and not to allow airlines to continue leveraging the limited choice consumers/taxpayers have to continue screwing them over.

RE: Refunding Fees for Delayed Checked Bags and Ancillary Services That Are Not Provided 

Docket No. DOT-OST-2016-0208

Comments of Emirates Airline

Emirates appreciates the opportunity to provide comments in response to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), “Refunding Fees for Delayed Checked Bags and Ancillary Services That Are Not Provided,” issued on July 21, 2021.

As a member of IATA, we fully support the comments made to the NPRM and would also like to use the opportunity to highlight some additional points of particular importance to Emirates. 

Emirates’ focus on service excellence, innovation, and safety means our passengers get superior service both in the air and on the ground. Ensuring that customers receive their checked luggage and ancillary service purchases in a timely and efficient manner is central to the Emirates customer service proposition. Therefore we also broadly support the goals of this congressionally-mandated rulemaking to ensure that customers receive timely refunds for delayed checked baggage and ancillary services that are not provided. 

However, we would also like to point out the importance of recognising that airlines are afforded the necessary flexibility to provide service and service recovery within their operational constraints. IATA, in its response, lists some of these operational constraints in detail. In Emirates’ case, this is particularly important as the flights we operate to the USA are ultra-long haul sectors. A considerable number of our US-bound itineraries also involve a long haul or ultra-long haul flight into Dubai (DXB), meaning the combined journey time can easily exceed 24 hours. Also, many of our US destinations are served by a daily flight and in what may be an extended COVID-19 recovery phase, some US destinations may be served less. The combination of circumstances - ultra long haul sectors, a possible connection at an intermediate point and fewer frequencies – would make it impossible for any airline to reunite a delayed bag with a passenger within a 25-hour timeframe. Ideally, it would be taken into account that the length of an “international flight” varies considerably and in cases of journey times of 10 hours or more, the refund deadline applicable to such flights would be extended to for example 72 hours with the clock starting when the passenger files a mishandled baggage report upon arrival.

Furthermore we firmly believe force majeure events, such as weather or airport baggage system failures, be exempted as these are outside the control of the airline. Interline journeys involving more than one carrier should also be considered, whereby the refund should ideally be the responsibility of the airline that collected the ancillary revenue, irrespective of the ticketing carrier. 

In summary, we ask the Department to carefully consider the more general concerns IATA has raised and as well as the specific concerns mentioned above. 

Emirates was one of the largest non-US airlines operating to the US in terms of seat capacity prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, with 100 weekly flights on wide-body aircraft to/from 12 airports in the US, and having carried over 4.1 million passengers and 144,000 tonnes of cargo on these flights in 2019. Emirates currently operates 72 weekly flights to 12 airports in the US - Boston, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Newark (via Athens), New York JFK (including a daily flight via Milan), Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Perhaps this data will also assist policymakers in creating plans regarding COVID-19 containment as they will have a larger survey to recognize where people are traveling in the country and compare that to COVID-19 rates. Regardless of what this data is going to be used for in the future, the data from 1993 has been extremely useful.

I affirm that it does seem to be an efficient update, as well as an improvement on actual data validation process. In addition, it's important to note that this passenger data will prove even more critical as airlines are tracking specific vaccination requirements of their passengers.

However, after reading the proposed rule for the revision of the O&D Survey, I agree that the current survey is out of date and needs revisions. Air transportation is a crucial means of travel and this survey provides DOT with the information to make necessary adjustments based on consumer preferences. Since the O&D survey was created in the 1960s, it includes procedures and practices that are desperately out of date such as handwritten records and manual accounting. This has created issues in determining key information such as date of travel, true origin and destination of passengers thus making the data collected obsolete. The proposed revision is a simple and modern way to revise a historically beneficial system to better assess consumer preferences. I am actually surprised that this proposed rule has not happened sooner. This will be important for the future of air travel especially keeping in mind COVID-19 restrictions and the potential to have to prove vaccination records prior to flying. Hopefully, a modern standardized data collection system could also be used to help create efficient transport experiences for consumers.",,,,,,,

I am an independent living specialist representing and and employed by North Central Independent Living inBlack Eagle Montana. I wish to leave these comments for the air carrier access committee meeting happening in September 2021. In north central Montana, many of us with disabilities have limited access  to airline options. We ask that the
airlines work with stateDepartments of Transportation to  ensure   that airline  accessibility   is  of highest  priority  in getting   to and from airports once in airports  and on airplanes.   We need to ensure   that  Essential Air Service communities  and smaller  connector  airlines  maximize  on boarding,  in plane,  and  deboarding  accessibility. NCILS  supports  efforts  to maximize  on boarding access in airline restrooms   with proper  turning  radii. NCILS  supports     modernizing technology   which  supports and allows  for independent  seat transfers where possible.  NCILS  supports  the  research   work of  the Access Board and wheelchair  securement on airplanes  .  NCILS also hopes that  and employees  are tracking  and  reducing  consumer complaints  regarding  damages to  wheelchairs ,  death or injury to comfort  animals  , reasonable   accommodations  in travel and effective  communications. Airlines must work the TSA  to ensure accessible , timely,as well as humane accommodation regarding the TSA and security. The Air  Carrier Access Act and its  amendments should   include  guidelines  for all including  chemical sensitivities  and allergies. 
 Online  travel opportunities  should  also be accessible  to all.",,,,,,,

After reviewing the information found at Docket No. DOT–OST–2019–0180, our organization has a few concerns we hope the rulemaking stakeholders will take into consideration as they plan for accessible lavatories on single-aisle aircraft.

First, the proposed rule states that “single-aisle aircraft with 125 or more passenger seats would have at least one lavatory with a number of accessibility features, including…call buttons…”  While this is an important safety feature, the document does not specify if call buttons would only for emergencies, or if flight staff would be expected to regularly assist disabled passengers in the lavatory.  Without individualized training, flight staff and passengers would be at serious risk for injury if an individual requires physical assistance to transfer from an on-board wheelchair (OBW) to the toilet and back.  We suggest that airlines make it clear to passengers at the time of ticket purchase that the call buttons are only for unexpected emergencies and that flight staff cannot provide toileting assistance aside from pushing the OBW from the individuals seat to the lavatory.

Second, the suggested lavatory layout specifies a “…stand-and-pivot maneuver from the OBW to the toilet seat…”, must be ensured.  While this is critical for access, the rulemaking bodies need to more explicitly acknowledge that many disabled individuals cannot stand or bear weight.  Therefore, the proposed layout improves accessibility, but could not be considered fully accessible in good faith, as some needs are not addressed.  We strongly encourage the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, the Office of the Secretary and Department of Transportation to consider the feasibility of adding adult changing tables and hoyer lifts to ensure full accessibility and equity for passengers of differing abilities and needs.

Our last primary concern deals with the features of the updated OBW requirements.  While we commend the safety features mentioned, such as the “torso and leg restraints to ensure stability and prevent injury,” we would appreciate more information on the proposed torso restraint.  For many individuals with muscle weakness, lap belts are not sufficient restraints and an individual requiring more support could not safely utilize the OBW if that was the only available torso restraint.  We encourage the OBW requirements to ensure varying styles of torso restraints are available and compatible with the new OBWs.  

We strongly support the inclusion of people with disabilities in every stage of this initiative to ensure on-board wheelchairs and aircraft lavatories are fully accessible.  Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback, and for continuing to work toward a future where air travel is accessible for all.

I'm a disabled traveler. I travel often for work and pleasure. I often travel solo. I cannot walk at all. I use an aisle wheelchair to get onboard. I'm able to make transfers on my own (i.e. transfer to the airplane seat, to a toilet). When I travel on flights longer than 2 hours I have to dehydrate myself in order to fly because I know unless its an international flight, I won't be able to use the restroom - and that's not OK. When I say dehydrate myself I mean I won't drink anything for at least 2 hours prior to my flight and I have to time when I use the restroom before I board a flight (as close to boarding as possible)- which can be thrown off by delays, gate changes etc.  I can't believe we are going into 2022 and accessible lavatories on airplanes are acceptable. We don't think its acceptable for the general public to not have access to a lavatory in a plane - so why is it OK for disabled travelers not be able to have access to a toilet when they fly?",,,,,,,

Between UA and DL is to terminate AA in the region.

Although there are airlines such as American and United that service trips from other international airports such as Atlanta or Chicago to the regional airport in Green Bay, I think that the city of Green Bay deserves an international airport of their own. Additionally, I think it's unfair for those who live and are visiting Green Bay to pay ticket fares that are much higher than the average ticket fare to travel.

Be sure to figure out how you are going to curate it.  I suggest you divide it into sections and appoint an editorial group for each area to avoid direct pressure and criticism for inclusion of some item or paper or report over another.   As is the practice at the Access Board - a balance of industry and consumers should be in each group. 

I also suggest that the groups consider organizing the results into: 
> Highlighted Items  (documents, standards, videos )
> Summary Items  (things the review or summarize many other documents or sources)
> Full collection of items  (a searchable general collection of everything that might be useful

I also suggest that item be tagged for easy searching and filtering. 
- one key tag should be date - (since the collection will be useful for a long time - and the field will be moving quickly so documents can get out of date quickly)

Looking forward to it. ",,,,,,,

By including access early in the process of AV development there is a greater likelihood that design standards will include access in the future.  
There should be multiple initiatives for qualitative research since every disability is unique.  One thing about AV is that there will be a decrease in human interaction.  People with disabilities and transportation are anything but consistent.  There are so many variables to consider that are outside of the realm of general public transportation (snow piles, broken warning tiles) that there needs to be some a place to find out where and what these variable are then devise ways to work through them. This type of resource hub could be useful if information is constantly being updated and includes as much possible qualitative research so that people with all different types of disabilities have a chance to be included.  There will need to be a strong information management piece.

There will be challenges in finding enough good, credible information then putting it into categories that are easily searchable.  Finding relevant information and making it easy to locate could be challenging because each type of disability needs to be considered for each aspect of research.  ",,,,,,,

It would be helpful if applicable information could be searched based on the disability experienced.  For example, as an ADA Coordinator, if a resident who is blind asked me where they could get more information about AVs, and planning, design and regulations related to vision impairments, I could refer them to a specific location on the website.

A LOT of attention should be paid to infrastructure.  Most locations in the country have the bare minimum of Accessible parking spaces.  Most locations also lack curb ramps at every corner and very few have locations where individuals with disabilities (or anyone) can safely be picked up or dropped off on a busy roadway.  In addition, most homes in this country are not designed with Accessibility in mind (see research on ""Visitability"").  In many older neighborhoods there are no sidewalks.  Once more individuals with disabilities can use AVs for transportation, a LOT MORE people will be able to go out and about and enjoy community activities, as well as visit friends and family.  Destinations will need to have Accessibility elements. 
 
Since it would be hard for any municipality to rapidly add more Accessible parking and Accessible drop-off and pick-up locations to meet the increased demand, it makes sense that auto manufacturers would have to have a certain percentage of their line designed with ramps, which can be deployed when the vehicle arrives at the destination.  That way, individuals with mobility disabilities wouldnt need to worry about whether there is an access ramp where they are going.  In addition, since there have already been lawsuits against shared ride services not being Accessible to individuals with disabilities (and Tesla has said vehicle owners could still use an AV to operate a ride-share service) then there will need to be vehicles designed to accommodate those with wheelchairs, who CANNOT leave their wheelchair to enter and exit the vehicle.

  I would first like to say that I think the Inclusive design Challenge is a great step forward and definitely needed to ensure that the disabled will be able to utilize autonomous vehicles. With that said I was a little disappointed to see that most of the awards went to universities. While they do have knowledge and good research practices, I feel that more awards should have gone to teams that have more real world practical experience. Some simple examples are as follows:
  1. Is there anybody on the chosen teams that has had to go and rescue a stranded physically disabled person in the snow at 1 am when their equipment failed?
  2. Is there anyone who has installed and modified vehicle for the disabled that is aware of the complexities that are involved.
 3. Has anyone had to investigate the charred remains of a disabled consumer that died while their vehicle burned?
 4. Has anyone had hands on interaction with training disabled users on the proper usage of adaptive equipment in vehicles and understands the challenges?

  My point here is Universities have a place in innovation but need to rely on the many individuals who have spent decades learning and understanding the real world environment of physically disabled individuals and their interaction with automobiles. The adaptive vehicle world has gone through serious evolutions over time and usually results in a period of unsafe conditions and products that are rushed to market. With the introduction of autonomous vehicles the challenges are even greater and the risks higher. Input from the real world and experienced individuals is paramount or the past will repeat itself.",,,,,,,

This is a strong step forward as a nation in creating an inclusive mobility ecosystem.  In building the repository of resources I would suggest engaging the following entities as leaders currently funding research in this space:  AARP, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the American Center for Mobility, and the US DOT UTC Program/Council of University Transportation Centers.   

In the Hub, I would suggest including literature for engineers, faculty, and graduate students to reference and educational materials in understanding disabilities and a repository of associations and non-profits that provide supportive resources or education on respective disabilities.  

For example, blindness and visual impairment is a very complex disability. Providing vetted reference materials for those researching, designing, and programming the vehicles of the future is critical.  It is essential that these professionals have a strong understanding of how these vehicles and technology need to be designed to support individuals who are blind.  In addition, organizations such as the American Foundation for the Blind, Blinded Veterans Association, and the National Federation of the Blind should be listed for researchers and engineers to connect with for any variety of reasons.  

The Hub should be a bridge that connects the repository of expertise in the supply and demand for our nation’s accessible future.

It will also be critical that US DOT engage the National Council on Independent Living, National Center for Mobility Management, National Aging and Disability Transportation Resource Center, and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging in designing and promoting the Inclusive Design Reference Hub.  These organizations represent incredible programs and supportive services that are provided to tens of millions of Americans with disabilities and older adults.  Their insight and perspective are essential in the success and utilization of the Hub.

Feonix – Mobility Rising is on a mission to create mobility solutions for the health and well being of every person in every community.  We see the future of automated vehicles pivotal in enhancing the equality of our society’s transportation ecosystem.  Through funding provided by the Michigan Department of Transportation, we have created an in-person workshop curriculum and online educational training program on disability awareness specifically designed for transportation professionals.  We would be happy to share those materials as part of the Hub.",,,,,,,

Hello my name is Ross Temple and I’ve been in a wheelchair for 27yrs. Was a machinist in the military and served during the first gulf war. I’m very familiar with the different ranges of injuries that is related with spinal cord injuries. I’ve volunteered at the VA Hospital working with veterans of all ages and levels of injury. My Question to you is how accessible do you want your vehicles? Are they going to be completely autonomous or have it available for driving for the most extreme injuries? Obviously a van would be your best option. With collapsible back seatings to fit a wheelchair. For cars a A frame hydraulic seat and seat base with clam shell front and rear door opening with swivel seats would give paraplegics ability to get into any vehicle and stow their wheelchair without any assistance from others.
I personally have been thinking about designs since I first started out. I understand limitations for refits on many types of vehicles because I’ve been through the gambit of conversions. Many of which are not practical for all wheelchair parking spaces. The problem with innovation in this area has been the crash tasting requirements. Which can be redundant and unnecessary if what you replace the existing metals with are stronger ones which is necessary for lifts and added support. I tried getting Braun Mobility to help me with putting forth a prototype but they was unreceptive. But that has been my plight being in a wheelchair. Accessibility of machinist’s shops and equipment. No one is willing to refit for people in wheelchairs. My injuries also cause me to have sores which keeps me laid up for months at a time. Having the understanding to do something, but not being able is frustrating and depressive. 
Basically I’m asking to help. I understand the limitations people in wheelchairs have. I understand what is needed for the very wide rang of injuries. I have understanding of the different lifts and their limitations as well. I have been exposed to all the new and old techniques used in Accessibility. The wildest one was a friend of mine who had barely any use of his arms and drove by joystick. It’s amazing what the US can do when we put our minds to it.

Finding an accessible car is just about impossible these days. Vehicles in the past (1970s-1990s) it was possible to purchase a 2-door vehicle & be able to fold your wheelchair & place in the backseat. I hope the autonomous vehicle designers will look backward to when we could do that. Not every wheelchair user wants a van. Some features to consider would be the car doors opening; it should be wide enough to allow the folded chair to easily roll into the back seat. Maybe a ""lifting door"" like the Delorean. The car seat should extend closer to the door for easier transfer for a person who cannot stand. The height of the car seat should be approximately 21"" from the ground up. Having to lift body weight either up or down can be difficult.  Thank you for paying attention to these issues.  ",,,,,,,

Here are three areas where additional specificity and work would help enhance the goal of this document:

1) There is a marked lack of attention to the needs of people with dementia. People with dementia and their care partners regularly identify transportation as a major barrier in daily life. Some programs by the DOT and allied federal agencies, like Section 5310, support for the NADTC, and paratransit monitoring, do support these needs. However, specific attention to the need for door-to-door travel, inaccessible wayfinding and street patterns, and a lack of support for care partners would go a long way towards improving transportation for older adults with dementia. Attention to supporting and growing Section 5310 grants and volunteer driver programs - likely through the ACL - comes to mind here.

2) The point about curricula is excellent. I think more attention to community planning curricula, through the American Planning Association and the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning, would be highly beneficial as well.

3) More explicit attention is needed to the interplay between cycle and pedestrian routes. Many older adults and people with disabilities do not feel safe walking on paths shared by cyclists. There have been successful path designs in New York City and Oregon that could be expanded nationally.

I look forward to expanded versions of the strategic plan, and the new policies which it will support.

I am an Independent Living Specialist employed by and representing North Central independent Living Services, Inc .in Black Eagle, Montana. I wish to comment on the draft report regarding accessible transportationDOT- OST 2021 - 0004 - 0002. As a longtime transportation advocate on behalf of Montanans with disabilities, I am very happy to submit these comments on this draft strategic plan. First, I would like to say that Montana and other rural  areas need funding and appropriate infrastructure to implement accessible affordable transportation. The federal government and state governments who implement accessible transportation need to be aware of the frontier nature of many areas regarding transportation. Transportation infrastructure needs are changing  Rural areas need to implement transportation modernization ideas in accordance with state individual infrastructure needs. States need to implement coordination activities as outlined  in SAFETEALU. I know this is not current policy , but  many opportunities  offered  through  that law may  benefit  states and communities. 
On the accessible elements of transportation,states and local communities understand that assistive technology for mobility devices and wayfinding are expanding. Many DME products  and providers are  recommending newer devices and  products. DOT may need to update  the standards regarding mobility and wayfinding devices as common  devices. Effective communication devices for the  deaf and hard-of-hearing   riders and consumer are often hard to obtain 
 in many areas. Local transit agencies need to ensure that PASS training regarding  these accessibility  elements   is available  in all  areas. Transit agencies oftendrive or travel long distances in rural areas. In the next transportation reauthorization bill, policymakers need to expand public  and or private incentives in order to expand transit  services and accessibility options  in rural areas.NCILS believes  that  discussions  on service animals, particularly  psychological and comfort  animals  should  continue. ADA TRANSITION  PLANS  should  be the norm for communities. 

NCILS is excited  by the future of accessible transportation. Projects that will enhance  accessible flight options ,accessible rail systems as well as autonomous vehicles provide hope for a future as Transit users commuters and travelers. However, if inclusive designers and individuals with disabilities are not testing and utilizing accessible equipment in all aspects  of a vehicle design. Rural areas need  to have inclusive designers working on vehicles which may differ from vehicles in urban areas.For example,there need to be studies on accessible flight needs in smaller aircraft and rail stations.DOT need to focus upon  intrastate  and interstate  transportation options in over the road buses  as well.

Many of the above mentioned  concerns  and comments can be applied to  the built environment as well.PROWAG has been a great guideline, but DOT/ DOJ,states , and local communities need to strengthen pedestrian and transit connectivity. Incentives for development need to focus upon disability accessibility in sidewalks,pathways,  and trail ways.
NCILS  believes  that  this draft plan  is  a great   starting  point and that  conversations  will continue.  Thank you for  drafting  this  accessibility  plan .",,,,,,,

There are several areas that NYLPI contends that the Strategic Plan should expound upon in order to better achieve its stated goals. Specifically:

• Pertaining to Goal 1 which entails the removal of unnecessary barriers for people with disabilities seeking to ride in passenger and commercial motor vehicles, greater emphasis should be placed on ride-sharing companies such as Uber and Lyft to increase their fleet of accessible vehicles. Ride-sharing companies collect record profits, and yet are woefully coming up short in promoting social equity through the provision of accessible vehicles. 

•Pertaining to Goal 3 which seeks to enhance opportunities for people with disabilities to walk, roll, cycle, and use micromobility services and other innovative mobility technologies to the greatest extent possible
o e-bike and e-scooter companies must innovate accessible options and make available to people with disabilities. Citi Bike, the NYC e-bike company, does not currently provide an accessible option, nor do any emerging e-scooter companies servicing the City. In accordance with disability laws, these companies must provide accessible options; and
o the importance of accessible sidewalks and streets must be emphasized in the Strategic Plan. In accordance with the goal of providing for the “complete trip” of people with disabilities, sidewalks must be fully accessible. Full accessibility includes proper curb cuts and Accessible Pedestrians Signals. Moreover, with the rise of outdoor dining, clear protocols and enforcement guidelines must be promulgated to ensure that sidewalks are not obstructed by private businesses. Lastly, protocols and guidelines should be provided for clearing debris and snow from sidewalks, as impassable sidewalks violate disability laws.

• Pertaining to Goal 4 which seeks to support the nation’s public transit systems and mobility providers in enhancing accessibility for people with disabilities, the Strategic Plan needs to clarify that full accessibility of rail and bus stations entails more than working elevators. Accessibility features such as system-wide installation of detectable warning surfaces and high visibility edge markings are but one example of necessary features which ensure safe and accessible transit systems.

Moreover, while NYLPI acknowledges the goals of servicing rural residents, such a goal should not imply that urban transit systems do not also need similar focus. New York City mass transit, for example, is the driver of nearly 10% of the country’s GDP.* Pre-pandemic, “the New York City subway system served 5.6 million passengers on an average weekday, while City buses served 2.3 million passengers. To put these numbers in perspective, there were almost as many public transit riders in New York City on an average weekday in 2017 than in all of the other largest municipalities in the United States combined.”** In order to rebuild the country, with people with disabilities fully participating, urban transit systems will need the full support of the DOT. NYLPI asks that the final version of the Strategic Plan integrate increased emphasis on urban transit systems.

Please consider:

1. Creating an ADA oversight body that actually enforces the law, rather than relying on disabled people to file lawsuits to protect ourselves. 
Or...
2. Creating a State or Federal Civil Rights enforcement body that actually has the power to sanction/ fine people and agencies for not complying with federal discrimination laws. 
For example, here in San Francisco we have the Human Rights Commission (https://sf-hrc.org/).  They do great work, but they are essentially powerless since they have no enforcement power whatsoever to protect disabled, LGBTQ, homeless, etc.  Again, it leaves all the burden on us to file lawsuits and find lawyers. 

2.  Passing new legislation that strengthens ADA Title II and removes the vague language around denials of access (""administrative or financial burden"" is the current language used to deny us access to transportation, restaurants, stores, and even our own rental homes.  Also, in the case of homes, the financial burden is put entirely on tenants.)

3.  Committing to increasing budgets specifically for improving transportation access.  i.e. giving bus drivers extra pay and compensation for the extra time it takes to board disabled and seniors.  Currently, they are timed on fixed routes which means that they are literally punished for spending the extra few minutes to board me in my wheelchair.

4.  Create an ombudsman office to help protect the rights of disabled people:  Many disabled people suffer from mental challenges, PTSD, schizophrenia, and other psychological roadblocks, as well as severe physical ailments that make it impossible for us to speak for ourselves. Sometimes social workers intervene with this, but they seldom have our interests in heart and are not employed to defend disability rights the way an ombudsman office is.  New York State has a program like this (https://aging.ny.gov/long-term-care-ombudsman-program), but California and most all other states do not.

5.  Stop relying on so-called ""stakeholders"" and corrupt ""non-profits"" that do not represent our community well and are afraid to make bold claims for fear of losing their federal funding.  Instead, use science-based polls, field research, and interview those at the bottom who are individuals with lived experience. Gather data yourselves (DOT), conduct interviews, take videos, and compensate people financially for filling out surveys and forms.

6.  Make Paratransit and transportation Free for Disabled and seniors living in dire poverty (SSI welfare).  If you are Severely disabled, odds are you have to survive on SSI welfare (http://ca4ssi.org/) or SSDI.  SSI only pays ~$960 a month MAX in California.  Imagine how easy it is to buy food, pay rent, clothe yourself, buy toilet paper, etc. on a budget that tight. Most are homeless or living in hotels / SRO slums and cannot afford transportation.  (See and hear testimonials her: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIGz3VVb4Qs).

7.  Create a non-biased Grievance oversight procedure for ADA access issues with transportation, with the hearing judge that is not employed by or working at the office where the complaint is filed.  (I've documented the corruption in my local ADA hearings on Youtube here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUht77IC_NQ)  and here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05q3GPIBTlg).  Note, the Transit Agency will no longer let me record my own hearing and says they are private ADA hearings!)

8.  Support the Driver Unions And focus on positive reinforcement, training, and changing attitudes. Get away from the discipline model, which doesn't work and just increases antagonism and hatred for disabled people.

These are just a few ideas, but feel free to share your own! I would love to hear from you.  Maybe we could all draft a joint letter with these demands and others, that we could submit for public comment and hopefully work with the new administration to make meaningful changes for with us!

This is a step roll in the right direction, but of course there's more work to be done!

More public transit, and having every stop be accessible, is very important -- reliable buses, light rail, and trains that cover a city's area so we wheelchair users can get to school, work, groceries, friends and of course doctor appointments. Paratransit is universally terrible and actively dehumanizing - you have to allow a 3 hour window for pickup and then the way back and on the drive, they may go out of the way to drop off someone else. You can spend all day going to one doc appointment and if you're ill, elderly, or in pain that is absolutely brutal experience. Compare to a city with good bus coverage - maybe you spend an hour and half tops if you need to transfer between buses -  and it's night and day! Thanks. ",,,,,,,

We look forward to your vision, leadership, and support to ensure the United States leads the world with advanced mobility and safe and secure operations. The Department of Transportation has always led the United States forward with transformational solutions in mobility. Rail, aviation, automobiles, urban transport are just a few. We have not seen an initiative to impact the nation at scale since the 1956 Interstate Highways Act. It is time to stop looking at the past and start to build the future.

The United States Department of Transportation leadership is vital to ensure we stay competitive and protect our national sovereignty. Investment in a 21st-century Digital Edge Infrastructure is among the highest priorities for stimulating economic expansion, national security, job growth and will drive the largest infrastructure buildout in our nation's history. Digital Infrastructure (PINNs, 5G, 1Gb+ broadband for all); Transportation (mobility for all, autonomous systems, resilient cities); Energy (charging stations, grid-scale storage, SMR, Direct Air Carbon Capture) are just a few listed in the Biden team Infrastructure Plan. Time to Build the 21st-Century Digital Highways. 

The Autonomy Institute is a 501c3 consortium of over 100 industry, government, and academia organizations. Our core focus is accelerating the ""Path to Commerce"" for Intelligent and Autonomous Infrastructure and autonomous systems. The Autonomy Institute would like to share our support for the U.S. DOT - Automated Vehicles Comprehensive Plan, more specifically for the CARMA and VOICES platforms. We believe these two platforms can be foundational building blocks for a national program when combined with similar FAA, NASA, and DOE efforts. With proper leadership, we can unify our digital infrastructure as we did for rail, aviation, automotive, electric, and the Internet.

I was also presented the IEEE Barus Ethics Award for by the late Rep. Elijah Cummings. This award was for my efforts to expose the post 9/11 DoD/DHS/Coast Guard Deepwater program issues in 2006. That effort led to my being a lead witness at a congressional hearing, appearing on 60 Minutes, being the first person to use YouTube as a whistleblower, appearing in several books on ethics and in a documentary, movie called “War on Whistleblowers”. I am bringing this to your attention because I want you to know I know how to do my homework. This brings us to the issues at hand relating to the approaches autonomous vehicle makers are using to develop their systems.

It is a myth that public shadow and safety driving can create a legitimate autonomous vehicle. And the lives the process takes are necessary and for the greater good. It is impossible to drive the trillion miles or spend $300B to stumble and restumble on all the scenarios necessary to complete the effort. The process also harms people for no reason. The first safety issue is handover. The time to regain proper situational awareness and do the right thing, especially in time critical scenarios. cannot be provided. Another dangerous area is learning accident scenarios. AV makers will have to run thousands of accident scenarios thousands of times to accomplish this. That will cause thousands of injuries and deaths. The next issues the use of gaming-based simulation technology which has too many technical limitations to facilitate the creation of a legitimate real-world digital twin. The solution is to use DoD simulation technology and shift most of the autonomous system development and testing over to it.

REMNAV Inc. is a silicon valley based startup company developing teleoperation solutions. We are focused on accelerating the commercialization of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology and ameliorating driver shortages in the commercial trucking industry.  We applaud the vision the DOT has outlined in AV 4.0 comprehensive plan to catalyze the adoption of AV in the United States. However we feel that a critical piece is missing in AV4.0 vision - the role of and the need for a human-in-the-loop.   AV technology, in our opinion, can become viable only by starting out in a geo-fenced manner where it can operate reliably and human operators taking over for the “first '' or the “last” mile or during unforeseen circumstances in between as a backup. The only practical and economical way to do this is for a human driver to tele operate the vehicle remotely when it is not being driven autonomously.  We respectfully request that the DOT include the following enabling elements in the plan:
Guidance and, where needed, the regulatory framework to drive the availability of 5G and LEO based connectivity for moving vehicles everywhere, including locations where line-of-sight is not possible, such as tunnels, etc
The necessary regulatory framework for license approval for drivers, insurance and liability regulations for the new paradigm of remote driving
Also similar guidelines and regulatory frameworks to enable remote operation of farm husbandry machinery on public roads

The plan identifies 3 goals: (1) promoting collaboration and transparency, (2) modernizing the regulatory environment, and (3) preparing the transportation system, which includes foundational research and development supporting transportation safety, efficiency, and accessibility.  These goals are consistent with those of HFES whose focus is on systems that work safely and effectively for humans.  

 HFES has issued a set of specific recommendations on the development of safe autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles (appended below) that fall into 4 main areas:
(1)	Automated vehicles require careful testing before deployment on public roads.
(2)	Automated vehicles should support the needs of human drivers and other users.
(3)	Automated vehicles should be safe and understandable.
(4)	Automated vehicles should be accompanied by detailed training for drivers.

Keeping those 4 themes in mind, selected comments on the DOT Comprehensive Plan are included in the attached file.

The Fiber Optic Sensing Association (""FOSA"") appreciates the opportunity to submit comments to the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), on the document, Automated Vehicles Comprehensive Plan (Comprehensive Plan).
[Docket No. DOT-OST-2021-0005; FR Doc. 2021-01115 Filed 1-19-21].

Founded in 2017, the Fiber Optic Sensing Association (FOSA) is a non-profit organization to educate industry, government, and the public on the benefits of fiber optic sensing technologies that enhance public safety, promote the security of critical facilities and infrastructure and protect the environment. Our members include organizations that manufacture, install, test, evaluate, support, and use fiber optic sensing systems and equipment. 

FOSA commends the DOT for its forward-thinking identification of the necessary steps required for working towards the safe and full integration of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) into the surface transportation system.  Appropriately the Comprehensive Plan establishes Departmental goals related to ADS, identifies actions to meet those goals, and provides real-world examples of how these Departmental actions relate to emerging ADS applications. We welcome the opportunity to participate in and contribute to this conversation.

FOSA recommends the DOT establish and maintain metrics tracking the availability of ""fiber enabled"" interstate roadway. Future-proofing our nation's highways involves placing fiber optic cables along roads when the opportunity presents itself to do so economically.   This will significantly lower future infrastructure upgrade costs.  Among other benefits, it will support the build-out of 5G wireless networks due to the need for much higher antenna density and drive the installation of more additional broadband enabling fiber optic cables. FOSA further recommends that DOT track in a publicly available format the availability and location of ""fiber enabled"" interstate roadway.   Such a forward-looking approach is a natural extension of DOT's existing ""Dig Once"" initiatives.

RTC of Southern Nevada feedback includes requesting the following:
•	Clarification on how the vision, goals, objectives, and actions align with the Secretary of Transportation’s vision and priorities. Provide clarification if there are planned updates, changes, or revisions to the AVCP, and if so, address when further guidance will be issued.

•	Additional use cases to the appendix or resource documents. By highlighting only five general use cases, it leads to more questions about other possible use cases for ADS that USDOT activities address. The scope of the USDOT’s supporting actions can be perceived as too general and/or limited. For example, consider adding other higher speed transit use cases like the ADS and BRT pilot project in Connecticut. 

•	Additional insight related to the FTA and transit. Currently, there is minimal information for transit likely due to public transportation fleets being the last phase of adoption with the high passenger count and safety-related challenges, however, there will be an impact to transit that should be noted within the plan.

•	An increase to the priority level to modernize the rules for AVs. Currently, modernizing the rules is listed as priority #7 but in order to make progress with AV projects (i.e., must be 25 mph or below, must weigh under 3,500 lbs, mirrors, steering wheel, etc.) staff needs flexibility and support by increasing the priority level.

We welcome the opportunity to participate in and contribute to the AVCP as Southern Nevada is uniquely positioned to be the testing ground for many innovation and technology projects. ",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2021-0005-0016/attachment_1.pdf",

We all know that the only ones that would like to see this modified are the airline execs, who would love to go back to advertising cheap fares with somewhat hidden fees that have to be added in or the total cost sussed out by the consumer. Sure, it makes the fare ""look"" cheaper, but it's not actually cheaper and leads to the kind of games and trickery that we all currently despise with resort fees. Who wants to book a $49 room in Las Vegas and then notice that the total is $124 with all fees included? Nobody. Resort fees are a total nightmare for consumers (were they the purview of the DOT, I'd go into more detail) and anything but full fare advertising for airlines is (and was!) a total nightmare. If I recall correctly, the original non-enforcement of the rule prior to 2006 is what gave rise to the obscene ""fuel charges"" known as YQ. Those are still around but are much smaller and less pervasive than pre-2006.  Long story short: It would be perverse to roll back Full Fare Advertising for airfare. It is to the consumer's benefit to see one price from each carrier. This allows OTAs to clearly let consumers search and sort fares. The opposite is of no benefit to anyone except the large corporations. I urge you to continue to work on behalf of the consumer and leave Full Fare Advertising in force and enforced. Thank you.

Recommendation: In reference to any type of communication with Tribal Leaders it is important that the Tribal Transportation Program directors are contacted as well. I am a Tribal Transportation Planner and often what happens is a letter or email will be sent to the Tribal President/Chairperson with a request for information or a deadline requesting data. By the time the letter is reviewed and forwarded to the end user transportation program, the request or date has expired. 

I am requesting that the Tribal liaisons ensure that the Tribal Trans Program directors and Planners are notified the same time as the Tribal President/Chairperson. In support of EO 13175, this would garner better communication and response from the Tribes on important transportation issues that may affect Indian Country.

A good example is the Tribal Technical Assistance Program (TTAP); the TTAP affects all of Indian Country, yet there was a drastic change to the program without appropriate consultation and input from the Tribes.  Losing the TTAP for over 2 years has caused a gap in important training for Tribal Transportation Planners, heavy equipment operators and road maintenance programs.

Since the ELD mandate of 2017, we have had to increase our operating speed to the highest legal speed in each state we operate in.  Because the ELD does not allow for any criteria but speed, this has cost us over $10,000 in extra fuel costs.  It also reduces our mpg, which means we use more fuel, burning more greenhouse gasses.  It also takes a toll on stress for us, as when one pushes like have to do, one is running on more adrenalin.  Before the ELD, we averaged about 60 -65 mph and pace our day.  Because of the time pressures of the ELD, we must shut down by supper time in order to find a place to park.  With most of the other drivers doing the same, the parking spots become a commodity, which the truckstops are capitalizing on.  Most are charging $20 per night.  That's why you see more trucks parking on exit and entry ramps.  Promoted as a ""safety"" device, the ELD is a costly device both in environmental pollution from higher sustained speeds but from a health standpoint from higher stress on drivers trying to do their job with more time restraints.  These higher speeds are increasing reckless driving and less road courtesy, which contributes to less safe highways.  The solution to all this is one which may surprise you.  Pay.  Trucking has always cheated drivers on pay.  Expecting us to spend unpaid hours loading and unloading, up to 12 hours at a time, and then expecting so many miles per day after that.  Well, in order to keep food on the table and the rent paid, drivers will push the speed limits and the safe hourly limits.  Every other worker in transportation like warehouse workers, fuel attendents, truck wash workers and inspectors gets paid while we are not.  If the pay was  rectified, if all our work was paid for just like every single other American worker, why would we speed, or work overtime?  There would be no point. And with the increased speeds, the deteriorating roads are beating us and our equipment up, endangering our health and safety from illness or breaking down equipment. The ELD allows no flexibility for all the constant changes we encounter.  A prime example is storms.  With the new technology, we can anticipate bad weather, but the ELD does not allow us the freedom to work around it, as sometimes we need to run longer to get in front of a storm's path, or risk the dangers of running in blizzards or hurricanes.  For over 30 years we have exercised caution and common sense when encountering these challenges.  The ELDs put us at risk here too, because we run harder than we wish to  in order to beat the storms or stop early and then feel compelled to push extra hard to meet delivery deadlines, all because of what California calls ""wage theft"".. If you look at the statistics, the accident rates for big trucks has risen, all because of this inequitable pay system.  And the ELDs are Trojan Horses, allowing remote hacking of our brakes, steering and engines.  This is prohibited by the Constitution too, because our enemies are known hackers, like the Pipeline which was recently hacked by state operatives, and the ELD knowingly gives them access to hack us.  And the ELDs themselves also violate Section 18 of the U.S. Code which forbids unwarranted electronic tracking.  Section 18 specifically states that it is illegal to electronically surveille us without a warrant, from a qualified judge, requested by a law official and only under suspected illegal behavior like robbery, murder or drug running.  So, basically, the ELD is a solution that was looking for a problem and it found one.  Even tho the FMCSA hearings in 2016 proved everything I am writing, the Two Billion profit the ELD makers made from the mandate over rode those warnings.  That and the FMCSA relied on them as experts and like most gov committees, refused to do their research independently.  Recall the ELD, then insist the makers pay for its removal and set up a committee made up mostly of drivers. Ask them their opinions, from the real world, as to what would help them stay safe and make a decent living.  It will be worth your while and help the environment to boot.",,,,,,,

 August 2016 – OMNITRACS, THE MAJOR MANUFACTURER OF ELDS, ADMITTED THAT ELDS CAN BE HIJACKED!  when their Product Manager was asked by   http://www.fleetequipmentmag.com/hack-heavy-duty-truck/ if a truck could be hacked.  “Clearly that depends on what type of equipment is installed in the truck,”  Omnitracs Senior Director of Product Management, Jeff Champa, slyly replied, explaining that the issue is one of security and sub-system access. “The sub systems on a vehicle may take action based on inputs from another subsystem on the vehicle. For example, a collision avoidance system may have the need to engage the braking system. Once the braking system is designed to take electronic input from another subsystem on the vehicle that exposes an attack point. Now consider the complexities of a vehicle network and telematics devices that essentially connect the vehicle to the Internet and you start to see the potential safety and security threats to a vehicle.”
 www.researchgate.net/…/220615090_Computer_hacking_and_cyber…
A book, published in 1999, (that is nearly 20 years warning ) which warns that  Cyber terrorists operate with a political agenda which means that these types of attacks, using telematics, will be more specifically targeted and aimed at more critical systems.
 June 2011 – Omnitracs first proposes using internet vs a USB connection.
On FMCSA’s own website, an independent testing lab wrote that “ELDs are too expensive and too open to takeover via the two way signal they use to operate. The lab recommended the flash drive/ USB device and the DOT enforcement community concurred.  Omnitracs, who is not an independent lab, but sits on the FMCSA advisory committee rebutted: “Given availability of more secure transmission mechanisms such as transmitting electronic driving records via a central server we see no practical reasons why FMCSA should allow transmitting electronic driving records via wired USB connections.” And it came to pass the ELD maker won, even though all these independent researchers and government agencies rebutted the safety of telematics.
April 3, 2014 – https://www.roanoketrade.com/cyber-liability-risks-transpo…/ In a recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, “Transportation & Logistics 2030, Volume 4: Securing the Supply Chain,” Data via web-based applications, are vulnerable to hackers and CAN ALSO ATTRACT CARGO THIEVES.

​ Aug 11, 2015 – https://arstechnica.com/…/hack-of-telematics-device-lets-at…… It’s fast becoming apparent that the CAN bus network—used by cars and trucks for the last two decades—can become a real liability once it’s connected to the Internet.
August 2016 -/www.wired.com/2016/…/researchers-hack-big-rig-truck-hijack-accelerator-brakes. Remote telematics hacking studied at University of Michigan where the U of M researchers were keen to delve into the likelihood of carrying out the same type of hack,remotely via the telematics links
Dec 12, 2016 – NHTSA warns of this: www.encompassrisksolutions.com/…/nhtsa-updated-cyber-securi… Cyber-attacks pose significant risks for both employers and employees. For example, successful cyber-attacks can TAKE COMMAND OF VEHICLE CONTROLS.
www.fullyloaded.com.au/…/truck-hacking-experiment-proves-pa…researchers, 2013 study by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency found researchers could make vehicles “ suddenly accelerate, turn and kill the brakes”
And finally, the courts have ruled that selling something that will help our enemies hurt us is treason: The Supreme Court has said that “any person owing allegiance to an organized government, who makes a contract, by which, for the sake of gain, he contributes most substantially and knowingly to the vital necessities of a treasonable conspiracy against its existence, has committed treason to his government”.  Omnitracs and others have made over $2billion dollars from getting the ELD approved, and you now know what is the punishment for this.
How much more proof do you need?  The ELD is a dangerous device for American drivers, commuters and now for the safety and security of the whole country.  These risks are known and the solution is known.  It is up to us to act, BEFORE tragedy happens.  Are you up to it my friends? Repeal the ELD and remove every single one of them from our vehicles, at the manufacturers expense.  Do it now.

Dear Secretary Pete Buttigieg,
I am writing to you about Docket # DOT-OST-2021-0036 in regard to  Executive Order 13990.

As a long time advocate for the trucking industry, I feel that the solution to the issues for the increasing growth of greenhouse gases is to eliminate the regulations requiring truck drivers to follow Hours of Service rules under 49 CFR 395. The Hours of Service rules are impractical and require drivers to stop for rest periods when they are well rested and may cause longer idling periods while the commercial motor vehicles are not busy being productive. Also, this leads to the deterioration of safety, which defeats the purpose of the FMCSA.

There is no mandatory requirement to have an Hours of Service rule. As you can see the statutory law says that the Secretary of Transportation ""may prescribe""...

49 USC §31502. Requirements for qualifications, hours of service, safety, and equipment standards
(b) Motor Carrier and Private Motor Carrier Requirements.—The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe requirements for—
(1) qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees of, and safety of operation and equipment of, a motor carrier; and
(2) qualifications and maximum hours of service of employees of, and standards of equipment of, a motor private carrier, when needed to promote safety of operation.

Also, I am including links to the Motor Carrier Acts to substantiate my claim.
Motor Carrier Act of 1935
https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015023952602&view=1up&seq=24
(Page 20 Section 204)

Motor Carrier Act of 1980
https://uscode.house.gov/statutes/pl/96/296.pdf

Mr. Secretary, The American Trucking Associations and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters stated that we need to revisit the Hours of Service rules again, during the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation committee hearing ""Freight Mobility: Strengthening America’s Supply Chains and Competitiveness"" on May 11 of this year. The Hours of Service rules have been broken for well over a decade. How many times do we attempt to dissect a twenty-four-hour period before we realize that the standard doesn't work?

My solution is to offer a tier level program. A type of concept that rewards and encourages drivers that are willing to participate in such a program. It must require training, education, and advanced training and education to advance a driver on the tier level. My team has a great deal of detail to offer on this program and will be more than happy to deliver a presentation upon request. However, this program will work to allow drivers the opportunity to rest as their bodies require, free up parking capacity, create more professional and better trained truck drivers, allow a decrease in fuel consumption, improve the safety standards, and help to advance economic growth within our nation. This is the type of solution to help satisfy the President's demand to improve health, reduce greenhouse gases, and increase economic growth.
Thank you for the opportunity to make a comment.

Respectfully submitted,
John C. Grosvenor

As an OTR driver of over 30 years experience, I wanted to comment on the impact of fuel spills and garbage collection enforcement rules concerning truck stops which are, for the most part, on private property. There are other pollution concerns as well, such as oil in the parking lot. These contaminates can enter the watershed through rain runoff. The impact is greater in agricultural communities. There needs to be a national policy on responsibility. States differ from state to state, even then, enforcement is almost nonexistent. Largely due to the fact they are on private land. Yet the impact effects us all as a nation. Truck stops try to keep up as is economically feasible. But the patrons themselves who travel across state borders need to be held accountable for their actions regardless of whether or not they are on private property. Enforcement policy and procedures need to be in place. A national standard needs to be implemented.
As part of the science, we don't know what's cooking in our environment. Future pandemics are inevitable as a symptom of the cause of pollution.",,,,,,,

The measures of accessibility: minimum distance, travel cost, and gravity potential.  The distances applied were based on the transportation network from the centroid of block groups to the centroid of public parks.  

The results of the spatial autocorrelation values and the accessibility measures were then correlated to determine which block groups were ""underserved"" based on the selected demographic.

A similar approach could be taken for this pursuit of transportation equity.  

Attached is my thesis document.  Below is the information about the article that was published in The Journal of Park and Recreation Administration (2008).  

Assessing the Locational Equity of Community Parks through the Application of Geographic Information Systems.

As a person who commuted to work daily, relying on a walk for the first mile, and then bus to the metro to bus and walk to reach my employment, the journey was enjoyable.  A young person does not mind the first-mile walk.  As a person who did not drive, having a Master's Degree was not enabling me to find employment outside public transport service area.  Housing in Urban areas is scarce.  The cost of housing is high.  People that live in urban areas either have no problem with transportation management or live in apartment congested areas.  In my case, the apartment area was within a mile of the metro area.  Had that not been the case, l would have appreciated options where reliable publicly funded transportation to the metro as first and last mile would have been available.  There is a technology that can make any shuttle act as an on-demand service.  Enabling local taxi providers to manage the First-Last mile for the transits would reduce risk while giving riders fluid intermodal travel.   Fare payment integration, and a reservation platform that includes a call center with audit features from ITCurves, have solved this problem for the rider.  
Subscription cards that will allow each transit to get billed for service provided include face recognition software within the vehicle to assure of the service provided, signature and fare card matching all are available.  A budget for this cost can optimize the number of cars needed to provide transportation to each local area.   Another option is to budget for giving a free fare, where a young person living close to the metro could inequitably benefit from not paying for transportation (superb), but the person who lives further or physically challenged cannot be advantaged.  People that have the option of paying more to receive a currently available door to door service with apps are enjoying a level of privately service transportation that could become readily available to people that are not app savvy, or have smartphones, and cannot afford to pay the TNC fares, even though the rates are comparable to public transport fares. Networking and incorporating private on-demand transportation providers will help transits with easy transitioning to electric vehicle fleet and later automated vehicle fleet, at no upfront costs to transits. Sustainable, environmentally friendly solutions support the local transportation providing businesses that have always been there for stranded riders.

Yet every year more money is spent on making truckers lives miserable. Ostensibly, the reason being safety related. Inspecting trucks for defective, faulty equipment. Talk about being safe, that's the worst place to be: side of the highway, just waiting for someone to run into you or the cruiser. Yet this is a common practice. What if instead we placed an emphasis on cars sharing the road with big trucks? I've seen very little of this. A billboard here or there, warning ""leave room when changing lanes, don't cut trucks off when exiting."" This is a great message but I have seen very little enforcement of cars cutting trucks off, as I witness it everyday. Maybe DOT/FMCSA should ride with truckers to see what we put up on a constant, daily basis. In closing there is no equity within DOT. If it were, the money being spent would certainly be distributed in a different proportion than what I see year after year.",,,,,,,

Transportation can't become part of their plan until they exit school services.  Many typical kids are driving themselves to work at age 16.  So those services need to be made available earlier like their peers. School should not have anything to do about if they need transportation or not outside of school.

Transportation needs made available for seniors and disabled of all ages to get not just to doctor appointments, but fun things too.  Community events and family events are important for mental well being and staying active and therefore being healthy, but there are often limits to those types of uses. 

Sometimes paid help have high numbers of people they are serving who might be difficult to handle in public. Therefore these individuals get less access to being in the community due to needing to keep them safe.  There needs to be another look at the numbers individuals are serving at one time so those numbers are reasonable in keeping people safe in the community. These numbers are too high in the schools as well as at agencies. Perhaps if those numbers were changed more groups would be willing to take on those difficult individuals and therefore they would be included more. Some transportation agencies need 4 to fill a car to make a profit but some individuals don't do well with being in a full car with others. Who pays the difference so that business can afford to do the work and continue to transport. 

My brother is a truck driver and he often says he gets cut off by cars.  I have noticed people are driving like they just don't care.  In Ohio the police are not pulling over people like they use to and people have the thought that they will not be pulled over and they are right. The likely hood of getting pulled over when you are driving unsafe is less likely now days.

More and more people with disabilities are driving.  When they do get pulled over they sometimes have a hard time communicating with police like same age typical peers. I'm sure it is difficult for police officers to know who is drunk and who don't have abilities in the first place to answer questions and communicate effectively.  There needs to be a way for people with disabilities to heard when asking for a support person to be there in the case of a traffic violation and that that request is honored. We can teach people to advocate but that only works when a person is heard. 

Roads need to be built in the US so people can use alternative transportation like walking and biking.  So many areas are not friendly to other forms of transportation.  Developments are often given rules about needed sidewalks and handicap accessible but sometimes lead to nowhere. There are curb cuts that only lead to a road with heavy traffic. Our roadways in the US need to help all, have access to traveling to more than a block from your house. Every road should have a walk or bike lane to give better access to all even those who chose to live outside the city or bus routes which are lacking in most places. This could be part of the roads and bridges upgrades to get people back to work and increase accessible access. ",,,,,,,

Below I provide a couple of papers that highlight work that we have done in this realm.  In short, we are able to use a variety of open source data (ACS, GTFS primarily) to develop an index of access to critical needs.  We also partnered with a local nonprofit to link this index to affordable housing units in our metropolitan area.  We believe that this can play a twofold role - identifying affordable housing units that need better transit access (so they might own fewer vehicles) and also identify regions with very good access that are ripe for affordable housing investment.

We have also done a great deal of work with our state DOT evaluating equity as it relates to Title VI requirements.  I am happy to have further conversations if any of this is of interest to you.

They agencies don’t out right say it, but results speak for themselves. There is a great opportunity to mentor DBE that have been in business for 10 years or greater.

The problem is the DOT is mandating test that are unconstitutional, violates everyone’s privacy and these random test DO NOT measure if someone is UNDER the influence. The DOT requires Urine sample to be collected for the 5 panel drug test but then a breathalyzer for alcohol.

Protecting your job is taught to be the most important thing out there, so when it came time for my witness to speak up, he suddenly had amnesia.

If the FRA is using surveys from Dunn & Bradstreet to determine  minority participation for Jobs ACt ( and other programs)  then this will be a server case of under representation.

Faucett & Associates should expand its survey source to include, for example B2GNow.  An organization that manages  minority firm data for the purpose of contract and bidding analysis.  B2GNow has over 300 clients representing  cities, states, counties, and agencies.

With mobile applications being widely used and the need for computers to reach resources, DOT must work to establish a digital literacy index for each funding area.  For communities with higher digital literacy indexes/scores funding for outreach communication  may be less compared to a city with a lower DLI.  
DLI factors can vary.  Factors like % of college level citizens, smart phone usage penetration, age, per capital access to computers, High school drop out rates, % of people using public assistance, Number of phone applications used per person on average, ect  all play apart in communities or people's ability to have access to information or opportunities.   Cities like Seattle would have a higher score vs a city like Macon Ga.  Establishing information sharing opportunities in these two cities should look different.  One city could be completely digital while the other may require more outreach.  Digital cities are more effective at spreading information and providing access.   Equity is no longer about just race, it is about access to the digital information.  Maybe more money could be spent by DOT to close the digital gap in communities, which would have a bigger impact on all funding in the long run.",,,,,,,

A hostile work environment leads to on the job anxiety, mental stress and friction between coworkers. If this worksite condition if left allowed to prevail, which many jobsites today can be categorized as hostile work environments, it will continue to lead to unsafe work practices that may and do cause high attrition rates, injuries and death, in addition to higher training costs from a high overturn, lower production and low quality products. With a campaign that supports leadership education focusing on the latter, chances are the U.S. President could influence leaders of agencies and owners of companies who would then be curious to implement a Work Safe culture, that would not tolerate hostility, be more production and have a higher quality product. The benefits would be more employee retention and a greater number of minorities/underprivileged in the workplace.

RE: ""...best practices that may be used to understand and to strengthen the pipeline for more minority, women, people of color, people with disabilities and other underserved populations to access opportunities, develop a robust network, and build a supportive environment that addresses their structural barriers to opportunities and wealth."" 
I began working in commercial construction in the 1980s as a truck driver and laborer and joined the UBC as a carpenter apprentice in 1999.  I am still a member of the carpenters’ union, and I am currently Placement Coordinator for the UBC National Job Corps Training Fund (UBC NJCTF), which contracts with the DOL to provide 73 carpentry pre-apprenticeship programs at Job Corps centers across the nation. Based on my experience as a female trades worker, instructor, and now coordinator tasked with placing graduates in sustaining-wage trades jobs, I have some observations I want to share about the need for diversity, inclusion, and most important - equity - in transportation, construction, and infrastructure careers and how the DOT can help achieve these. 
It is no secret that there is an impending shortage of workers to do these jobs. So, in addition to its being the right thing to do, it is the necessary thing to expand the talent pool to include those who have been overlooked and often overtly excluded, including BIPOC and women.
For people in underserved and underrepresented groups to have access to these jobs, they need to know about them, have access to the training for them, and in most cases, have a way to stay afloat financially while they are learning the necessary skills.
Funding must include advertising and outreach to potential jobseekers wherever they are. I remember seeing a TV ad (probably in the late 1990s) from the Maine DOT that showed women doing heavy highway construction jobs. It said something like, “If this looks like something you could see yourself doing, call…” and an 800 number flashed across the screen. I was thrilled, but also angry that there had been nothing of the kind when I was looking all throughout my twenties. I had no idea about where to go, what to look for – none of it. But I sure recognized it when I saw it.
Funding must be provided to ensure there are enough high-quality pre-apprenticeship programs to serve all interested, eligible applicants.
And funding must be allocated to provide stipends for those attending pre-apprenticeship training. Otherwise, so many people who lack the resources to support themselves and pay for transportation, childcare, etc. while getting the training they need simply will not be able to access these living-wage transportation and infrastructure jobs.
Regarding jobsites themselves – public transportation projects need to have robust hiring goals with enforcement mechanisms, oversight, and transparency so that real progress can be made in terms of equitable hiring. 
Finally, to retain this workforce – and by “this” I mean not just traditionally marginalized groups, but Millennials and Gen Z folks in general – there must be an industry-wide reckoning about construction jobsite culture. The DOT has an opportunity to make an immense impact in this area by mandating respectful workplace training and similar initiatives on public projects. Until this is addressed in a meaningful way, we will never be able to retain enough people to staff all the projects that are on the horizon. I’ll share the words of a twenty-something (white) young man I recently spoke with that sum up the experiences of too many: when I asked him why he was leaving a good job as a trade apprentice, he said, “I’m sick of working with a**h@!&s.”

I am a tradesperson who is fighting for more recognition of BIPOC and women in the construction and trades industries. There is a definitive lack of support entering this field from a government and public sector. The programs that do assist underserved persons entering the trades are often non-profit organizations with limited resources. They work hard to serve the community, but they could really use the help of larger entities. In turn this could really help save America's shortage of skilled tradespersons, particularly in the treats to come as baby boomers are retiring. I suggest the following: 

Encourage more collaboration between state Departments of Transportation, Registered Apprenticeship, Community College and Workforce Development systems to increase career pathway opportunities for women and people of color

Include robust workforce hiring goals on public transportation projects for women and people of color and have transparent, public reporting

Require jobsites to implement respectful workplace training and programs such as RISE Up to decrease harassment and increase retention

Provide funding to implement a statewide Ombuds office to monitor jobsite conditions and provide support to correct them

Include funding to increase support to low-income communities and Tribal Employment Rights Offices and
Provide funding for jobsites to have a workforce equity liaison and support community engagement and oversight

Oregon Tradeswomen is a nonprofit based in Portland, Oregon that has served women-identified jobseekers and tradeswomen for over thirty years through advocacy, pre-apprenticeship training, leadership development, and retention services.  Our mission is to ensure that women have access, opportunity and equity in high-skilled, high-wage careers in the skilled construction, manufacturing, energy and transportation sectors.  Through access to such careers, women, how are largely clustered in low-wage occupations, can move into careers that while considered ""non-traditional"" allow them to provide economic security and self-sufficiency for themselves and their families.  Through federal public policy that has an intentional equity lens, not only can women move from poverty to prosperity, but industry can benefit from a skilled, diverse workforce, and our communities can benefit from a return on investment in creating jobs that are high-road.  We ask that the U.S. Department of Transportation consider the following strategies for equity, which are also outlined in the National Taskforce for Tradeswomen Issues policy recommendations for equity in infrastructure.  They include:

No privacy, no dignity and not always safe. Now she is a teenager and changing her in the back of the van is hot, uncomfortable and not safe for her or I. She deserves privacy, safety and respect just like everyone else. Adult changing areas in all rest stops would be amazing and should be the norm. We would travel so much more knowing this was an available option along our journey. Everyone could use an adult changing area. Ask any parent, using the baby tables are not ideal. They are not comfortable for the child or convenient for the parent. There is no room to place diapers or wet wipes or set anything you may be carrying with you. Please imagine life through my daughters' eyes. Imagine everywhere you go, there are no doors on any bathroom stalls and there is no toilet paper. Frustrating, right? Embarrassing, right?

In the name of Economic Justice, there are also many low income areas negatively impacted by this project without any benefit or potential for economic development.  I might also point out that this project has never been able to prove its economics will be successful. The Ridership figures alone were Not supported by TXDOT nor by the Reason Foundation, a third party. Finally, the 1/3 distance of Land that has been purchased is owned by the Bank of Japan, basically the Japanese Government.  This is an Uneconomic project founded on Unethical Behavior by its Developers and has Never been a US or Texas Project from Day One! ",,,,,,,

Unlike local mass transit that you can ride for affordable cost this project is anything than affordable by the people it will impact and they will still be restricted from using the HSR. Metro Houston only collects 10-20% of cost from the farebox. Houston Metro rail cost is $1.25. Even Tex Rail in the DFW area is $2.50 or $5.00 for all day pass. Houston Metro for students, Seniors and disabled  are about 50% off the full price above. 

This project per FEIS fares are estimated from $130-180 this is not affordable for vast majority of the people that make the trip in cars. 
If we the taxpayers fund any part of this project or any project , even if its loans , it should only be used for projects that actually offer an affordable transportation for the taxpayers. Not a project that benefits only a few and for the Common person looking for work in the $30-50K salary range is unattainable with those fares. Even using conservative figures of $100.00 day pass 4 days a week to commute to your job. The cost of the HSR ( without last mile or fist mile cost ) is $20,000.00 a year! 

Again not a single dime of taxpayer money should be spent on any project anywhere that the common taxpayer cannot afford to use.

Thanks for your time

We need to ensure that any project that is federally funded in any way such as with grants/loans/stimulus is able to be reasonably used by everyone. The Texas Central HSR project should not receive any such funds as they stated they are a private project with ticket prices similar to an airline ticket. Most individuals cannot afford such a ticket to save approximately 1 hour. This particular project with a cost of 30 billion + is meant for the business class and elite and the people that lose their land and homes cannot even afford a ticket to ride the train. This is not equitable in any way. Multiple low income and minority individuals in Le May and Le Forge will lose their homes and they see absolutely no such benefit from this particular HSR project. Unfortunately the ones that benefit are a set of developers and foreign countries such as Japan, Spain, and Italy at the cost of disadvantaged communities. 

On a further note, the electrical grid  in Texas is extremely unstable with blackouts which recently led to the death of a number of minority and low income people. Many of these individuals cannot afford a generator and reasonably expect the government to ensure stabile electricity during hot and cold periods. It is an expectation of the people that the federal government before signing off on a project that impacts so many people to do their due diligence instead of putting people’s lives at risk. The federal railroad administration signed off on the Texas Central HSR project that there was enough electricity in Texas despite the numerous comments and evidence showing otherwise. Taxing our already overburdened grid can cause collapse and further injury to the most disadvantaged. The federal government needs to protect the public instead of serving the interests of corporations such as Texas Central along with foreign interests. This is not equitable.

Please ensure no federal funding is provided to Texas Central Railway as their project hurts the low income, minority and rural communities while offering no benefit at all to these individuals.

Thank you,

Something as easy as the zoo, for everyone else, is not easy for us in more ways than just getting my disabled son there and around.

He’s in diapers at 5, and will more than likely be in diapers for the rest of his life. He needs to be changed, as does anyone who cannot go to the bathroom on their own. At 5, he no longer fits on a baby changing table, if that’s even available. I REFUSE to change him on a dirty public bathroom floor. BUT, we are running out of options, especially when we travel. Currently, I change him in my car, which in itself is demeaning and uncomfortable. If we have the trunk packed to the brim, as we usually do, we have to change him on my very small car seat. Recently, there was no room and we literally changed him on a towel in a field on the side of the road. 

Did you know most hospitals don’t even have adult changing tables as options? Or that I’ve never known a men’s room to have any options at all? I recently had to contact our zoo as they revamp to see if they were including adult changing tables. Honestly, I shouldn’t have to do that, contact every public place we visit to make sure they have a place for my son to go to the bathroom with dignity.

Accessible bathrooms should be required in every public building. Period. It is insane to me that we even have to fight for this. ",,,,,,,

Thus needs to stop as it is damaging to us.

Dear Judge Duhon,


I am a retired 70 yo who lives in White Oak Falls, Harris County, Houston, Texas. I live in White Oak Falls, the only subdivision the High Speed Rail will go through.  


The motion for rehearing to the Texas Supreme Court will be denied again and this time it won't take as long. I knew this would happen and so did the other residents of this subdivision. 


Texas Central is no longer damaging the 249 homes/homeowners that would be taken under Eminent Domaine in our subdivision. It's the Texan's Against the High Speed Rail that is damaging us. Texans Against the High Speed Rail is destroying our chances of getting a fair price for all the damages caused to us.


When this first started the home I bought to retire in 2006 was comparable to the 300,000 homes on the market in 2016. My taxes are frozen at the 2009 rate of 1.9  but decreased a small amount due to the pandemic to 1.3 last year. I am retired, live on SS benefits and a small pension. My income will not allow me to get another Mortgage. Even if I was able to move, my Taxes would increase significantly, further damaging me. My finances do not allow me to have a mortgage payment for a house comparable to mine of the taxes and insurance.


Are you going to start contacting the homeowners in White Oak Falls who you are damaging by keeping these lawsuits going. In some cases you have cut people who came to you for help and then never spoke to them again. Disabled and retired people need you to negotiate a decent price to cover damages because they won't be able to get another mortgage. 


There are homeowners wanting to  contact Texas Central to discuss reaching a deal under the table. Landowners are not losing their homes, they are losing a small piece of property. People like myself are losing everything.


Continuing to fight this at this point is keeping this hanging over everyone's head. At some point you have to cut your losses because you're doing more damage than good. Investors are buying up Homes in White Oak Falls for rock bottom prices so they can claim loss of use and loss of rents and turning the subdivision into a ghetto which is dropping our home prices even more. What are you planning on doing about that? 


Homeowners are even discussing a lawsuit against the Texans Against the High Speed Rail  for the additional damages it's costing them/us. 


This is not about home and property owners any more. It's about your egos and your pocketbooks and the longer you keep this going the more money you are bringing in for yourselves and your firm. The rest of us are suffering because of the damages it's costing us.


As for me, in order for me to get another home I have to have my current mortgage paid off and $500,000 to be able to buy a house comparable to mine to cover future taxes at a 2.9+/- rate to pay homeowners fees. I have to pay cash because I can't get a mortgage. Are you or the Texans Against the High Speed Rail going to cover it. I'm not the only person here that you are damaging.


I look forward to hearing from you about your plan.",,,,,,,

DOT–OST–2021–0056-0001. My name is Nancy Baker Curtis. I am a board member for The Arc of Iowa and a coordinator for Changing Spaces Iowa. Additionally, I am a member of the sandwich generation. My almost 6 year old son is intellectually and physically disabled as the result of a genetic abnormality called a variant of uncertain significance. Charlie uses either a gait trainer or a wheelchair to access the community. Also, my mom Vicki is a four time stroke survivor. She is unable to stand unassisted requiring multiple caregivers or a lift to transfer from her wheelchair to any other position. My 74 year old father, John is her primary caregiver. 

In 2017 I learned first hand the challenges to locate truly accessible restrooms when I began traveling with my son to offer respite for my dad as my mom was recovering from her series of strokes. At the time Charlie was two. We traveled along Interstate 80 from Illinois to Iowa. While we traveled we struggled to locate private, safe, dignified changing spaces. 

What we encountered was inadequate equipment that posed an increase risk of injury to Charlie and myself. While Charlie was still within the weight range for the wall mounted changer in the public restroom, he was much too long. But we used it until he became aware of how high he was perched above the ground. So we fled outside the rest area to the back of our car or a shady spot on the ground off in a semi-secluded spot. 

Unfortunately, the weather changed making the back of the car in the public parking lot no longer a viable option. The winter weather, freezing rain and subarctic temperatures forced us back inside the rest area to face our last option, the bathroom floor. Charlie, like many developmentally delayed individuals is orally seeking. He would attempt to put the debris tracked in from outside into his mouth. The floor was littered with toilet paper, salt and chemical de-icer and fecal spray from the toilets. Toilets in public restrooms don't have lids to contain the spray.  What Charlie needs is a height adjustable adult size changing table in an assisted/ family restroom. 

While my mother does not need a height adjustable adult size changing table, she does need a larger, more spacious multi-gender restroom which allows for multiple caregivers to assist with transitions and transfers. My mother and Charlie deserve privacy. Traditional ADA restrooms don't have doors that allow for candid, private conversations to take place between a caregiver and dependent. As a consequence many individuals avoid patronizing locations because they are tethered to their homes and a safe, private, dignified toileting space. 

I respectfully request that the USDOT examine the accessibility models being implemented by the Florida DOT and the Iowa DOT to expand beyond what the ADA requires to include safe, private, dignified changing spaces with height adjustable adult size changing tables. No person, child or adult, should be forced to be changed on the floor. Individuals come in all shapes, ages and size as do their caregivers. Having a height adjustable adult size changing table that can fold flat against the wall improves access for all. 

Disabilities travel with the individuals that have them. They are not left at doorsteps or invisible state lines. Individuals with disabilities should be able to travel throughout the United States and be able to locate accessible ADA restrooms that meet their toileting needs. Unfortunately many states, counties and municipalities function off outdated code that limits the access of those that reside in that region. The addition of expanded ADA accessible restrooms along interstate highways would establish a precedent in every state.

DOT-OST-2021-0056 

High Speed Rail  (TSR) in Texas

There are numerous reasons which this proposal should NOT proceed:

Loss of property to land owners.

Environmental damage; we are in a fly-way for birds that migrate.

Damage or complete loss to existing roads, leading to diversions of school buses, EMS, LEO, regular travelers

Uncertain pricing of tickets (one can already fly for a very reasonable price)

Burden on already troubled electric power system.  

Electric power is NOT green unless it comes from water/dams.  Even the wind power, although that portion seems to be 'green', in reality operating them is not totally green.  Natural gas is somewhat 'green', compared to oil or coal.

Proposed system (equipment) does not merge well with any other existing or proposed systems

Equipment is NOT the 'latest and greatest' available, in fact is almost 'antiquated'

Sincerely doubt there will EVER in the next 25 years be enough riders to break even, much less turn a profit

Company has stated they will have enough funds to complete and operate system; then later has commented otherwise (will need federal funds)

Already some 'purchased' land has now been deeded to the Japanese backers; thus eventually the land will be owned by them for  whatever use they can contrive once the company 'fails' to perform a profit.

Texas has made it abundantly clear with legislation that they will not put any state tax dollars for this doomed project that the majority of Texans cannot afford to ride.  No federal funding should be moved into this project since it hurts low income and disadvantaged communities.
 
The Dallas to Houston HSR project harms the general public with the minority, rural, and low income individuals being especially negatively impacted.  This project with its large berms for half of its route increases overall times for emergency response for both medical and safety crews.  These berms will also increase flooding to these communities. The Atmos compression station in Waller county has routine emission releases of flammable gases that could be ignited by sparks from the electric catenary above the HSR. The public made numerous comments about this hazard and movement of this train away from the Atmos compression station in order to prevent possible catastrophic loss of life to the nearby public but no actions were taken by the FRA or Texas Central Rail.  We owe it to citizens to provide better, safer transportation projects than the Texas High Speed Rail project which harms many more of the public than in helps.
 
Please do not provide any loans, grants, tax incentives or waivers of risk premiums for any project such as the Dallas to Houston HSR that hurts disadvantaged communities and are unaffordable to the public.

Every project requesting federal funding whether in grants or loans should meet the bar of being affordable to an individual making under 30K a year.  If not use the funding to assist other projects that are more equitable in nature. Brighline has affordable tickets for the public. Amtrak also has affordable tickets. The Dallas to Houston HSR is not affordable and tickets are estimated to be par to an airline ticket. A project such as this would not be able to be used by low income individuals and truly is set up for the elite and business class only as even middle income families would be unlikely to afford a ticket.

For example the Dallas to Houston high speed rail project appears to be the costliest in the world at 125 million per mile to construct with the lowest ridership so the federal government really has no business using our federal tax dollars to prop up such a project meant for the elite.  What is the cost per ticket is an easy litmus test to foresee how equitable the project is and if federal funding should be used.  Other simple questions that should be asked before disbursing federal funds would be who is benefiting? United States or foreign countries? For example, the Dallas to Houston HSR project is set up to benefit Japan who is selling us the taxpayers the technology, Spain who will be operating the train, and Italy who is designing and constructing the project. Where is the equity for low income or even Americans in general for a project such as this?  We have to ensure that Americans will be benefiting the most if not entirely from upcoming infrastructure projects.  Any project should be interoperable to receive funding as well
 
Thank you for your time and assistance.

My name is Sarah Knowles, and I am the coordinator of Changing Spaces Wisconsin. I have a 21-year-old son, Matthew, with intellectual and physical disabilities due to cerebral palsy and a rare genetic abnormality. He is a full-time wheelchair user and depends on others for full assistance with activities of daily living.
Despite his disabilities, as a baby, and when under the weight limit for a baby changing station, we had no difficulties travelling and doing things others take for granted. However, it is many years since we have been able to leave the house on a road trip without stress and worry about what will happen when Matthew needs changing. Very few public restrooms along travel routes within the US have a private, safe, dignified place to change anyone larger than a baby.
When travelling we use the back of our van as a changing station, which is extremely difficult now Matthew is a full-grown man. Plus, we live in Wisconsin so half the year it is far too cold to even consider this. That leaves us with the restroom floor. This is something we avoid like the plague, as literally Matthew could catch something very nasty from a public restroom floor awash with urine, feces and who knows what. His sensory needs are orally motivated and everything he touches goes in his mouth, so this really is a last resort. 
Advocates in Florida and Iowa have worked with their DOT to include powered, height adjustable adult size changing tables in interstate rest areas. I believe if it can be done in these states there is no reason it cannot be done on a national level. If USDOT implemented a program to include these tables it would greatly change the lives of families struggling to find somewhere to change their loved ones in a safe manner when travelling. The importance of a height adjustable table is to enable safe transfers for a wheelchair user (low) and safe working height for caregivers (high) in one piece of equipment. In addition, a family or gender-neutral private room is needed for the many caregivers, like me who need to use bathrooms along with a member of the opposite gender.
Being disabled should not be a barrier to travel and accessible restrooms need to meet the needs of everyone. We have made decisions to stay home based on the lack of facilities and this is a very isolating feeling.

If equity is to benefit ""all"" then this particular high speed rail project fails at that goal.  This is a luxury train that only the elite located in 2 cities will benefit.
Where does the inequity come into play....the general public and low income cannot afford the ticket price, locations of the stations, harmful to rural inhabitants and properties, electricity concerns as witnessed in the last winter storm catastrophe, flooding potential along the entire route, and emergency response time during construction in impacted areas greatly increased.
Also and most importantly, areas of the proposed route would directly impact the low income and minority communities.  And with the current increase in housing prices this would place those most vulnerable in dire circumstances.
These concerns have been raised repeatedly over the last 8 years to Texas Central and has fallen on deaf ears.
If you truly care about the hard working, low income, minority communities then please listen to this plea......
High speed rail could be better served in more densely populated communities where trains could be a much needed additional mode of transportation without impacting those who have suffered enough.

My name is Christina Abernethy and I am a wife and mother of three. Our son, Ethan, has autism and other medical diagnoses that will impact him through his lifespan. One of the hardest struggles we face as a family is the lack of accessible restrooms with adult sized changing tables. Baby changing tables are for babies and small toddlers up to 35 pounds. Our son passed that weight limit years ago. He is already 105 pounds and will continue to grow into adulthood.

Universally designed changing tables are inclusive and accessible for all people. Not only for my son, but for hundreds of thousands of individuals across our country that have chronic medical conditions, disabilities, injuries and other health concerns.

I have been actively advocating for changes in the state of Pennsylvania for the past several years and also a proud member of the nationwide campaign called Changing Spaces. I am the coordinator for the Pennsylvania chapter. Our mission at Changing Spaces is to promote community inclusion, access and equality for individuals with disabilities who cannot safely utilize standard restrooms independently.

Without adult sized changing tables, we are left changing our son on public bathroom floors (as you can see picture I shared) or in the back of our car in public view or he is left soiled until we get home. We are extremely limited to where we can go in our community and the list continues to grow as he gets older. 

When take major highways, NO rest stops or restrooms have universally designed changing tables. They are all BABY changing tables. Our family, along with many others, want to travel, go to the beach, visit family in other states and so much more! Unfortunately we can’t do that. When we do travel, we are currently changing our loved ones on dirty germ infested restroom floors. It’s inhumane and degrading.

Our loved ones deserve a safe, private and dignified space to use the restroom. We are not asking for special treatment. Using the restroom is a basic human right and it’s being denied to individuals every single day. Fellow advocates have made progress in Iowa and Florida with regards to adult sized changing tables. If USDOT would implement these universally designed changing tables, it would change the lives for families across our entire country.

I ask that you please consider and act quickly to install powered height adjustable adult sized changing tables into future plans. If there are family restrooms that are large enough, it is possible to retrofit a universal table and make the restroom more inclusive and accessible for everyone. 

Thank you for your time and allowing this space for parents, caregivers and self advocates to share our stories and why this issue is so important.

This private company provided the FRA preferred routes and guidelines to choose from as part of their DEIS.  By allowing a private company to choose the guidelines and almost predetermine a route based on their requirements is oppressive in nature.
Common sense dictates that a private entity is going to choose a route that will have the smallest economic cost while still meeting their goals.  This will always put the path of infrastructure projects through lower income housing and through farm land where the people are ""dirt rich and money poor"".  
This project is a prime example of why we urgently need the boards assistance for transportation equity.  This project goes through two very historic neighborhoods outside of Dallas that are predominantly low income minority neighborhoods that stand to be wiped out if the Texas Central High Speed Rail goes through.  In the FEIS they just state they will relocate and try to keep families together.  The golden question is who governs what this private company will do after the land and houses are condemned.  Who will hold them accountable after the project is started.  
The vast majority of the land needed between Houston and Dallas is Farm and Ranch land and generational land and homes passed down through families. Again the vast majority of these property owners are indeed ""land rich and money poor"".  They do not have the deep wallets to pay lawyers to help protect them from projects like Texas Central High Speed Rail who uses the threat of condemnation as leverage in negotiations.  
I am one of the hundreds that have had to pool our resources to fight a private foreign funded company from taking what we have worked so hard for.  We have had zero help from the Surface Transportation Board, the FRA or USDOT and have left to defend ourselves.  
We need common sense protections on projects that are designed for the wealthy that will not benefit any of the people outside of the city limits of Dallas or Houston.  

One of your questions was How should the Department assess equity in Federal funding distributions?  
The number one questions should be is it affordable to the average income family.  The Texas Central Project is projected to cost $30 Billion according to the Chairman Drayton McClane.  At present there is a strong push for a $15 minimum wage requirement.  If we take that wage then it equates to approximately $31,200 per year.  The estimated one way ticket cost for this venture will be $100.  At present you can drive round trip for less than $50.  This is a project that is designed for the rich but the low income and ""dirt rich and money poor"" people will have to sacrifice, their land, homes and businesses for.  This project should be a milestone of why we need Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.

Only the wealthy may benefit from this project as it on connects Houston to Dallas and vice versa. Those families this project will disrupt are those that work hard on their land day to day trying to make a living in a rural environment.
These people have been treated unfairly, have been lied too, and coerced by a greedy company trying to make money for it's investors, not to the benefit of the thousands of people this project will hurt.

I represent 28,000+ citizens of Grimes County Texas. As their County Judge, myself and our entire Commissioners Court have stated again and again, ""We oppose this project"".

The very purpose of a rest area is to allow travelers to stop and use the restroom, yet so many individuals are unable to do this because there is no universal changing table available. Florida DOT and Iowa DOT have seen this need and have been adding universal changing tables in their rest area facilities, yet too much of the country has not realized the importance of this to someone with significant physical disabilities.

The goal was to identify areas of need for further investment. Our methodologies, outlined in the report, could be scaled to a federal level. Our unit of analysis was generally a Census block group, but if information was unavailable at that granularity, we used the Census tract. 

We developed a transportation equity index that considered access and system performance measures such as the number of transit stops in the census tract, distance over a half mile to high frequency transit routes, percent of workforce commuting by public transit, estimated average commute time, estimated difference in average commute comparing public transit versus car, percent of population commuting by transit with a commute greater than 45 minutes. As noted in the draft report, we estimated commute time because data was unavailable on self-reported commute times. It would be beneficial if the DOT could work with the American Community Survey run by the US Census to collect this data from residents so that true data can be used. 

Another issue with existing data arises when using  transit data provided by Maryland DOT. Even if a bus arrives seven minutes late, it is considered on-time. This is concerning as it ignores the fact that if riders have to take connecting buses, they may miss their next bus; yet all would be considered to be operating smoothly. Real-time publicly accessible data on ridership would be ideal.

Over the years, the world has become more accessible and she remains engaged in her community to the extent that she can.  However, the most basic, intimate need we all have is using a rest room.  Because she utilizes a wheel chair, does not bear weight, a typical handicap stall does not address or meet her personal needs.  She must have 100% assistance and those accomomdations are not available.  Today, we, like many families have to resort to changing in back of cars, alongside a road or on the floor of restroom (fearing that there is contaminated material that would impact her health and well being).  this dilemma is faced by thousands of people with a variety of health and disability challenges - like stroke, neuromucular disease, spinal cord injury, brain injury and more. With this opportunity to address equity and income deficits--- and health and phyical deficits - largely all underserved, we recommend that the Department devise a plan of action to design and build accessible bathrooms across America.

I would like to comment on the inequalities related to the Proposed High Speed Rail from Houston to Dallas.  This proposed rail would be built through rural, low income areas as a pass-through without access for the citizens living along its’ line. There would be negative environment impact and loss of property values for these communities. This rail would service urban areas while neglecting the citizens whose towns and communities it would travel through.  Some minority neighborhoods would even be displaces! Please reject this proposed line.

Jack Faucett is using Dunn and Bradstreet as a survey source INGORING .. the fact Dun n& Bradstreet does not identify minority firms and the survey results will be flawed and damage the future financial growth of minority firms by underreporting  minority firms that are qualified to bid on the Jobs Act funds. 

The Trump administration used similar tactics to undermine the need for DBE/WBE programs by narrowing their survey with white firms and white business groups.

WE HAVE TO CORRECT THIS WRONG BY MAKING SURE  MINORITY FIRMS ARE REPRESENTED WHEN THE  PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS ARE DETERMINED. 

There is concern the FRA's is not collecting enough/accurate data to reflect the number of women/minority owned firms that have the experience to successfully on funds associated with the Jobs Act.  Granted there is not a national list of certified companies, perhaps that will be collected in the near future... meanwhile one must use credible resources.  Using Dunn and Bradstreet is ...NOT A CREDIBLE RESOURCE.  Dunn & Bradstreet does not identity  minority firms.   

An alternative is to use B2Gnow which is company/software plan that DOES IDENITFY AND COLELCTDY  data from certified firms.  B2gNow has  thousands clients managing  Billions in contracts. This data base will be a strong cross section of the minority business community

Who knows what the final Jobs Act total will be however the fact is  1% of  1 Trillion is 10 Billion dollars.  So the concern is if an flawed survey results reduces the participation requirements by 1%... that means.. there will be 10 Billion less for  minority firms to create generational wealth from the Jobs Act funds.

The reconstruction program after WWII devastated many urban community by bulldozing homes and business for highways. If a flawed survey is the basis for participation requirements this time THE SURVEY WILL BE THE BULLDOZER

Please ensure that underserved communities which include rural communities do not have their rights abused and trampled on by the federal government or private companies that have been emboldened to do so by federal agencies. On a recent project the federal railroad administration worked on with Texas Central Railway, agents working under the guidance of the FRA trespassed on our rural property in order to obtain data and performed a 13 page illegal survey which I am including with this submission.  Every American citizen should be appalled with such an abuse of power by a federal agency. Please see the notification to the FRA and Kevin Wright of such trespass below.


Hi Kevin,

Since you are still the lead on the Houston to Dallas High Speed Rail project, I wanted to bring to your attention...for the second time...that an illegal survey was performed on the Calvin House property by agents Trina Meiser and Patti Hutchins recorded on 1/17/19 under the FRA’s guidance. A number of the photos would have been impossible to take on the public right of way, including one in which the small black driveway is in front of the cistern. The geometry and line of sight of buildings and other structures prove these photos were taken while standing on our property. There is no doubt individuals working behalf of the FRA and TCRR illegally entered onto our property to obtain information for the 13-page survey required for the Section 106 process, as our 1890's historical estate is located within the APE.
 
In numerous comments, you were notified of the historical nature of the property along with archaeological artifacts found in the proposed path of the train on our property. You were also notified that TCRR lost a summary judgment in Harris County concerning our property, in which they had asked the court for access to our property to perform surveys for the project. Despite these public comments (all of which I have recorded and can send to you), the FRA, TCRR and their agents chose to trespass on our property in complete defiance of the court judgment.

On November 7, 2019, you attended a Section 106 Consulting Parties meeting along with numerous other cooperating agencies. At that meeting, this issue of trespass on our property was raised, but then dismissed out of hand without any investigation by Tanya McDogall. Since our property rights were clearly violated and the court ruling ignored, a police report was filed for trespassing in Harris County, case number 1911-02362.
 
It is interesting that the following verbiage is found in the FRA's Draft Programmatic Agreement: ""WHEREAS, pursuant to 36 C.F.R. § 800.2(c)(4), FRA authorized TCRR to initiate consultation and prepare any necessary analyses, documentation, and recommendations on its behalf, but FRA remains legally responsible for all findings and determinations, including determinations of eligibility and effects of the Project.” I am sure a federal agency that remains legally responsible for all findings would not knowingly intend to advance a Section 106 NEPA process in which documented illegal data was used to complete the process. 

I look forward to discussing this property rights violation with you further and would like this comment to be placed in the public record.




Please see his response to this shocking violation:


Thanks for your email. I have confirmed receipt of a comment from you during the DEIS public comment period that no surveys are allowed on your property. I have discussed this further with our consultant and any photos taken while on your property will be removed from the Section 106 reports. 
 
Thanks,
 
Kevin



It is important to note that this illegal survey was used in the Section 106 process to collaborate with the Historical Commission to opt in/rule out our 1890’s building and surroundings.  The data acquired was illegal and a court order prevented both Texas Central and the FRA from obtaining such information. How are these actions on rural individuals equitable in any way? The federal government should never trample citizens basic property rights when procuring data to push through corporate and foreign agendas. This is simply wrong and should not be tolerated.
 
I am requesting that no federal funding be provided for any infrastructure project where disadvantaged individuals were oppressed and violated to obtain data. Otherwise, our taxes would be going towards projects that knowingly violated underserved individuals. 

Thank you in advance for looking into this and working on protections for disadvantaged communities.

Docket No. DOT-OST-2021-0056
Document Number: 2021-10436

I am writing as a directly impacted land/homeowner as a result of the proposed Houston to Dallas High-Speed Rail project.  I am also writing as a veteran of the U.S. Army.  
My family attended a town hall meeting conducted by Texas Central Railroad (TCR).  It was at this meeting that my family and I were made aware by representatives of that company that they intended to take my entire 50 acres of land for their project.  When I asked why, they responded ""it is because of the way your house sits that the route will run right through your living room"" and that it would split my land leaving the untouched area landlocked.  I also asked if they had the right of eminent domain.  They responded that ""yes they did"".  Please note that at that point and time, the routes had not been assessed, the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) had not even been started, and the question of eminent domain, to date, has yet to be legally settled.  However, this did not stop that company from attempting to use subterfuge in order to get my family to sign an option contract for our land nor did it keep them or their affiliates from trespassing in order to attempt to survey our land.  
The President's executive order 13985 addresses ""persons who live in rural areas"".  My family and I live in a rural part of our county.  This project, which has been rubber stamped by the Department of Transportation, will not only destroy what my family has built, it will also destroy the cultural fabric of our county.  We have been told by a representative of the Department of Transportation that unless a historic site was on the federal historic register, ""it didn't matter"".
If this project were to proceed, in my case, it would mean uprooting my family as well as our animals and equipment and trying to find a new place to live.  There is a phrase that people use that says ""some are land rich, but cash poor"".  I can tell you unequivocally that we are neither.  My family and I have scrounged for everything we have.  We have met our financial obligations on time, every time, even if we have had to make sacrifices.  If this project that I have described is allowed to proceed, it will rob my family of even being able to do that, even though we will still be financially responsible for making a land and house note on property that we will no longer own while attempting to start over.  
The people who will be asked to give up the most, the rural communities, will not see any benefit at all as the route bypasses them.  The jobs that are touted in the project will not be there once the construction is complete.  Additionally, those in the impacted communities will not be the ones chosen for those short term jobs.  
At this time, the company attempting this project has not produced their cost model for ticketing costs.  Since the projected costs have ballooned from 10 billion to upwards of 30 billion, one can infer that the tickets will be cost prohibitive for every day riders, especially those in the rural communities.  As such, I am asking that the Department of Transportation review the inequities associated with this project in particular and not award any federal funding to a private project that benefits foreign interests.

I would like to recognize Changing Tables and to show appreciation to the U.S. Department of Transportation for allowing public comments. I hope that we can use the models being put in place by Changing Spaces Florida, Universal Changing Places and the Iowa Department of Transportation to improve access for all individuals with disabilities. 

I can fondly remember going throughout life, traveled around the State of Iowa and our country but there were no accessible restrooms available for myself. Normally I was either with my mother or a female caregiver and had to choose to enter the woman's restroom quite often over the years. Now with the Iowa Department of Transportation, they are changing and improving upon height adjustable changing tables in rest areas across the state. I feel that this is one step forward in the right direction and for individuals with disabilities to have access to. It's critical and important for families, caregivers, and friends to be able to use when we're all traveling. For myself, it's a little bit more complex for myself being paralyzed. I have to rely upon others for total care. I would recommend that we take and consider to think about this a couple steps further and logistics. I'm approximately 140 lbs. and I would need either 2 people who could help transfer myself but I would suggest that each accessible restroom with Changing Spaces place a ceiling track system that could become installed each location to help individuals with mobility. It could reduce the bac breaking work of lifting yourself, your child, and reduce the stress of heavy lifting. It also would allow access for individuals who can live independently but need access to a ceiling lift. It could become a win win. We need to be inclusive and ensure that there is accessibility for all. The only next step in addition to implementing ceiling track systems, I would personally feel as though long term approach should be considered and to implement this info our National, State, City, campground/s, and park/s into this idea or suggestion onto Changing Spaces projects. I feel any parent, caregiver, friend, or individual who needs the help and services but the totality of access is important.

Thanks much,

Sincerely,

Garret Frey

Low Gross Revenue SBA Size Standards for Construction and Construction 

Related Services and DBE Personal Net Worth Caps Threaten M/WBE and DBE Growth by Providing an Artificial Data Metric That Prevents Participation and Parity in High-Cost Construction Regions

Submitted on behalf of the Board of the Women Builders Council
www.wbcnyc.org

The Executive Order “ Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government” signed by President Biden on January 20, 2021, directed federal agencies to assess whether and to what extent the agency policies and programs perpetuate systemic barriers to opportunities and benefits for people of color and other underserved groups, which includes women. The Department of Transportation is seeking comments regarding available or potential data and assessment tools that could assist in the ongoing and continuous evaluation of Federal policies and programs concerning equitable services and safety in the transportation sector.

Women Builders Council (WBC) is New York’s leading advocacy organization representing women and minorities in their effort to create a fair and equal playing field for contract opportunities at the local, state and Federal levels.  Founded in 2004, the organization is one of the strongest voices supporting the growth and development of small businesses in New York State and the region. For more information about WBC, visit:  www.wbcnyc.org 

THE CURRENT SITUATION
The current federal Small Business Administration (SBA) size standards both suppress the advancement of diversity and further exacerbate the capacity issue by prematurely graduating M/WBE and DBE firms out of the Federal programs as a result of inappropriate caps imposed for high-cost construction areas such as New York, Boston, San Francisco, among other urban centers, in which construction drives the economy as well as new job creation. 

For construction, receipts/revenue are a misleading indicator for size due to the material, supplies and labor costs in a particular area. Because the costs of labor and materials are much higher in some urban areas, the construction industry firm can easily exceed the gross revenue threshold. A similar issue is presented when determining DBE program participation based upon personal net worth (PNW). WBC submits suggests using a metric that would equalize costs across the various regions of the United States. 

The Solution We Propose.  By using an area multiplier that considers the higher operational costs in the various regions, the intent of the Federal programs, to level the playing field and eradicate the effects of past discrimination,  could be achieved for businesses owned and controlled by women and people of color in high-cost largely urban areas.

Small Business Size Standard Must Also Consider the Cost of Doing Business in a Specific Region. Currently, the Federal government uses the SBA size standards set forth in 13 CFR 121 to determine whether a business is small by reference to either gross revenues or number of employees. Many of the standards that qualify a construction firm as a general contractor or specialty subcontractor use the SBA gross revenue standard. The gross revenue caps do not consider the costs of doing business in a specific region. For construction, receipts/revenue are a misleading indicator for size due to the material, supplies and labor costs in a particular area.

The goal was to identify areas of need for further investment. Our methodologies, outlined in the report, could be scaled to a federal level. Our unit of analysis was generally a Census block group, but if information was unavailable at that granularity, we used the Census tract. 

We developed a transportation equity index that considered access and system performance measures such as the number of transit stops in the census tract, distance over a half mile to high frequency transit routes, percent of workforce commuting by public transit, estimated average commute time, estimated difference in average commute comparing public transit versus car, percent of population commuting by transit with a commute greater than 45 minutes. As noted in the draft report, we estimated commute time because data was unavailable on self-reported commute times. It would be beneficial if the DOT could work with the American Community Survey run by the US Census to collect this data from residents so that true data can be used. 

Another issue with existing data arises when using  transit data provided by Maryland DOT. Even if a bus arrives seven minutes late, it is considered on-time. This is concerning as it ignores the fact that if riders have to take connecting buses, they may miss their next bus; yet all would be considered to be operating smoothly. Real-time publicly accessible data on ridership would be ideal.

The more feasible, and probably less costly, location alternative which is available right now (rather than taking the beautiful land of private individuals for the current proposed route for this abomination), would be the current I-45 right of way from Houston to Dallas.   This use of this right of way makes more sense.  An elevated railway for this (I have to say it - “stupid idea”) may be built on the “existing” right of way which is already available.  

Additionally, has anyone even asked the public in the Houston and Dallas areas what their thoughts are on spending astronomical amounts of money on a high speed railway that will only benefit, in the majority, businessmen? A regular individual “will not”, I repeat, “will not” use this railway to live in Houston and work in Dallas because of the cost of the travel.  No one in their right mind will pay for the cost to travel daily between Houston and Dallas for work. It does not make economic sense. I haven’t heard any request for comments or approval for this project from the government.  The government is supposed to work for the people. Not be their parent and make decisions for them.

I had to cut past them here and the word count is already over the limit. Do you really want people to answer? 
We need to upgrade and maintain existing infrastructure before building more. If you are in a hole that is collapsing (our present infrastructure and funding) stop digging the hole first. We need to focus on areas that have a multiplier factor. Rebuild roads around schools for example helps roads, schools, safety, neighborhoods. Add ADA access to existing subways, railways, primary bus routes. 
The current system of required Transportation Planning Organizations across the country that serve as local authorities on where to spend infrastructure money needs to be staffed by experts and not politicians. Review boards and citizen boards need to have 50% professionals in the field- planners, engineers, educators, and people knowledgably. 30% general citizens. 20 % elected leaders. I see over and over the disconnect of elected officials and the public/ professionals. 
Housing affordability is only one index. Affordability and Equity needs to look at the community basic needs. What are wages, cost of food- food desserts, access to parks-open space, cost of utilities, cost of transit-transportation, cost of education- day care, cost of healthcare. Housing and Transportation are one element each. Overburden families should be measured on more than housing % income/ rent. 
The area of influence needs to be reduced to 1/4 mile. The area for daily basic needs and a 5 min walk. transit and other money is so scarce and we must force land-use planning to be hyper local. 
GIS is an amazing tool and can map incomes, rents, race, etc. the data is there and DOT needs to reverse red line. Find the areas deprived. 
Give more money directly to cities vs state pass through. The USDOT should take the lead on Interstate national railways-including land, rails, right of way the same as Interstate highways. The States need to take the lead for Federal Highways maintenance, airports, ports, regional commuter rail. Counties/Cities need to take the lead on transit and local roads, non commercial airports.

Please accept this comment on docket # DOT-OST-2021-0056-0001
My name is Lakisha Smith. I am a special needs mom and Disability Activist. My current efforts include co-heading the Georgia chapter of the Changing Spaces Campaign. Our mission is to To promote community inclusion, access and equality for individuals with disabilities nationwide who cannot safely utilize standard handicapped accessible restrooms.

Since 2016, the Changing Spaces Campaign has brought awareness and educated the public on issues concerning the disability community and public restroom accessibility. Many times our families are not able to travel, patronize businesses, or enjoy a fun day out because our loved ones are not able to perform a basic human need independently or with assistance. This need is using the restroom. There is a great need for an alternative to the toilet in public places. That need is powered height adjustable adult-sized changing tables. For example, my son is 18 years old and is considered “totally disabled.” He uses a wheelchair. He is completely dependent on others to perform all of the activities of daily living such as eating, bathing, toileting, dressing, ect. Consequently, many families like mine have been left with the option of changing our loved ones on public restroom floors, in the car, leaving them soiled while out, or ONLY taking them out for doctor’s appointments and hospitalizations. Hence, there’s very little leisure time.

Advocates in Florida and Ohio have worked successfully with their state DOT to include powered height adjustable adult-sized tables. We are asking that you consider this on a national level. This will significantly help to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities, the elderly, and chronic health conditions. Additionally, babies can also utilize these tables.. Powered height adjustable features would make it safer for those who can self-transfer to the table and for those who have caregivers to assist them. This will significantly reduce the risk of injury vs. having a fixed height table with no consideration for one’s height, weight, or size. These tables will allow our families to travel more while improving the public restroom experience. Everyone deserves a safe, accessible, accommodating, and dignified space to use the restroom in public. Please consider this need for the largest minority group in America, the Disability Community. Thank you kindly for your time and consideration! 

Note: attached is a photo of my son & I. I’m attempting to change him while sitting on a public restroom toilet. He dangling dangerously from my lap. This is the reality our families face day to day when out in public.",,,,,,,

I am apposed to the completion of this project on several levels.  1.  TCR route will disrupt Emergency Service routes to hundreds of citizens by crossing roads used to access these individuals and have not allowed for any plans or designated funds to alleviate this issue. This would leave the citizens of the counties impacted to foot the cost of this problem that they have caused. severely impacting the fiscal burden of counties residents unfairly. Transport of individuals in need of medical attention would likewise be negatively impacted. Loss of life would not be unlikely. 2  There is no way that the project can be completed with private funds, as promoted and promised.  Already TCR is seeking tax payer dollars. This project is doomed to financial failure just like the one in California based on actuarial realistic models. The taxpayers will end up toting the burden of this project for decades to come. 3. They are not a railroad company by any stretch of the imagination, no trains, no rails, no infrastructure, and yet have illegally claimed Eminent Domain and used it to trespass on private property unlawfully.  This is evidence that they are not honest in their endeavors and should be denied any support from any Government agency.  Please do not give any credence to these shysters.       ",,,,,,,

Please see comments below to questions presented.

(11) What assessment tools and practices are currently being used at any level of government that do not address equity or worsen disparities felt by underserved groups? What data are being used in a way that widens disparities in safety and access to transportation by traditionally underserved groups?

Federal agencies should perform their own independent studies on viability regarding ridership and costs to the public and/or state and federal government. One example of where the federal government completely failed the public is on the Dallas to Houston HSR project as they relied solely on Texas Central Railway’s ridership study while ignoring all other independent studies and did not perform one themselves. They pushed through a private for-profit project that underserved groups cannot even afford to ride and do not have access. They estimated ticket prices for a one-way ticket to be $199 in the DEIS. The FRA ignored safety risks provided in numerous comments. It should be mandatory that any major infrastructure project receive an unbiased and independent review and accurate cost to benefit analysis. The public deserves nothing less. 


(18) What are approaches that DOT can take to ensure that individuals from underserved populations are represented in our data collection efforts?

DOT should ensure that the underserved have access to meetings to voice their concerns and ensure their input is included in the project’s evaluation in a meaningful way. If the public and legislators are pleading to have in person public meetings vs telephonic meetings, then every effort should be made to hear the people and make sure they are represented. An example of where the federal government failed the underserved communities is on the Dallas to Houston HSR project in which the FRA denied the public its request for in person public meetings for the RPA and instead provided only telephonic meetings that lost connections during the meeting. They also changed the venue for a public meeting in Madison County (a rural community) and the new location was smaller and could not hold all the public, so they were turned away. People in Harris County were also not allowed entrance until other attendants left as capacity was not appropriately assessed. It should be an absolute requirement to provide public meetings that meet the needs of the community in which the infrastructure project will be constructed. Having to send people away because the venue is not large enough is unacceptable as the public is not able to have their voices heard. 


(23) What practices has the transportation industry taken to increase diversity and retain individuals from underserved populations within its workforce? How should the Department measure the overall impacts, especially the diversity impacts, on the workforce through Federal funding, policies, and programs?

First federal agencies should ascertain that the project creates more jobs than it displaces/loses. If more jobs are lost than created one should view this as a negative impact which hurts the community it should serve. For example, the Dallas to Houston HSR project only creates 1494 permanent jobs per the FEIS Section 3.14 – Socioeconomics and Community Facilities Table 3.14-20 while displacing/losing 1,598 jobs per the FEIS Primary Commercial Structure Displacements and Acquisitions Table 7-14. More permanent jobs will be lost than created as a result of this project with a net loss of 104 jobs. Most of the permanent jobs created consist of concession and rental car workers. This is not helping the community as most jobs are low-income jobs. Absolutely no funding should be disbursed for a project that benefits primarily private corporations and foreign countries at the expense of underserved communities.

Several commenters have already remarked on the necessity for adult sized powered changing tables in rest areas, so it should be clear that requiring them is the right thing to do. It is also the practical thing to do.

Consider the number of families dealing with complex needs who do not travel in the current environment. Would you go out if you weren't sure you'd be able to use a restroom? At all? Of course not. That was the default choice for my family of five, with one profoundly disabled child who needed to lay down for diapering. None of us went to the mall, to the movies, to the amusement park, to visit family further than a short drive away. 

How much money might we have spent if we could have taken family trips? At fast food or family restaurants? Day trips to tourist attractions? Even gas to get to relatives several counties or states away? But we did none of these things.

Individual businesses usually can't take on expense of adapting their restrooms for complete accommodation: they don't have the space or financial resources. If we were to take a road trip to Disneyland from the Bay Area, we might stop at a Wendy's, a gas station, maybe visit the William S. Hart Museum. None of those locations is likely to have the wherewithal to provide the toileting facilities my son would need. But a network of rest areas with powered adult changing tables would accommodate us and anyone else traveling throughout the state.

How much money would circulate in the economy, be generated in sales tax, support local business if more families with complex needs could just get out of their houses? I wish I could give you statistics. The commenters you've already heard from represent just a fraction of those who have tried to live life out in the world with their families. Imagine how many don't even try.",,,,,,,

My oldest son, whom is now 6 years old, is cognitively delayed for his age, and currently at the developmental age level of about a 1 year old. His diagnoses include severe nonverbal autism, sensory modulation disorder, epilepsy, and a rare brain disease known as periventricular nodular heterotopia. As a result of these medical conditions, our son is still in diapers and more than likely will be for the entirety of his life. Currently, our son weighs over 50lbs, making him exceed the safe weight restriction of an infant sized changing table; typically, in our restrooms across the country, these style of changing tables are the only tables in rest stops, and are typically shoved in a corner to save space. If we were to attempt to utilize these tables with our child, not only do we have a safety risk with exceeding the weight guidelines, but the tables are too short for our child's size, thus causing his head, arms, and legs to dangle. With his autism, this sensation of hanging off causes a great issue with his sensory processing, causing him to flail and increasing that fall risk. It is also extremely unsafe if he were to have a seizure while on one of these tables during a diaper change. Being that we have to travel hours across our state of Michigan to see specialists for our son's medical condition, we do inevitably have to change his diaper at some point. With these barriers in place, our only options are to change him on the floor of these public restrooms, which poses an incredible health risk of infection with his weak immune system, or if the weather allows, attempt to change him publicly in the back of our vehicle openly in a public parking lot; this latter option becomes increasingly difficult as our son ages because it risks indecent exposure, but we now also have to travel with large medical items, such as his adaptive stroller, which take up a huge amount of space. Both options are completely degrading and dehumanizing to our child. I am asking that the USDOT please consider universally-sized (adult-sized) height adjustable changing tables in rest stops across the country. Having a table that is universally-sized will allow usage for persons of any age, ranging from infants to elderly. The height-adjustable capabilities will allow caregivers to safely lift their loved ones onto these tables as well, reducing the fall risk for the user, and reducing unnecessary injuries to the caregiver. Height-adjustable capabilities are absolutely necessary for caregivers such as myself, who cannot safely lift their family member due to their own medical conditions. Having access to these tables would remove barriers for so many families and allow for travel across the United States for either recreational purposes such as tourism, to visit family, or to seek medical care. Being able to travel more frequently and further than the ""norm"" for families like ours would also allow us to invest in the economy outside of our immediate areas, which is something that would positively impact so many businesses, especially after the effects of the covid-19 pandemic. I sincerely thank you for your time and consideration on this matter, and hope that this suggestion can be implemented and made into a reality so our great nation may become more inclusive and welcoming for all of its citizens, regardless of disability, and for those visiting. Thank you. ",,,,,,,

Many families are currently unable to travel and enjoy time away from home because they do not have access to a safe, clean space in which to change their child or family member with a disability. This could actually be any one of us at any moment in our life. A medical emergency or accident could force us to become one of these individuals who is completely dependent on another for all of their personal care needs.

Dear US Department of Transportation:

Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety (CARS) is an independent, national non-profit organization dedicated to preventing motor vehicle-related fatalities, injuries and economic losses. CARS has successfully spearheaded enactment of numerous laws in California and other states, and federally, to improve protections for American motorists and all who share the roads, particularly benefiting moderate and low-income consumers and communities of color.

The President of CARS has repeatedly testified before Congress on behalf of the public interest regarding auto safety, auto financing, and related issues, at the invitation of Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle.

In order to advance racial equity and support underserved communities, a top priority for the U.S. DOT should be to support passage of federal legislation introduced by Senators Blumenthal, Markey, and Warren (S1835) to prohibit car dealers from selling, loaning, or leasing dangerous unrepaired recalled used vehicles to retail customers, and to require auto manufacturers to compensate car dealers for prolonged delays in obtaining repair parts to remedy safety recalls. This potentially lifesaving measure is supported by a widespread coalition of consumer, safety, economic / racial justice, and labor organizations.

Detailed comments are attached. Also attached is a letter from the coalition working to support passage of S1835.

Thank you for your consideration. If I can provide any assistance in your deliberations, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.

Respectfully submitted,

This does not take into account radically different costs of living and what ""low-income"" means in different parts of the country. I live and work in San Francisco, CA. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 2021 Income Limits define a family of 4 in San Francisco County as low-income if household income is less than $146,350, and extremely low-income if household income is less than $54,800 . Thus, using $26,500 as the low-income threshold for EJ Analyses on projects in San Francisco is not instructive. The DOT guidance on EJ and NEPA should be updated to recommend use of more accurate local data sources to determine low-income status of project populations when conducting EJ analyses. HUD appears to do a very thorough analysis each year to determine county by county income limits for low-income families. It seems use of this local data would be more appropriate for EJ Analyses than the more static average provided by the Department of Health and Human Services poverty guidelines.",,,,,,,

I would like to add this comment to my previous comment on the proposed Texas Central High-speed rail project that uses a proprietary ridership report in the NEPA EIS process.  FRA is not even allowed to see this report, even though they based all of the air quality emissions calculations on this report (quite badly, as you can see in my previous comment).  

It is unprecedented that FRA use a secret ridership and revenue report, FRA included a public ridership and revenue report in the NEPA EIS process for another private enterprise - All-Aboard Florida (Brightline) (Appendix 3.3-F).

Secret ridership reports should never be allowed to be used in a NEPA process.

I am concerned that the Department seeks to define a measurable vision of equity and then impose that vision, without further input, on the communities whose interests it intends to promote.  I see this as a mistake for two reasons:

(1) Conceptions of equity are diverse and rife with historical contingencies that are specific to different communities.  Any single notion of measurable ""equity"" that is determined by the Department will be open to criticism in each application as excluding one notion of equity or another for that particular transportation project.

(2) Considerations of equity are highly contextual and dependent on the facts of the particular issue or project at hand.  A tool or measurement to evaluate equity in one context is often widely considered objectionable when it is applied to another context.

One example of (1) was considered by philosopher and policy scholar Henry Richardson in his 2002 book, ""Democratic Autonomy,"" where he considers how the Department should define ""transportation systems accessible to the disabled and avoiding discrimination against the disabled"" (Richardson, p. 108).  Crucial to that consideration was bringing in perspectives from the community of disabled persons to help define the meaning and goals of ""accessible"" transportation systems, rather than imposing the Department's vision on the community.

Question (7) of the Department's request is particularly challenging because it does not involve any single relevant community that might be included in your deliberations.  There is no single community prepared to define equity for the diversity of projects and investments handled by the Department.

As a result of these two complications--the diversity of communities and the contextual nature of equity--it is important to build procedures of participation and deliberation into transportation decisions.  This should go beyond requests for public comment, which will draw from only a limited range of affected parties.

Rather, I recommend considering procedures that require the Department to solicit and rigorously gather the perspectives of affected parties for large transportation projects and investments.  Many innovations in deliberative procedures have recently been explored, including ""citizens' juries"" and others, which can be generally explored here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly.

Because conceptions of equity are diverse and contextual, it is crucial for the Department to build procedures to solicit those diverse perspectives on large projects through participation and deliberation with the affected communities.

It would be important to have a separate assessment on disability.
Equity in funding distribution could be assessed by comparing net effect and percentage of progress across geographic and income distribution, though it would have to take into account the possible bias from big projects, or it could be weighted by needs instead of a post hoc analysis, which would require to create a composite measure (for example taking into account time in transportation, cost and income) to weigh per capita funding. Do keep in mind this is not necessarily the best approach for maintenance, it should most definitely be on an urgent need basis right now (i.e. poor score of integrity go first no matter the greater impact unless the infrastructure is already worked around).
On transportation affordability, it is most definitely possible though it would have to be a product of income and commuting time if possible, that could be a survey but also through direct transportation statistics between different communities (obtained via capacity, ticket revenue or cameras) the size of a township or a borough, which should also be the precision level. An easy approach is (cost/income)*(commute/(freetime+commute time)).
Ideally to properly assess benefits and drawback the DOT would sponsor informal or more formal town halls along with the local officials and communities to get feedback before, during and after a project, with community leaders being important to reach in order to get a broader feedback. Now this process can also be done electronically but would have to be ensured with people on the ground to reach people with little access to IT and which can be some of the most impacted.
On the safety and security of walking and biking people, a modelisation from gis can be made to see average distance with each commodity, ideally taking into account at least bike lanes but also hopefully sidewalks, and add onto that local accident statistics for each type and each type of terrain, this can also be furthered by adding a danger coefficient in certain areas correlated with excessive distances, for example if needing a two hour walk commute, based on multiple factors (possible fatigue, less alert to vehicles, heatstrokes, more likely to be a target to a freak or wilful accident).
On granularity, the obvious scale is local, since wide disparities can be evened out in a state but they should logically still hold up state wide and nationally, i.e. greater local equity should reflect in all levels, this means that the best would probably inputting different possibilities (or actualities) of funding together, with a variety of scenarios and run multiple simulations to see the best possible distribution. Please note, however, that the systemic aspect of some inequity means a specific local analysis, by African American percentages, is necessary, and any, even local, granularity should take into account possible issues in that regard.
On pollution, though it is quite long term, epidemiology would be best, it is best to see actual outcomes, for example lung related illnesses and deaths, and additionally stratify by exposure levels, which can be done in partnership with hospitals. More mild diseases will probably not be visible given the cost of healthcare so it would be best to assort this with surveys in particular areas, preferably ones identified with very high risk/negative outcomes or with most potential to see improvements from shifts like EVs.
To ensure undeserved people are represented include them, in the design stage, in the research stage, in the data collection stage and in the consultation stage, and apply all those stages specifically to them.
on EVs, there should be one the one hand an impact study, identifying the most promising vehicles with the least net negative environmental consequences (including design and construction in the aggregate), identifying current uses of cars and how EVs compare (separated by demographics), current amount available for a car and how EV compares (similar demographic analysis), identifying knowledge about electricity ports available and electricity ports available both to gas stations and actual use with a particular eye on willingness to travel to recharge and time to recharge (also looking at it demographically), then remediate the various problems/inbalances seen, for instance by incentivizing certain cars, the installation of certain types of electricity ports (compatible with recharge time available) especially as home improvement, education...",,,,,,,

section (a): Add Immigrants to the definition of equity’
Q5: equity indices should very intentionally/directly address historic contexts that resulted in the current marginalization and inequity of not only availability but also accessibility to resources and representation at key decision-making roles and spaces
Q7: definitely include safety, beyond the traditional measure for sight distance, and mechanical features of transport planning and design, let’s also prioritized safety from a public health approach including but not limited to; harassment/assault awarernes and prevention, healthy corridors, arrested mobility, access to green spaces and effective connectivity to activity areas ….
Q8: A  simple starting point to this is to VALUE  people’s lived experiences! They know what needs are most urgent and can tell you better than a feasibility study can 
Q9: I’d suggest the same approach as stated above, TALK TO THE PEOPLE MOST IMPACTED; the issue is that they are most often the least/last to know or be consulted in the matters that most adversely impact them. 
Q10: have physical comment boxed I walkable distances within their respective neighborhood, better public notices prior to community engagement, make the questions SIMPLER to understand, and most importantly: GO TO THEM!
Q11: I’d say ANY data set that does NOT directly gather contextual information on intersectional identity is FUNDAMENTLLY FLAWED AND MISSES the point on addressing INTENTIONALLY MARGINALIZED demographics
Q13: get as detailed as you can, down to the local level, and be sure to prioritize those historically marginalized communities. 
Q14: make the DATA more ACCESSIBLE to the general public/ non-profit organizations/community organizers…
Q16: better analysis can be done by actually including professionals in you teams that have direct lived experiences/ contextual understanding on these demographics your hoping to understand, -lived experience mattes just as much as technical expertise!
Q17: evidence-based outcomes- real change is self-evident!
Q19: Hire them! Include them from the very beginning! Create access pipelines for a healthy representative workforce/professional sphere
Q20: start by evaluating accessibility to those very inequitably distributed “technological advancements”
Q21:  Prioritize public transport innovations by dis-incentivize personal vehicles- re-allocation of funding.
Q23: I’d suggest implementing training and efforts for cultural shift in “professional spaces” to be MORE INCLUSIVE, not just “PERFORMATIVELY DIVERSE”
Q24: easily accessibly minority business databases/assistance in certification processes/prioritizing the MOST historically under/un/mis-represented demographics in theses s[aces.

I have been plying my craft for the last 33-years. I will not receive the same pension benefits as my male cohorts when I hopefully some day retire. That is because I have not worked the same amount of hours over my career as my male cohorts. I would estimate that on average I have worked only 50% of the hours of the average male union electrician that got in the union when I did. There are many reasons for this discrepancy like discrimination and cronyism, but overwhelmingly the main #1 reason has been me not taking jobs to try to preserve my own mental health. Being an electrician is a  job I love and am well-suited to do.The sheer act of showing up every day and existing in a hostile work environment takes a tremendous psychological toll that can express itself with physical manifestations as well. It is not necessary that the construction crafts be hyper masculanized. Gender expression has no predictive value in sorting competent, safe, efficient, detail oriented electricians. It can however predict who will be able to endure the toxic culture of the construction site. Doing electrical work brings me great joy and satisfaction, but I only take work when I am desperate for money to live because that is how much I loathe the environment. Through my many years of experience I have come to the conclusion that the only way things will ever improve is for at least 25% of all construction workers on every construction site to be female. 25% is a modest amount of workers considering that women use and pay for 50% of all power utilization. By all rights they should benefit proportionately from the compensated labor necessary to provide it. But I think the environment would improve to a tolerable level if even 25% of construction workers were women. I understand it is difficult to recruit females to do construction work. I can testify that it is not because of the work itself or the compensation it is because women can see how they would be treated and what the work environment would be. They can intuit what effect that would have on their mental health. So the make a decision to do a job that they may not love as much and may not pay as well, but it will not subject them to a lifetime of psychological anguish and suffering. The only way to move forward to a more equitable and healthy environment for all construction workers is to increase the number of female workers from an abhorrent 3% to a more respectable yet not wholly equitable 25%. Armed with this information, policy makers should require quotas in funding bills. The work force hired with the money the citizens outlay should closely reflect the gender and racial make up of the citizenry themselves.Furthermore policy makers should ensure that these workers hired to fulfill a quota are not just thrown into a situation unprepared and destined to fail and thus reinforcing the stereotype that only white males should be construction workers. To this end, training, monitoring, and support most also be included as part of any funding bill. Sound judgement must be exercised with the ultimate goal of diversifying the construction workforce in order to unleash its full potential.",,,,,,,

My interest is in 1) measuring the proposals for transportation improvements versus the results, and 2) ensuring the real stakeholders (i.e. the taxpayers) are treated in an equitable fashion.

1) For all their bad press, highways are amazingly productive and efficient. Do you see unused interstates lying about? No. Do you see massive cost overruns on roadway construction? No. Anyone and everyone has access to the roads, and the goods and services of the economy use them. You can't say that about public transit. Ridership estimates are massively inflated to justify expenditures. And afterwards, there is no ""justice"" when the ridership is fractions of what was sold to the public. There needs to be direct, painful accountability in the public sector. In Northern California, when BART was extended to SFO, the implementation was ""money is no object"", ""we don't need to consider other transportation improvements"", and ""lying to the public is OK"". Why are these obviously incompetent, duplicitous civil servants allowed to continue with their careers? (Example) Caltrain improvements are the laughing stock of the world. (A) Over $200 million spent on PTC (Positive Train Control hardware and software) that is unique to Caltrain, doesn't work, is discarded, and the effort starts completely over. (B) The worlds most expensive per-mile, most delayed rail electrification project. Literally, a single ""improvement"" can provide lifetime job security, payrchecks, pensions, and benefits for folks. 
2) Too many public transportation projects have a budget that says ""the feds will pay for whatever we want"". California High Speed Rail literally is spending money as fast as possible because it is afraid the spigot from Washington may get cut off. CAHSR has no real goal of providing transportation to the states' population centers (coastal Northern and Southern California). It is a train ""from almost nowhere to almost nowhere"". If the electric power and rolling stock are installed, you won't need more than your fingers and toes to count the ridership. And there is zero/nada/zip cost containment. 

The tolerance for mediocrity in public works is astounding. And, because the number of private rail lines and private urban bus systems is nil, the taxpayer is 99% of the money. ""Farebox recovery"" is equivalent to ""the n- word"". Literally, it is impossible to be too cynical about how much the taxpayer is abused by all levels of government in this realm. I will finish with a quote from a well-known politician:

 Willie Brown, former SF mayor, San Francisco Chronicle - July 28, 2013
""News that the Transbay Terminal is something like $300 million over budget should
not come as a shock to anyone. We always knew the initial estimate was way under the
real cost. Just like we never had a real cost for the [San Francisco] Central Subway or
the [San Francisco-Oakland] Bay Bridge or any other massive construction project. So
get off it. In the world of civic projects, the first budget is really just a down 
payment. If people knew the real cost from the start, nothing would ever be approved. 
The idea is to get going. Start digging a hole and make it so big, 
there's no alternative to coming up with the money to fill it in.""

I believe public bathroom access is a basic right that should not be denied to people simply because they have a disability, however this is the case in most places. If you think of a handicapped bathroom stall, it is only accessible for someone that is still able to physically use a toilet. For thousands of disabled Americans this is not the case. They are incontinent (not able to use a toilet) and when in public need to be changed by a caregiver. Public bathrooms typically only have a changing table for a baby (with a weight limit) meaning all of these people are left without access to restroom facilities. No one should be forced to lay on a bathroom floor, or stay home all together because of lack of appropriate facilities. We need height adjustable, adults sized changing tables in public building so all Americans have access to bathrooms. 
Sincerely,
Sandy Bush (mother to a disabled child)",,,,,,,

As a 31 year transportation professional working with small and large MPOs at both a transit/transportation planning and director roles, I have seen many planning actions and infrastructure decisions driven by federal policy and funding which have transformed communities and the lives of millions of individuals and families. Many positive economic and social outcomes in the U.S. are driven by federal transportation programs. We have also transformed the country during the past 50 years to become almost entirely dependent on the automobile and production of oil. The U.S. economy has created enormous opportunities during my lifetime. Baby Boomers and Generation X have experienced incredible benefits but the long term results of these programs, policies and actions, that are automobile dominant, will not be shared equally with future generations. In addition millions of Americans continue to lead lives altered by federal policy. I support the Biden/Harris administration's actions to advance equity, housing and climate actions more aggressively. USDOT should be focused on creating a country, in perpetuity, that will resemble the conditions which have existed in the 20th century but with greater shared benefits. Transportation plans focus on a 25 year horizon. We should be building communities and infrastructure that are competitive today, and livable, 25, 50 and 100 years in the future. Our goal should be generations living affordably, healthy and sustainable lives in cities, suburbs and rural areas. I ask that USDOT review the American Planning Association (APA) Policy Guides which have been recently reviewed and updated by groups of experienced, professional planners across the US. Most notably APA updated Policy Guides in the past two years for Surface Transportation, Equity, Housing and Climate Change. I helped develop and reviewed these documents and I support the APA Board, who adopted these guides to support the decisions of local, state and federal elected officials and planners and other practitioners. Thank you again for undertaking this effort to review Transportation Equity Data. ",,,,,,,

We need to view regulatory analysis conducted by the DOT in plain language: a cost or a benefit.

The DOT uses the word ""disbenefits"" to disguise the policy picture (especially when loss of life is an negative externality on a rulemaking). They do this by grouping it and aggregating it will benefits to create a positive net benefit picture for policy decisions.

GreenLatinos believes cleaner and more equitable transportation infrastructure presents huge potential to significantly improve health and wellbeing for all people, with particular positive impact in Latino and other communities of color who bear the brunt of emissions effects. Transportation can also create substantive economic and social gains by improving mobility and access for all.

Transportation service, commute time, environmental health, and economic mobility data all can be pivotal in identifying and addressing inequities in transportation. Much of this data also exists -- collected by the Census, transit agencies, and research institutions -- but financial investment in consistent data collection and expanding its reach / refining the scale (essentially, taking all steps possible to produce data that is richer in detail and stronger in establishing correlative relationships) is crucial to advancing racial equity and better serving underserved communities.

A research team at the University of South Florida's Center for Urban Transportation Research developed a toolkit to fill gaps in current practice that contribute to inequities in the transportation system. Methods and tools developed were designed to advance equity in transportation for underserved communities. This toolkit most closely aligns with the RFI section Methods and Assessment Tools to Measure Equity questions #1, #3, #4, #5, #7, and #8.

Summary: The Transportation Equity Toolkit is a resource for MPOs, transportation agencies, and communities as they work to advance equity in traditionally underserved communities. It provides a framework for a transportation equity needs assessment and an equity-based project identification and prioritization process. A variety of tools and methods are provided for these frameworks, including the Transportation Equity Audit Tool - a survey-based tool designed for use by agency staff, community organizers, and community members in identifying community transportation needs from an equity perspective; and the Transportation Equity Scorecard Tool - a spreadsheet tool to assist the staff of MPOs and other transportation planning agencies in prioritizing projects that advance equity. 

The precursory report, Integrating Equity into MPO Project Prioritization, documents and synthesizes methods currently used by MPOs to address equity when prioritizing transportation projects and addressing access to opportunities for underserved communities. This report includes invaluable information that addresses question #12 in the RFI. 

Summary:  Integrating Equity into MPO Project Prioritization explores thirty-five case examples across the nation and reviews numerous project prioritization methods that are relevant to equity. It identifies notable practices for prioritizing equity and access to opportunity for underserved communities used by MPOs of different sizes and governance structures.

No one relay on any federal transportation in the country. We’re responsible enough to take care of ourselves.

BUT, with/without tolls, cars should be penalized when they travel these lanes much like if trucks use the express lanes.  With accidents, traffic and construction, trucks have no quick alternative when forced to avoid the downtown route.  A fast track bypass would be nice and allow a diversion for not only locals, travelers, trucks and allow for much needed repairs to our nations interstates.  It’s a shame that our whole country’s interstate infrastructure is in shambles and a bad reflection on our nation, state and local communities.  While we face an uncertain future, health wise & financially, public transit is a must for those who have access and the need, the fact is that most ppl who have their own cars will never use it unless as a last resort.  Those who typically use it are those on low or fixed incomes and are forced to due to necessity, not desire!

The Johns Hopkins Center for Injury Research and Policy strongly supports the objectives of Executive Order 13985 and of efforts being undertaken by the Department of Transportation to assess the implications of federal transportation programs on equity and underserved communities.  
 
We recommend that the Department consider the effects of road safety on transportation and health equity.   As public health professionals we are acutely aware of the unfair burden that traffic crashes place on underserved communities and the far-reaching effects that crashes, traffic risks, and limited access to safe transportation infrastructure have on members of these communities. 
 
We further recommend that the Department take steps to implement the Safe System approach through federal transportation programs as a means to improve both safety and equity.  The Center for Injury Research and Policy recently partnered with the Institute of Transportation Engineers and representatives of about 20 national transportation and public health organizations to develop consensus recommendations for federal policy and programs to advance implementation of the Safe System approach.  
 
The attached report from this Safe System Consortium presents a range of specific recommendations for federal policy. Among these are recommendations for the development of new measures of the benefits of safer roads to underserved communities, including impacts on safety and health equity and access to health determinants such as education, employment and health care services.  
 
We appreciate your efforts to address transportation equity and respectfully request that the Department consider the attached Recommendations of the Safe System Consortium in its implementation of Executive Order 13985. 
 
Sincerely,

The equity analyses done by agencies in this area are not adequate and need to be revised. Capital Metro, the local transit agency, follows the requirements for Title VI for new projects, and says that it is in compliance; but many members of the underserved communities do not think the transit service is equitable. The Capital Area MPO (CAMPO) and TxDOT follow formulaic requirements for equity consideration, and do not do any meaningful equity analyses or policy implementation. There is a significant need for improvements in provision of equitable transportation. A few specific recommendations follow.

1. Data analysis should include existing conditions and historical inequities. If a new project is built in a way that meets Title VI, the outcome can still be inequitable if it builds on existing inequities.

2. Collect data on access not only to employment but also to essential services, such as groceries, health care and social services. Many underrepresented people do not work 9 to 5, so data on employment access should include their needs for transportation at other times.

3. Conduct in-person surveys with bus riders. Although other forms of data collection are more efficient, the essential views of bus riders are often overlooked.

4. Collect data on people with disabilities who do not use MetroAccess. Most people with disabilities rely on the fixed bus service, but often have special needs that are not accounted for.

5. There should be more data collection on a micro level. Many people in the community complain about specific local conditions like having to climb a long hill to make a transfer, or living in an area that is high crime so feeling unsafe at the bus stop. That level of detail is usually not included in the data, but is essential for equity considerations.

6. Data should be collected from bus riders on ability to pay. Decision-makers assume fares are reasonable based on regional statistics, but many bus riders complain that they have difficulty affording the fares.

7. CAMPO and TxDOT should be required to work with community groups in the region to understand equity concerns and address them.",,,,,,,

It is important to recognize that automobiles took roads away from other users over the past 100 years because of a bias towards these more affluent users.  Redressing this wrong is challenging because drivers don't recognize that this wrong needs to be righted.  They feel entitled to free parking in public rights of way and oppose bike lanes and shared use paths that take away ""their"" parking. How many bike-ped projects have been killed because citizens didn't want to give up ""free"" parking, and how has impacted households without a car? Generally, people pay for parking in the inner cities but not the suburbs. This is effectively a tax on people in more dense neighborhoods. Our whole approach to parking should be studied in the context of equity.
There is inequity in data collection. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics frequently reports on airline and freight activity, but rarely on self-powered modes of travel.  Why do they track mileage of all classes of roadways but not shared use paths, all types of bike lanes and sidewalks? There should be a comprehensive review of the data collected by BTS and self-powered modes should be added across all appropriate categories.
State transportation plans include intermodal activities but there is rarely much emphasis on bike/ped. This results in most people equating intermodal with transit. There should be a requirement that bike/ped travel is treated equally in these planning efforts. ",,,,,,,

In the past and currently, DOT has significantly limited funding for 5310 Agencies. There must be changes in the laws. DOT must greatly improve the financial support of these transportation companies that serve as a solution to advancing racial equality.

Opportunities to do better:
- Equitable access impact studies can influence future proposed highway construction in order to increase access to affordable housing, education, employment, and social services.  Such studies must include:
1.	Comprehensive analysis of demographic data at all stages of the project.  
a.	Equity indicators contained within this analysis should be easy to understand and require data that is reasonable easy to obtain.

2.	Analysis of whether a project will comply with principles of transportation justice (Environmental Justice).
a.	Accessibility
b.	Affordability
c.	Public Health & Safety
d.	Equity

3.	Deep and meaningful community engagement with low-income and other historically excluded residents.
a.	Evaluative & substantive involvement

4.	Broad enough geographic scope to best capture the full impact of the project

5.	Exploration of strategies to mitigate any of the project’s discriminatory effects
a.	targeted investment combined with incentives
b.	community benefit agreements
c.	transit oriented development

- Example of Equity Objectives and their indicators:
Objective:  Disadvantaged communities should have a larger share of the project’s benefits
Indicator:  Affordable housing is available and accessible

Objective:  Benefits should be transferred to the affected communities
Indicator:  Transportation policies and planning decisions support access

- Data sources useful for equity analysis
1.	Government agency budgets and reports that indicate public expenditures
2.	Census and surveys
3.	Audits of the ability of transport facilities and services to accommodate people with disabilities and other special needs
4.	Analysis of the degree to which disadvantaged people are considered and involved in transport planning.
5.	Reports on the frequency of special problems by disadvantaged travelers (faulty equipment, inaccurate information, inconsiderate treatment by staff, etc.), the frequency of complaints by disadvantaged travelers, and the responsiveness of service providers to such complaints.

I am a Montanan with a disability  as well as a longtime transportation and infrastructure advocate,I  submit  these comments to The United States Department of Transportation  regarding this Request for Information : Transportation Equity Data.  as a person who live in a  rural  frontier state, I want to See both traditional infrastructure and connectivity  gaps   made  mobility as well sensorially accessible for all.  Being a rural and frontier before cOVID-19 left Montana was successes and challenges. We have small fleets in airlines  transit  Systems and other forms  of infrastructure.  on a national and state level mini government agencies including the Access Board, US DOTNBT and the Montana legislature have been talking about autonomous self driving vehicles as well as mobility management assets systems Uber and lift and taxis however, while many of us with disabilities  are excited by future prospects the systems will provide,   many struggle because our present connectivity and infrastructure is aging and or is not connected and accessible  to all not  only in a  disability  framework  but in an economic  development framework  as well. For example, many of our Developmental Disabilities  providers in montana  often  struggle with insurance issues and securing federal match rates! does this have an intended or intended consequences which may lead to disparities and discrimination to and toward various groups trying to access public transit? even over the road buses in Montana have had connectivity issues with larger states or urban locales. Because of economic demand and driving across  states, Montanans often have accessibility issues with over the road busing. On data collection, Montana needs collections about pedestrian safety, how we access tribal nations and improve and  redesign  Transportation diversity.  Many of Montana’s communities are in  co operative situations or dire need of infrastructure services ! As USDOT knows ,Montana is and has traditionally been  based upon  natural resources and agricultural economics systems  Throughout America, DOT needs to ensure that our sovereign nations and tribal nations are represented in our infrastructure planning and workforce in the transit  and tourism industries. we need to ensure that our sovereign nations and infrastructure building do not destroy historically  as well as  culturally significant sites in  states and on federal  lands .America needs to examine infrastructure funding  that we have historically used and  are presently using  to determine whether funding sources 
 will allow for innovative programs and services in infrastructure without promoting  racial inequality  as well as inequity barriers and discriminatory practices for all. As a citizen ,I would hope that the next highway bill or transportation bill would examine programs that were previously  allocated apportionments in  SAFTEALU and bring  funding forward   as  stand alone  programsi.e.   such as JARC and New Freedom funding .

On top of car crashes that kill thousands of Americans and severely injure millions more every year, air pollution from our fossil-fuel powered cars, trucks and other vehicles can lead to a variety of illnesses, including asthma and lung cancer.

Beyond causing us suffering on a personal level, America’s transportation system is also harming the planet. Transportation is now the number one source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. and the single largest contributor to the global climate crisis. That means our vehicles are causing more extreme temperatures, shifting weather patterns and an increased prevalence of deadly diseases around the world.

And yet we keep driving ourselves deeper into this hole - traveling more than 3.2 trillion miles by car each year while state and local governments spend tens of billions of dollars’ on new and expanded highways that will divide our communities, while likely failing to achieve meaningful transportation goals.

The science is clear: Highway expansion doesn’t solve traffic congestion. It makes it worse. Not only does widening our highways trap us in our cars, it also increases the amount of harmful pollution going into our lungs and the climate. Time and again, the theory of “induced demand,” has shown that highway expansions ultimately become congested shortly after new lanes are added.

We don’t need more highway lanes. We need more electrified public transit, expanded bike lanes and safe walking infrastructure, so people can live more and drive less. This was true before the COVID-19 crisis, and it will still be true after the crisis is over. As we emerge from the pandemic, we can't return to the transportation status quo that focused on moving people instead of cars. Instead, we need to work to take cars off our roads and get people onto healthier, more efficient and more sustainable modes of transportation.

CCBO Response to US DOT E.O.
The Coalition of Capacity Building Organizations (CCBO) is a team of qualified and experienced construction industry Capacity Building Program experts throughout the US and internationally. The CCBO members share the common objective of providing Management and Technical Assistance and Training to the Small Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Businesses (S/M/W/DBE) owners as well as Community Residents. 
The purpose of the organization is to: (1) Promote contract procurement opportunities for MBE Contractors in the public and private sectors, (2) Provide local advocacy for legislation and government actions concerning M/D/SBE’s, (3) Provide education and training to minority and economically disadvantaged communities that comprise current and future employees, and (4) work towards improving the economic and natural environment of the communities in which they live and work.

The CCBO has and will continue to address President Biden’s Executive Order and the US Department of Transportation’s priority of “Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities.” CCBO will utilize its various Contractor Capacity Building Program (CBP) processes combined with the resources of its core members, numerous Collaborative Partners and Major Corporate Partners and Owners toward achieving these goals. Three of the numerous CCBO members responding to this US DOT RFI are as follows:

1. Transportation systems should provide everyone—regardless of age, income, or disability—with viable choices, whether or not they own a car. Transportation should ensure that people in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color have opportunities to fully participate in the regional economy.
 2. Transportation infrastructure should provide effective job access to all workers, including populations which have historically faced barriers to employment.
3. Transportation investments, decided in transparent, accountable, and democratic ways, should extend quality transportation options to all the communities in a region, in a way that reflects each community’s character and its long-term plans.  
4. In the interests of community health, transportation policy should increase options for walking and bicycling by improving pedestrian safety, reducing air pollution, and creating better transit connections to health services. 
5. Transportation investments should enable metropolitan development that is based on transit use and greater walkability, promoting environmental sustainability by reducing vehicle miles traveled, decreasing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and conserving energy. The costs of attaining sustainability in transportation, as reflected in fees, taxes, and the price of energy, should be allocated equitably across all populations.

Here's a great recent study that undertook that type of analysis and found that 75 percent of the most fatal corridors for walkers were located in low-income neighborhoods, and that predominantly BIPOC neighborhoods were also significantly over represented. http://jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/view/1825 A handful of specific road design features were common to virtually all of the hotspots, and a more robust set of data analyzing crash context could be instrumental in building the case for better infrastructure policy. 

Along the same lines, here's another recent article offering suggestions for reforms to federal crash reporting standards: https://usa.streetsblog.org/2021/07/20/why-u-s-car-crash-reporting-is-broken/. At the minimum, states should be required to adhere to minimum data collection standards outlined in the MMUCC, and the MMUCC itself should be significantly revised to more accurate capture data on the most significant drivers of our pedestrian death crisis, which disproportionately effects BIPOC, low-income people and the elderly.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on this docket, pertaining to a Request for Information on Transportation Equity Data. This conversation is critical to recognize, identify, mitigate, and recalibrate historic exclusionary practices in the U.S. transportation program. 
We understand there are key questions that the docket requests feedback on. However, we must highlight overarching feedback on the topic of equity in the transportation system. The Department can make significant headway by viewing and applying its mission holistically toward equity and inclusion. 
Equity is a concept that cannot be layered onto the current state of the transportation practice. Practitioners across the spectrum of government (from local, regional, state, and federal) implementing the transportation program have viewed and interpreted equity and environmental justice as just an additional step in the planning, implementation, and operation process. More often than not, any mention or measures of equity and environmental justice in the transportation planning process has been documented in a separate chapter, rather than incorporated throughout the process dialogue. As a result, we have made insignificant progress toward addressing equity and inclusion. 
Far too long has the program focused on vehicles, vehicle speed, and through traffic. That leaves out those who cannot afford or have abstained from a personal vehicle. The focus on vehicle speed imposes safety risks to those traveling within the community on foot, bike, or other means of transportation. The focus on vehicle speed instead of people - the community’s most valuable asset - imposes barriers to economic opportunities. More often than not, the current transportation program has left in its wake marginalized, historically excluded communities. 
Realizing true benefits equitably for all users of the transportation system will involve a fundamental adjustment to the state of the practice. From purpose and needs statements, scoping guidance, design measures and standards, project prioritization, to performance indicators, there needs to be a focus of people underpinning the transportation program. We want to emphasize that none of these steps require authorization from Congress. They simply require the Department to update its own approach and directives. ",,,,,,,

Transit is quickly becoming a multi-modal multi-provider of services, where people can take a demand response circulator, bikeshare, or shuttle route to transfer to a higher-frequency fixed route (rail, BRT, limited stop or local bus route).  That circulator, shuttle or route may be operated through a contract using dedicated or (for circulators) undedicated vehicles.
Transit Equity allows all non-incarcerated and competent adults who don't drive access to post-secondary education, work, healthcare, grocery stores, and community life (recreation, religious activities, etc).
Most of the 130 federal programs subsidizing rides are purpose-driven. A particular clientele group is enabled to reach a constricted list of destinations to reach program-prescribed services. In combination, these programs could support Transit Equity.  Separately, they prevent transit equity.  Case in point: The IRS Commuter Benefits Program rules for 2021 which require that subsidies be constrained to ""Commuter highway vehicles"", defined as any highway vehicle that seats at least 6 adults (not including the driver)"" and derives ""at least 80% of the vehicle mileage ... transporting employees between their homes and workplace with employees occupying at least one-half the vehicle's seats (not including the driver's)."" That prevents use of rural transit systems that combine work-based rides with human service agency rides and general public transit rides.  Why mandate a separate fleet for one purpose - whether commuting, Medicaid Non Emergency Medical Transportation, or rides only for clients of Veterans Affairs, Area Area on Aging, and Disability service agencies?  This breeds duplication, inefficiency and lack of mobility options.
* Regarding Methods and Assessment Tools To Measure Equity: 
2. Allow more state flexibility in distribution of Section 5310 funds by eliminating the mandated distribution of 60% to urban areas, 20% to suburban and 20% rural areas. This constrains state/local purview. Prior to MAP-21, the majority of this funding went to rural areas. When the guidelines changed, many rural areas saw a significant drop in funding for their specialized transportation programs. In states where 5311 funding is unable to fund all applications, Section 5310 funds operate the only transportation programs in some rural areas. Changing these provisions can provide more equity among rural and urban areas.
3. Regional and Metropolitan Planning Organizations have access to Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, aggregated U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey data and can apply modal overlays.  These tools can be used, as has been demonstrated in Delaware, to compare accessibility and travel time from minority neighborhoods or low-income neighborhoods vs white or middle/high income neighborhoods to healthcare, industrial and warehousing employment (entry-level jobs), post-secondary education, and healthy food.  This analysis can be done nationwide as well as locally.
4. Virginia and Massachusetts each use a rating system to rank transportation project funding proposals by specific criteria.  These ranking systems can include public health, environmental and equity factors.  This concept can be replicated at the RPO/MPO level before including a project into the local Transportation Improvement Program.
5. Since transportation projects must be included in the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) to receive federal funding, then the appropriate geographic level is statewide.  While state governments have the latitude in defining and assessing priorities, those priorities should include:
•	Safety
•	Person Throughput (as opposed to vehicle levels of service)
•	Freight Throughput
•	Economic Opportunities (as opposed to just development)
•	Environmental Protection and Public Health
•	Support for Non-Driving Modes
8. Regional and Metropolitan Planning Organizations have access to Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, aggregated U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey data and can apply modal overlays.  These tools can be used, as has been demonstrated in Delaware, to compare accessibility and travel time from minority neighborhoods or low-income neighborhoods vs white or middle/high income neighborhoods to healthcare, industrial and warehousing employment (entry-level jobs), post-secondary education, and healthy food.  
9. This process includes the requirement for public outreach and input including use of proven crowd-sourced methods to describe and map accessibility barriers along pathways.  
15. Mandate periodic spot-check measures of air quality including particulates and NOx by facility entrances used by school buses and in neighborhoods adjacent to stationary emissions sources as well as industrial facilities.",,,,,,,

Re: Docket Number DOT-OST-2021-0036

Dear Ms. Kohl:
On Behalf of the Institute for Urban Research (IUR) at Morgan State University, an HBCU institution, I am writing you in response to the Biden administration’s commitment to, and request for, input regarding more equitable transportation policies and practices within the Federal Department of Transportation and its affiliated agencies. 
The IUR submits the following comments in response to EO 13990 and the proposed rule 86 FR 23876, docket number DOT-OST-2021-0036.  Subject to this docket my response will focus on structural inequity, a proxy for environmental injustice, with the following core components: public participation, public health, transportation, and economic development. In doing so this submittal draws from my experience working with and advocating for various methods, data, and tools for measuring the negative and positive impacts that transportation funding can have on minority communities. Strengthening both equity and environmental justice analytical methods to ensure more equitable, fairer, and nuanced planning requires research that identifies and illustrates how Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), and state DOTs can identify and address disproportionately high and adverse effects of transportation funding policy on low-income and minority populations in each of these areas.
To this end we seek to use the resources of HBCU’s to advance the equity analysis and research studies capabilities and HBCU’s ability to advance within underserved communities in general. Details on these matter follow.  Morgan State University’s Institute for Urban Research would be an effective way of increasing awareness of transportation equity and environmental justice issues, creating new tools for communities to apply, and building professional capacity in the form of a new generation of transportation professionals with the sensitivity and knowledge to produce better and more equitable transportation outcomes.

Executive Order 13985 takes the important step of acknowledging the federal government’s role in entrenching institutional inequalities as well as its responsibility to address these ongoing harms. The transportation system we have today is the result of decisions and investments that displaced communities of color and exacerbated economic inequality. Reversing these policies and creating a transportation system that advances safety, sustainability, and equity will require thoughtful legislative reforms and concerted efforts from all levels of government. This E.O. can act as a starting point for federal agencies, including USDOT, to prioritize equity across decisions, policies, and programs.

The attached recommendations and responses to USDOT’s questions are informed by NACTO member cities’ efforts to create equity frameworks, collect data on the equity implications of transportation decisions, as well as our organization's dedication to collating best practices based on these experiences.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2021-0056-0264/attachment_1.pdf",

Our research team is drafting a paper that shows that the average Black commuter faces a substantially longer commuter than the average white commuter in the United States. The goal of this to project is to measure this commuting gap, determine whether it is growing or shrinking, and uncover the factors that drive it. Our methodology combines readily available public use microdata and with relatively straightforward econometric tools, and already scaled to study both the nation as a whole as well as individual metropolitan area. 

We have attached a preliminary draft of our findings in this public comment; we anticipate releasing a complete working paper in October 2021. Preliminary analysis indicates:
•	Black commuters face longer commute times than white commuters on average. In 1980, the average Black commute time was 30% longer than the average white commute. This unconditional gap fell to about 13% by 2018. 
•	Accounting for where people live is important due to differences in commuting across regions. We assign people to commuting zones (groups of counties that form a labor market). When adjusted to reflect this, the gap compresses: the average Black commute time was 20% longer in 1980 and 5% longer in 2018. 
•	Further controlling for other characteristics, such as demographics, transportation mode, income, and occupation and industry do not completely explain the gap. After adjusting to reflect these factors, the average Black commute time was 15% longer in 1980 and 5% longer in 2018.  
•	The gap is wider at lower incomes, even accounting location and other characteristics. For those at the 10th percentile of the income distribution in 1980, commutes were about 25% longer for Black commuters. In 2018, this gap was still about 12%.
•	The gap is present even when only considering public transit. For subway riders and for bus riders, the average Black commuter in 2018 faced a 13% longer commute than the average white commuter. 

The primary data source for this project is microdata drawn from the decennial census and the American Community Survey, as curated by IPUMS (https://www.ipums.org/). Our paper details how we process and analyze the data, and we hope to release a data and code repository that can be used by others to replicate and build upon our findings. 

Our team consists of four economists and urban planners. We became aware of this RFI at the National Bureau of Economic Research’s New Directions in Transportation Economics conference in June 2021, which is supported by the US Department of Transportation through an inter-agency agreement with the National Science Foundation (grant 155903).

Where is funding now being distributed? AMI, poverty levels, racial & ethnic makeup of communities receiving the most money?
Health disparity data may be of use
Requiring an assessment of the distribution of fare revenues by payment type (Monthly passes are X% of total fare revenue) in relation to the number of pass sales of that type (X number of monthly passes were sold for $X) cross referenced with the ridership data’s demographics of those payment types (Monthly passes have X% of minorities and X% of low-income). This will show if there are any disparities in the amounts being paid by low-income or minorities in relation to overall income to an agency and assess if those populations are paying more per ride or per pass than counterparts with pass programs.

The current Title VI process provides catch-all provisions that allow for justification of any change as long as it is written out and explained. In addition to the lack of definitive violations of Title VI in the implementation of changes to fares and service, these proposed justifications are not reviewed by the funding authority until up to three years after the changes are implemented. If there were inadequate documentation/justification, there is no recourse that appears feasible.

Low Gross Revenue SBA Size Standards for Construction and Construction Related Services and DBE Personal Net Worth Caps Threaten M/WBE and DBE Growth by Providing an Artificial Data Metric That Prevents Participation and Parity in High-Cost Construction Regions

The Executive Order “ Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government” signed by President Biden on January 20, 2021 directed federal agencies to assess whether and to what extent the agency policies and programs perpetuate systemic barriers to opportunities and benefits for people of color and other underserved groups, which includes women. The Department of Transportation is seeking comments regarding available or potential data and assessment tools that could assist in the ongoing and continuous evaluation of Federal policies and programs concerning equitable services and safety in the transportation sector.

Women Builders Council (WBC) is New York’s leading advocacy organization representing women and minorities in their effort to create a fair and equal playing field for contract opportunities at the local, state and Federal levels.

Comments on DOT-OST-2021-0056
focus on Transportation Workforce Data Questions 22-25.
(5 attachments, this intro is named Comments on Transportation Equity)
 
Thank you for the opportunity to submit personal comments on DOT-OST-2021-0056, the Secretary and Department’s proactive effort to meet the intent of President Biden’s Equity EO 13985. The broad scope of questions in this RFI illustrates the complexity of DOT initiatives and assures me of Secretary Buttigieg’s serious intent. Since my life and professional experience is in registered apprenticeship (RA), my specific comments refer to Transportation Workforce Data Questions 22-25. 

Background: An affirmative action hiring in 1977 gave me the opportunity to become first female Plumbing apprentice (UA Local 167) and licensed journeyworker in the Madison, WI area. (Thanks to EO 11246, OFCCP, and USDOL-Women’s Bureau). My plumbing experience led to a 25-year career in technical education working with the full range of registered apprenticeship (RA) programs, doggedly trying to promote racial and gender equity in technical education. In retrospect, I now realize that most of the promising equity initiatives in my career were tied to either Carl Perkins Sex Equity funding or a specific DOT provision that allowed ½ of 1% of highway funds to be used for supportive services funding. One early formative example was Reagan-era ISTEA technical assistance grant that enabled Maine’s DOT to convene Tradeswomen from across the country to learn about this provision. In addition to the joy of finally meeting another female plumber, this meeting motivated me to reach out to WI-DOT regarding the ½ of 1%. A dedicated group of diverse Tradeswomen who emerged from that meeting went on to form the national Tradeswomen’s Task Force. For an excellent resource document from TWTF please refer to the attached document Ten Necessary Components to Provide Equity…). Affirmative Action goals do create opportunity.

My Wisconsin experience: Transportation sector apprenticeships consistently outperformed building trades apprenticeships in terms of female and minority participation. WI-DOT projects with Affirmative Action goals achieved those goals (while my local union continues to average one female apprentice per decade). Under friendly administrations, empowered WI-DOT staff were able to do much to strengthen equity-focused community-based organizations (CBOs) AND offer technical assistance to potential DBEs. WI-DOT staff led several exemplary interagency collaborations with on workforce equity and apprenticeship issues during 2009-2014. 

In contrast, during other administrations, I saw a tendency to lump DBE programs and minority/female workforce outreach efforts together; assuming minority contractors would take care of hiring/training/supporting all underrepresented groups. I feel this dismissive, mindset led to scam owners, business failures, and scandals that made diversity initiatives more difficult. Affirmative Action became a dirty word. I retired after seeing through the updating of 29CFR30, the DOL Equal Opportunity regs for Registered Apprenticeship, another useful tool. The tools and best practices were/are there; everyone looks the other way.

Looking back now, frankly thanks to the eloquence of Pete Buttigieg, I fully realize that the mere absence of egregious, overt discrimination will not bring about equity. Serious intent and a consistent equity message, emanating from the top, matter. I am thrilled by the Biden administration’s “all of government” approach. Serious intent matters and recent hires at partner agencies, such as Maya Raghu at OFCCP, beautifully illustrate commitment to EO 13985 Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.

Frequently, for my office, we have submitted bids at a premium to the owner only to achieve a DBE goal. 5-6 contracts per year will include a cost premium at bid time to ensure a goal is met. Premiums range from .5% to 2% of contract value. Contracts range from $500,000 to $60,000,000. 

Most recently, our company competitively bid a project and were the second place bidder by approximately $10,000. Our company included over $70,000 in premiums to the contract to achieve a DBE goal. Had been able to utilize the lowest, responsible quote for the portion of work, we would have successfully been awarded the contract with no premium to the owner.

From time to time, we have been awarded contracts after not reaching a DBE requirement and submitting adequate good faith effort documentation. However, this always comes to a premium to the owner as we place achieving a goal (or attempting to) above submitting a lower bid. 

If the department could provide feedback, tolerance ranges for premiums, or simply acknowledge the priority of either reaching a goal or submitting a lower price, it would be extremely helpful and less costly to contractors and the owner. Good faith effort documentation can take 1-2 days of multiple employees compiling, editing, reviewing and submitting the requested information. ",,,,,,,

This could be more depending upon how often we do not meet a goal and have to defend our GFE’s. This could vary widely among respondents due to electronic vs paper recordkeeping, experience of the worker and their familiarity with the program as well as possibly doing additional work that may not even be required due to ambiguity on the part of the department. GENERAL COMMENT ON THE COST OF DBE PREMIUMS AND NEEDING CLARIFICATION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF LOW BID VS OBTAINING DBE GOAL:As a contractor who frequently participates in federally assisted construction contracts, I believe clarification should be provided on the significance of achieving a DBE goal vs submitting a more competitive, lower cost bid.Frequently, cost premiums must be added to a bid to achieve the DBE goal. This cost premium is added based on the experience that in the past bids have been awarded to 2nd place bidders at a higher cost to the owner simply because a DBE goal was not met by the low bidder.  This decision is made without regard to the good faith efforts of the low bidder, but simply on the assumption that if one bidder can obtain a DBE goal all bidders should be able to obtain it the goal. In these cases, it appears there was simply no consideration given to the fact that the 2nd bidder was costing a premium. Premiums range from .5% to 2% of the contract value. Contracts range in size from $500,000 to $10,000,000. We also have to make good business decisions based on our previous use of a DBE, if we have had previous experiences with a certain DBE, that have shown that are not the high level of quality contractor we need on projects, we would not be as likely to use them over a competitively priced, high quality, non-DBE competitor. These factors are hard to argue in a good faith effort discussion as the department simply uses an approved list of DBE's as their determining factor as to if the DBE is competent and capable. Most recently, we have bid projects and were the second-place bidder due to premiums added to the our bid to achieve a DBE goal. Had we been comfortable that the contract would be awarded based on good faith effort utilizing the lowest, responsible quote for each portion of work, we would have successfully been low bidder on projects with no premium to the owner. If the department could provide feedback, such as tolerance ranges for DBE premiums, or simply acknowledge the priority of either reaching a goal vs submitting a lower price, it would be extremely helpful and less costly to contractors and the owner. We feel that currently much of our industry sees the DBE goal as more of a mandate and is fearful that good faith effort reviews will be based strictly on comparison to other bidders and government checklist rather than an actual conversation and understanding of our efforts, decisions and the reasons for such.  Good faith effort documentation often takes 1-2 days of multiple employees compiling, editing, reviewing and submitting the requested information. GENERAL COMMENT ON THE SETTING OF DBE GOALS FOR INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS:In the state where we perform contracting, we have been blessed the last few years to have a very substantial amount of contract opportunities. This is also a curse for DBE participation, we are losing DBE participation for 3 main reasons: 1. Companies are ""graduating"" from the program and there are not replacements in the same line of work. 2. Companies are simply too busy and cannot perform the volume of work that is currently available, at this point they have to self-evaluate whether they want to graduate from the program or limit their volume to maintain their DBE status, 3. Geographics/demographics vary extremely in a relatively short distance, there simply may not be adequate DBE companies for a particular region.  Even though many DBE’s indicate they will work in the entire state, if there is work in their local region they will not travel to other areas of the state.Even though we have lost program participants, goals seem to be either at a standstill or increasing. Two things concern me on this front: 1. Sole sourcing and 2. Loss of internal volume. I had to end my comments here due to lack of space, on these last two topics. However, I have emailed a copy to Martha Kinley as well as attached the word file for review with all comments added. Seems unfair that we are only given 5000 characters to respond to a docket of a length of 5 pages.

Though we’ve seen the program work well, we also notice some things that absolutely need to improve. To name a few - DBE contractor performance, quality, and safety and how this plays a role in GFE. We’ve experienced DBE Contractors who have performed poorly or not performed at all. The costs for us to supplement the subcontracted work by either self-performing the remaining portion, or hiring another contractor – have been born by us a General Contractor and have been substantial and accumulative. Provisions in the GFE process need to be included to allow contractors the ability to make our own business decisions without fear of losing a public contract because a goal was not met – for when a contractor we elect to not do business with (based on previous experiences) is the only pathway for achieving the goal. There are many times we feel the DBE goals force us to make business decisions we wouldn’t make otherwise. 

Our organization exhausts all efforts in obtaining or exceeding project DBE goals, and a lot of time this results in increased costs for the taxpayers and funding entities. In addition, when these premium dollars are added to our bid – we put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage when our competitors do not include the additional premium dollars. We have lost bids by amounts smaller than the premiums we’ve included to reach the DBE goals. Premiums have reached as much as 2% on projects up to $100m. We’ve seen projects awarded to contractors who did not meet the project specific DBE goal, even though we were able to obtain the goal on the same contract. Consideration should be given to clarify or provide parameters when contractors weigh achieving the DBE goal vs a  low cost bid. ",,,,,,,

Air Canada fails, and has consistently failed, to justify the flight cancellations with government imposed restrictions barring it from operating flights. Any such restrictions certainly deterred air traffic, but never legally prevented it. Air Canada continues to mislead the DOT and its customers with this fictitious and frivolous argument. Air Canada, using its own arguments, contradicts this argument by providing a link to ""Minimizing the Risk of Exposure to
COVID-19 in Canada Order (Prohibition of Entry into Canada from the United States),
GOVERNMENT OF CANADA - https://orders-in-council.canada.ca/attachment.php?attach=38958&lang=en"" which CLEARLY states that the order only applies to foreign nationals, i.e. does not apply to Canadian citizens [3(1)] and US citizens are exempted from the order [4(2)]

Air Canada does not explain how they were forced to cancel flights and by what authority ""Air Canada was forced to cancel many transborder flights
between the United States and Canada""

Air Canada references CTA regulations and the APPR which are irrelevant to these proceedings as they are Canadian in nature. In any case, Canadian courts have found that the CTA statement on vouchers has no enforceability.

Air Canada conflates ""refund"" and ""credit"" or ""voucher"" or ""Aeroplan miles"" which are completely different things, none of which equivalent to full restitution of monies paid for services not provided, and the latter of the three is laughable as miles to dollar ratios are microscopic. Note that Air Canada has the gall to argue the vagueness of the term ""unfair"" while also blatantly misappropriating the term ""refund"". 

We request that the Department at the very least force Air Canada to explicitly define what ""non-refundable"" fare means in its future tariffs. It is ludicrous to expect a consumer to understand that a service provider can make a promise to provide a service, take money for that promise, not deliver the service, then keep the money. Any other commercial entity doing this would be sued and tried for fraud and theft.

""Substantial harm"" is in the eye of the beholder. Not refunding my 300$ ticket caused me substantial harm. 

""customers bargained for Air Canada’s practices and made free and informed choices to purchase non-refundable tickets after being made aware of their limitations."" Air Canada blames its customers for expecting it to provide the service paid for. Imagine that.

Lack of demand for flights as a result of COVID-19 is not a justification for holding customers' money hostage for over a year. Lack of Canadian government support to Air Canada is not a justification for holding customers' money hostage for over a year.",,,,,,,

the proposal to limit travel between the US and Belarus following their hijacking of the Ryan Air flight to abduct journalist Raman Pratasevich. I applaud the Biden Administration and Secretary Blinken for wishing to penalize the corrupt authorities in Belarus, but I fear that this proposal will instead only penalize regular everyday of Belarus, or Americans with personal connections to Belarus, such as myself.

I don't see how preventing an airline such as Delta or KLM or Turkish Airlines from selling a ticket to an American for travel to Minsk will in anyway discourage their government from oppressing its people. The economic impact would be minimal, so it serve as a mostly symbolic gesture.

However, for Belarusians living in the US it might become impossible to travel home, given the current covid restrictions in the EU. Similarly, for Americans with friends and family in Belarus it will become impossible to visit. I say this selfishly because I am in love with a girl who lives in Belarus, but I also think there is a bigger picture here.

This prohibition would strain personal relationships--many of which have already become severed due to the pandemic--and ultimately will only increase the divide between the people of Belarus and the West (which pushes them closer to Russia). This is the opposite of what we should be supporting. Rather we should be encouraging as much interaction between everyday people in Belarus and their Western European and American counterparts. 

It was precisely through travel and exposure to democratic ideas and ideals over the past decade that the people of Belarus found the courage to protest and demand more from their leaders last summer. A de facto travel ban between the US and Belarus might risk erasing the progress that has naturally occurred. Perhaps more importantly, it is horribly unfair to ask the citizens of both countries to bare such a cost for the actions of a lunatic dictator. 

As ambassadors of democratic values throughout the world, the United States has a duty to encourage free travel across all borders for law abiding citizens. Sure, prevent individuals in the Belarusian government from traveling to the United States, I'm all for that. But we make a much more compelling case for joining the West when we model the benefits of a free society and allow the citizens of other countries to demand change for themselves. 

Again, please rethink this proposal.

If anything, you should do the opposite and increase flights between our countries. Then you should grant non-governmental Belarusian citizens political asylum in the US. The way to break a dictator is not through sanctions or limitations; it is through offering his people the thing which he cannot: the benefits of liberty and self-determination.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I have recently learned about the aforementioned proposal of the department of transportation to prohibit flights between USA and Belarus. And I would like to share my concerns.

I am a naturalized US citizen, I was born in Belarus, big part of my family lives in Belarus. The pandemic made visiting my family very difficult - there were no flights for me to go there and my family still cannot come and visit me because the US embassy in Belarus does not provide tourist visas. 
Yesterday when I learned about the DOT proposal I was devastated and, to be honest, very frustrated. I understand the DOT’s concerns regarding the safety of passengers, however I do not see any positive effects the prohibition of flights to Belarus would have. The only effect it would have is making the travel to Belarus more expensive (and it is already very pricey as it is), longer and inconvenient for people like me who have family in Belarus. In case of emergency travel it would just make people lose precious time. It would have no effect on safety of the passengers whatsoever.  

In light of all the above, I urge you to please reconsider the proposal and keep in mind all the Belarus natives living in the US. I have a 4 year old son, I want him to know where he came from and to preserve his heritage. I want him to be able to go and see his grandmothers and grandfather. Please do not deprive him of that.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

My name is Debra Touchette, and I am an American teacher at QSI International School of Minsk. We are the only English-language international school in Minsk, and as such, we serve the families of US Embassy staff as well as the families of many of America’s allies, including Germany, Poland, the Republic of Korea, and many more. Living in Minsk has become more and more challenging over the last year due to COVID and the ongoing civil unrest, but working with my students and serving their families continues to be a rewarding and worthy endeavor. 

I am writing today to urge you to reconsider the proposed sanctions that would ban the purchase of airline tickets between Belarus and the US. As you know, the land borders are currently closed, so it is not possible to take a train or car to a neighboring country. Flights to and from EU nations have also been cancelled. The only way in and out of the country for someone without a diplomatic passport is to fly, and essentially the only way is from Minsk to Istanbul (as Russia requires visas that often take months to acquire) with connecting flights to the US. If you ban the sale of direct tickets, you will not be affecting Lukashenka or his regime in the slightest. Instead, you will be placing undue financial burdens on American citizens and families. We would need to buy the single tickets to Turkey, exit the transit area and retrieve our luggage, check in for flights again. We would need visas for Turkey, possibly hotel rooms, new covid tests if the layovers mean it’s longer than 72 hours to fly to the US. There is a potential for quarantine in Turkey. We would also have to pay baggage fees again, which, for a family returning to the US, means thousands of additional dollars in fees. 

I must reiterate — NONE of these burdens would affect Lukashenka or his regime IN THE SLIGHTEST. Not a single, tiny bit. Instead, you would be forcing American families to pay at least double to come home. This sanction would ONLY cause suffering to American citizens and families. As a teacher, I am there to serve the families of Americans and our allies. Belarusians are not allowed to attend the school past age 7. I know I would not be able to afford these additional financial burdens and would be forced to leave my job. The majority of employees at QSI are American. Forcing this financial burden on us, for a symbolic gesture, means we would all have to decide if serving American families is financially viable. I am not getting rich as a teacher. My salary is about $40,000 a year. If enough staff finds these burdens untenable, this could then force the school to close if it cannot maintain enough staff, which would then cause the families of Embassy staff and our allies to suffer because they do not have a school for their children. 

Again, you KNOW this sanction to be symbolic and will have NO effect on Lukashenka or anyone in his regime. Not one single effect. If passed, it will, however, have a devastating financial affect on American citizens who are in the country to serve other American citizens and American allies. I implore you, in the strongest possible measure, to find another way to send a message.

My husband, a naturalized US citizen born in Belarus, hasn't seen his family in Belarus in more than 7 years. His father recently passed away and my husband was unable to attend the funeral because of the pandemic. He is planning to travel to Belarus this September to see his mother and visit his father's grave and now he won't be able to. His mother is in her 80s and her health is failing so my husband can't postpone his travel any longer.
Another issue is unaccompanied minors currently visiting their extended families in Belarus during summer break. Will they be able to return to the US by the start of the school or will they be stranded in Belarus causing great stress to them and their parents in the US? I am very worried about my son Anthony, an US born US citizen.  He is now in Belarus. We bought his round trip tickets from the US to Belarus before . Could you please make sure this proposed rule does not apply to previously bought tickets. Please let my son safely return to the US.",,,,,,,

I fully understand your concerns, but I am convinced that this Order will not have any impact on the Belarusian political regime. It will cause a significant negative impact on ordinary Belarusian and U.S. citizens who wish to visit their families, come to study or work, implement scientific/business/cultural projects, etc. Personally, I am a Belarusian citizen. I have been selected to the Fulbright Foreign Student Program sponspored by the U.S. Department of State. The purpose of this Program is academic and cultural exchange. Prohibition of the sale of passenger air transportation will create significant difficulties in implementation of the Program.
Moreover, it is a well-know fact that a lot of talented immigrants enriched the U.S. and contributed to what the U.S. are today. This is particularly true about Belarusians: for example, a lot of Belarusian IT-specialists come to the U.S. and develop projects known worldwide (PandaDoc, Flo Health, etc.). I am happy that the U.S. encourage implementation of people's talents. Prohibition of flights will create difficulties for the most talented and ambitious people. They will have to arrive to another country and buy tickets there so that they do not violate the Order (which I hope will not be adopted!). I believe it is not reasonable to create difficulties to people with noble objectives, especially in today's COVID times. There are no direct flights between Belarus and U.S., therefore there are no grounds to think that the Belarusian authorities might cause harm to the U.S. in any manner. Sanctions should be aimed at people responsible for the current situation in Belarus and people considered a threat to international peace and security.
In light of the foregoing, I kindly ask you not to adopt the Order and support both the Belarusian and U.S. people.
Thank you.",,,,,,,

My name Sean and this July I am marrying an amazing women who is a naturalized U.S citizen originally from Belarus. Our wedding is to happen in Belarus and the only way we can get there is by plane due to overland travel restrictions. The proposed order “PROHIBITION OF THE SALE OF U.S.-BELARUS PASSENGER AIR TRANSPORTATION” (DOT-OST-2021-0074) would restrict us and other U.S. citizens, who desperately need to see their families after the coronavirus lockdown, from using the only viable method of traveling to Belarus. This order is aimed at harming Lukashenko’s regime, but the real damage is to the ordinary families of Belarus who will not be able to see their American relatives for an indeterminate amount of time. This order while rooted in the desire to help the people of Belarus fails in its mission. The free movement of people between Belarus and the United States can only help in our goal of spreading the ideals of a verdant democracy.

We appreciate the intent behind this order, and we support orders narrowly targeting the Lukashenko regime. Please don’t punish normal Belarusians and normal U.S. citizens, reject or significantly modify the proposed order “PROHIBITION OF THE SALE OF U.S.-BELARUS PASSENGER AIR TRANSPORTATION”. A significant modification could be one which targets a travel ban only on members of the Belarus government or a ban on flying over Belarus for all flights originating from the U.S. but still allows for flights to Belarus.

Respectfully,

Sean",,,,,,,

1. Belarus is not a tourist destination, so this measure is hitting mostly US citizens with strong family ties to Belarus. Now flying one way to Belarus from US West coast takes at least 20-20 hours and 3-4 connected flights. This measure will require US citizens who NEED to go to Belarus (and this is majority) to buy different tickets (with possible need to stay in third country and having separate tickets lost in case of delay), thus rendering their travel miserable. This is what this measure is targeting: making travel for US citizens to their families miserable.
2. This measure does not do anything to the current Belarus regime: involved Belarus officials are already under sanctions and do not travel to Europe, not to mention USA.
I urge Department of Transportation not to put the proposed measure into effect.",,,,,,,

Please DO NOT PASS Docket (DOT-OST-2021-0074) 

The proposed regulation will hurt specifically US and Belarusian citizens and residents visiting Belarus to support their elderly family members or those that serves other American citizens and American allies in Belarus. 

I was born in Belarus and I am a legal resident in USA,  most of my family lives in Belarus. Due to covid pandemic, I was not able to see my parents for a long time.  There were no flights for me to go there and my family cannot visit since US embassy stopped issuing tourist visas during the pandemics. My parents are old, my 3 year old girl constantly asks to see them in person, my mom cries cause she cannot hug her granddaughter and has to play peek-a-boo with her over the video conferencing. With the lockdown last year, all we have was a pray that our loved ones will be fine and hope that we can fly and meet and hug each other once vaccination is available. And now, when we can do that, when you can hug and meet with your family, you are STEALING this right from families like ours.  NONE of these burdens would affect Lukashenka or his regime.  It would be US tax-payers who would pay extra money for transfers, for extra visas, who will loose several days for a travel, leaving just a fraction of a small vacation time with our loved ones. And yes, that will increase our risk to get sick with covid. In addition, in case of emergency ( and with covid pandemic this is a constant begging in a head not to be in such situation), we will loose a precious time. Put our shoes on before making a decision since this document would not affect regime at all!

I urge you to reconsider and find another way to send a message.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Irina Astrovskaya, PhD

In the mid-1990s, President Bill Clinton and the US Congress funded the Freedom Support Act, which let students from the former Soviet Union spend a year of study in the US, all expenses paid. It was highly competitive. But it ensured that there were bright young people with first-hand experience of the US democracy. Some ended up in positions of power in politics and business and made, or are making, their little bit of a difference. It was a brilliant investment: connections between regular citizens should be supported.

And these connections help me and people like me do our little tiny bits to foster Belarusian civil society when it is under attack from the regime. Please don’t make it so much more difficult for us. 

In short: connections and civil society should be supported. The regulation would punish Belarusian-Americans and disrupt the essential interpersonal work that we are doing. ",,,,,,,

How would you feel if we will cancel any travel within USA states and can’t see your family. Stop thinking about your needs as politicians and start thinking about people. You are only creating anger and hurt between nations. Why would you make people suffer for no reason. Leave your political views away from ordinary people who currently respect this nation. Don’t create discrimination in this country, because this decision is about discrimination of Belarusian people who live in USA. Don’t make this to go through.",,,,,,,

As an American citizen with roots (as well parents and other family members) in Belarus, I urge you not to enact the proposed regulation, as it will only hurt regular citizens, especially those with families on both countries and will cut off and separate family members, but will not have any effect on the Lukashenko's regime that this proposed regulation is supposed to target. In my personal case, travel regulations already imposed by European Union made it nearly impossible for me to travel to see my dying grandmother for the last time, and if this regulation is enacted, I will be unable to travel to Belarus even making a very difficult journey through a very limited amount of other countries (such as Russia or Turkey) that allow transfer. Thousands of Americans have family in Belarus and cutting off the connection only hurts them, their families, cuts off mail deliveries, but does not hurt the regime and only plays along the regime's ambition - to isolate Belarus and it's citizens from pro-Democracy countries and to show people in Belarus that the world does not care about their suffering.

When it comes to the proposal to stop selling tickets I do not support it and see several major concerns:
1) The action is not targeted. 
- Hard to imagine that Lukashenko's team is flying to/from the US these days... Ordinary Belarusians who fight against the regime will be the affected instead. Those people fly to see their family, which is a basic human right. It is anti-democratic to prohibit this.
 - The proposal does not help protect US airlines and US airline workers as none fly to Belarus.
2) The strategic value is unclear.
- Country's isolation will only worsen the situation with democratic rights in Belarus.
- It will be more difficult for international experts to travel to consult and assist in negotiations for political crisis remediation.

Help is still needed to increase pressure on Lukaskenko's regime and his supporters from other countries (e.g Russia) - swift and targeted measured are required.

This proposal will not harm Aliaksandr Lukashenka. It will harm the Belarusian people. Lukashenka stays in power through force and support from Russia. This proposal will not paint Western countries in a good light; however it may help Russia paint Western democracies as places that are uncaring to eastern Europe. 

I speak as an American citizen married to a Belarusian who has already not been able to see his family in over 5 years. If this proposal were to go through, it would become nearly impossible for people like us with family in Belarus to reach family members if there were a health or other emergency.

I assume the goal of this proposal is to place pressure on Aliaksandr Lukashenka. However, it will backfire. Instead, it will harm those who most need help – the people who have been oppressed by Lukashenka for almost thirty years. Instead of banning travel, we should take positions that increase support for the Belarusian people.

Ask yourselves... ""Self, who does this actually hurt?""  Do you think it will give Lukashenka pause because he has to re-check his bags and book his tickets to the US on two separate itineraries?  You think THIS will make him think about retiring from power?? Seriously??  COME ON!!!! 

""Americans want to book a flight to Iran and other countries with outward hostilities toward the United States? Absolutely?  Americans want to travel to Belaurs who poses no threat to the United States? ABSOLUTELY NOT!""  How much sense does this make??????

The real numbers of infected and dead are concealed, and the current vaccination rate is below 6% of the entire population. Beyond simply ignoring the pandemic, COVID has been actively used as a biological weapon and the means of torture against the dictator's political opponents, by intentionally crowded prisons with such ""dissidents"" with the goal of increasing infection rates in geometric proportion.

1. It is in direct violation of rights and liberties protected by the U.S. Constitution, as well as numerous other laws, rules, statutes and regulations, including international ones.
2. Article 1 of the Chicago Convention provides that a state has “complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory”. When overflying a state’s national airspace, therefore, civil aircrafts are subject to the full jurisdiction of that state and can be intercepted and ordered to land at the indicated airport. Examples: a Bolivian plane was forced to land in Austria in 2013 because the U.S. thought that E. Snowden was on board. In 2016, a Belarus jetliner was ordered to land in Ukraine. As such, Belarusian president did NOT brake any laws. 
3. Indeed, there is no evidence whatsoever that Lukashenko broke any laws. Nonsense statements and baseless allegations by some government officials are NOT evidence. In fact, ICAO refused to conduct an investigation. 
Accordingly, to avoid unnecessary Court’s intervention, said proposed Order must be declined and denied in its entirety. ",,,,,,,

The US must take concrete action to stand up against the Lukashenko regime and promote American values - limiting travel and freedom of movement is not a core american value. The Lukashenko regime is limiting the ability for Belarusian citizens to leave Belarus, while the US is proposing to do the same in the name of protecting its citizens. This narrative is a slide towards authoritarianism not a defense of human rights nor a display of solidarity with the Belarusian people. When in history has the US banned travel to another country as a measure of national security? Only under the Trump Administration and in the 1920s to limit Italian and Chinese immigrants - do the Belarusian people deserve the same treatment, we should stand up as allies to the people of Belarus not turn our backs on them, we have now eliminated the best option for the people of Belarus to escape desolation and torture. 

The unintended consequences of this measure are not being fully considered. This Order is a knee jerk reaction, with minimal analysis or foresight into bringing about the end of the Lukashenko regime - did we ban flights to Iran or Russia after they downed an aircraft, killing hundreds of people? 

I am an American citizen, with a family history of service and sacrifice in WWII, Korean War and Vietnam, this act is a defiance of the values so many Americans fought to uphold, freedom, liberty, pursuit of justice - and should be discontinued immediately.

Being both US and Belarusian citizen and having family there that will negatively impact my ability to see family and friends, but I believe this is in mutual interests of American and Belarusian nations and can prevent lots of risks associated with visiting Belarus. Also it will show continuous and streamlined political position of US towards regime in Belarus. One of the impacts that will be prevented - thousands of travelers will not spend money in Belarus, so there will be couple millions dollars less cashflow this year for Lukashenko to use. Combined with widening sanctions it adds up to impact on economy and on the ability of the regime to support itself.
I urge you to implement this rule as beneficial for both nations, despite of many comments advising to do differently.

1. It is in direct violation or rights and liberties protected by the U.S. Constitution, as well as numerous other laws, rules, statutes, regulations, including international ones. 
2. Article 1 of the Chicago Convention provides that a state has “complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory”. When overflying a state’s national airspace, therefore, civil aircrafts are subject to the full jurisdiction of that state and can be intercepted and ordered to land at the indicated airport. Examples: a Bolivian plane was forced to land in Austria in 2013 because U.S. thought that E. Snowden was on board. In 2016, a Belarus jetliner was ordered to land in Ukraine. 
3. Indeed, there is no evidence whatsoever that Belarusian president broke any laws. Conclusory statements and baseless allegations by some government officials are NOT evidence. In fact, ICAO refused to conduct an inverstigation. As such, no laws were broken by Lukashenko, and there is NO evidence to prove otherwise. 
Accordingly, to avoid unnecessary Court’s intervention, said proposed Order must be declined and denied in its entirety! ",,,,,,,

This measure won’t discourage the human rights abuses in Belarus, instead, it will contribute even more to isolating Belarus and making matters worse for the regular people living in the US with ties to Belarus. 

The Lukashenko regime is limiting the ability of Belarusian citizens to leave Belarus, while the US is proposing to do the same in the name of protecting its citizens. This narrative is a slide towards authoritarianism not a defense of human rights nor a display of solidarity with the Belarusian people. 

Limiting travel & freedom of movement is NOT the answer. 

I am a permanent US resident (originally from Belarus). I tear up thinking of having to make the phone call to my elderly parents, informing them they won’t see me any time soon, due to the new law that is supposed to “protect” me. So now I shall be well-protected without a chance to see my family, how ironic.

Please reconsider & DO NOT PASS. Thank you for your time :)",,,,,,,

The proposed regulation will only hurt ordinary US and Belarusian citizens and will not have any effect on the Belarusian government.

The following is to address a statement by Air Line Pilots Association (ALMA) that was posted in support of this docket:
The letter by ALPA states that they ""strongly support prohibition of the sale of air passenger transportation, including interline tickets, between the United States and Belarus"" due to safety concerns. Their statement, however, lacks any logical explanation for how prohibition of flight tickets sales for existing flights will help to achieve safety or ""apologetic resolution by Belarus"". Airlines that have chosen to continue their flights to/from Belarus are within their right to do so based on their risk assessment whether you like or not. The only purpose this DOT rule will achieve is prohibit ordinary people from buying interline tickets for those flights thus placing additional burden on thousands of passengers (especially elderly and those with kids) who will now have to jump through hoops to visit their immediate family members.

ALPA statement is signed by representatives of Alaska, American, Atlas Air, Delta, Hawaiian, Jet Blue, Polar, Southwest, Spirit, United. None of these airlines has ever operated flights to/from Belarus, and none of US passenger carriers has ever operated such flights. Decisions regarding flights to/from Belarus should be left with those companies who actually fly there, such as Lufthansa, KLM, Air France, Austrian Airlines, LOT, Turkish, Aeroflot and their respective transportation authorities. If those airlines decide not to operate flights to/from Belarus, it's their decision and we, passengers, will have to agree to that. However, if some of them decide to operate their flights to/from Belarus, based on what legal grounds an ordinary person should be prohibited from buying an interline ticket for an existing flight? How exactly does this sale prohibition increase safety and ""send a strong message to the Lukashenko's regime""? How is it a sanction on the Belarusian government, if Jane Doe used to fly ""USA - third country"" and then ""third country - Belarus"" on a interline ticket, and now she is prohibited from buying such ticket and needs to buy separate tickets? Where is logic?

Additionally, the fact that ALPA statement is signed by UPS and Fedex is mind-boggling. So UPS and Fedex support prohibition of air passenger sales to/from Belarus due to safety concerns and the necessity to ""send a strong message"". At the same time they continue to fly their aircraft in Belarusian airspace to cut down on flight time and minimize flight expenses/maximize profits. So it's safe for their aircraft and pilots and ""strong message"" is no longer needed, right? Pure hypocrisy.

The State Department and DOT should ""send a strong message"" to the Belarusian Government by targeting those directly responsible for the Ryanair flight diversion. All their information is widely available. Do not place burden on ordinary people instead.",,,,,,,

This rule, while intended to punish the regime of Alexandr Lukeshenko, will have little impact on him and the political situation inside Belarus, and a huge impact on the small community of Belarusians and their families living in the US.  

While I understand that the intention is to punish and isolate Belarus' current political regime, I find it hard to believe that preventing the small community in the United States who travel to Belarus (most of whom already oppose the current president and have overwhelmingly voted against him) moves the needle on the current situation or puts any meaningful pressure to make changes and amends at a national level.  In doing this, making Belarus a pariah state akin to North Korea or Cuba, will only harden the relations further.  I have always been of the opinion that the best diplomats of the United States do not necessarily work at the State Department, but are average citizens.  These everyday travelers show what real Americans are and illustrate our society and what our lives are truly like.  In removing these individuals, travelers, and families, the United States is actually harming its foreign policy initiatives by preventing these one on one interactions to happen.

Allow me to also illustrate how this will affect me and my family on a personal level.  Since 2005, my wife, children, and I have been traveling annually to Belarus to visit parents, extended family and friends.  This is the only opportunity for us to visit with these people as they are either physically unable to travel internationally or further regulations have made it practically impossible for the average citizen of Belarus to obtain a travel visa to the United States.  With the removal of our ability to purchase tickets and travel to Belarus, this proposal will render half our family completely inaccessible.  This will prevent my young children (ages 10 and 3) from seeing their grandfather (who is currently 88 and unable to travel due to health concerns).  This will prevent them from giving him a hug, having him read them a bedtime story, or show them the world through his eyes.  They will be unable to see, play, and learn with and from a myriad of cousins, aunts, uncles, friends.  This will sunder them from their godparents.  They will have the country that makes up half their cultural identity unavailable to them.  How am I to explain to small children why they can no longer see half their family?  How do I explain to them that the government of the country they call home refuses to allow them to travel freely?  

As previously stated, please think of whom this regulation actually harms.  Alexandr Lukashenko and his political allies in Belarus are already unable to travel, have had their international accounts frozen, and have had nationalized industries sanctioned.  They have shown time and time again no concern as to what sanctions or restrictions are placed on them.   If mammoth sanctions have not moved the needle in 20+ years of various implementations, this seemingly small one is beneath their notice.  It does not harm them, it harms us, the community with family ties.  I implore the Department not to implement this rule change.  

Thank you

It will also reduce their exposure to Western democratic ideas.  And it may boost Lukashenko's willingness to crack down on protestors and dissidents.

As a change in the Belarus government is absolutely needed and corresponding decision makers must be held accountable for the grounding of the plane, a blanket policy such as this one impacts people who have nothing to do with the incident.
What are the goals of this decision? If a person has to fly to Belarus, the plane will land there anyway. Additionally, there are still other flight companies in Europe and it will be just more expensive but still possible to get to Belarus.
I have my mother still living in the country. With COVID and in general, I need to have a quick way to travel there in case of an emergency. This policy will impact me and others who live in the US directly, while the the government of Belarus will continue on their course.
I am certain there are other more targeted ways to address the issue. I hope you will reconsider this decision.

By preventing people to come to Belarus, DOT will  play into the hands of illegitimate Belorussian authorities by further isolating Belarusian people. It's the Belarusian government that needs to be isolated, not the people who oppose it.
       Also, thousands of American citizens and Lawful Permanent residents have their roots in Belarus and travel there on the regular basis, mainly to visit their elderly relatives. The provision DOT-OST-2021-0074 will impede their ability to do so.
        Finally, the provision DOT-OST-2021-0074 will also  make even  more difficult  for the  people who oppose the current illegitimate regime  to escape the country.

This change would be in alignment with several of the stated purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act as presented in 44 USC 3501, in particular those elements seeking to reduce the time and cost burden imposed on both the public and the agency, and those encouraging performance-oriented use of agency IT resources, including subsections 1-3, 5 and 10.

Mr. Todd Holman
Director, Office of Aviation Analysis
United States Department of Transportation
1200 New Jersey Avenue SE
Washington, DC 20590

Dear Mr. Holman,

The Hillsborough County Aviation Authority (HCAA), operator of Tampa International Airport (TPA), appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Department of Transportation Docket No. DOT-OST-2021-0103 regarding Reassignment of Schedules at Newark-Liberty International Airport. Newark-Liberty is a critically important airport which serves the New York City metropolitan area - TPA’s single largest passenger market. Per DOT T-100 data, in the last full year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (2019) the Tampa-New York (EWR/JFK/LGA) market generated 1,902,719 passengers in both directions, or an impressive 2,606 passengers daily each way (PDEW). Despite the impact of COVID-19 on air travel, TPA maintains a current schedule of 219 departures to Newark-Liberty for September 2021. TPA currently enjoys scheduled passenger service from four carriers to Newark-Liberty; this month United will offer 121 total departures, JetBlue 66 departures, Frontier 29 departures and Spirit with 3 departures.

TPA believes it could benefit from the additional capacity and bolstered competition that would result from the granting of 16 peak-hour runway timings to a single Low Cost (LCC) or Ultra Low Cost carrier (ULCC). Broadening the level of competition within Tampa’s largest Origin & Destination (O&D) market would likely result in lower fares, stimulating traffic levels and allowing for greater recovery of passenger service to the Tampa Bay region. HCAA strongly supports the DOT’s intention to grant a single LCC or ULCC carrier 16 peak-hour runway timings at Newark-Liberty International Airport, a decision that honors the original purpose of the 2010 Southwest decision to provide critical mass enabling higher competition and public benefit. Thank you.

Best Regards,

Joe Lopano

The ports have instituted an appointment requirement at all ocean container terminals. Once container is empty at the customer you must first find a terminal that will accept the empty container based on the size, ocean carrier and chassis type. All of these categories must be on the web site listed as open for receiving. Then you must check to see if there are any restrictions such as day or night shift receiving only and dual transaction required meaning you must be picking up a loaded container from that terminal before you can drop the empty. Then if you can meet all of the requirements you must check to see if an appointment is available at the terminal to return that empty, if none are available then you must take empty container to your truck yard where it sits until you can make an appointment. If unable to return in timely manner you must the pay the ocean carrier per diem ranging from $130.00 to $325,00 for dry goods containers. If you can convince the ocean carrier to waive the per diem bill due to lack of ability to return empty, you must still pay the chassis leasing companies $25.00 to $35.00 per day each and every day you have the chassis out as they do not waive fees due to inability to return empty container. If the appointment for empty return system went away thousands more empty container could be returned every day. Additionally the restrictions in place at the terminals should not be allowed. Rule should be any container out gating from a terminal should be allowed back to that terminal on any shift without restrictions or appointments.",,,,,,,

The Department of Transportation should look into the business model of Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) presently practiced by several leading railroads.  A good starting point for PSR can be found in Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_railroading (viewed September 16, 2021).  From the article:

""Precision railroading has been criticized on many fronts. Shippers complain about poorer service and confusion during the transition. Railroad workers have raised concerns about safety due to reduced inspections and staffing.[2] Under PSR, service is typically eliminated on shipping lanes and origin-destination pairs that have low traffic levels. Intermodal terminals have been consolidated, with the railroad relying on trucks for the last hundred miles.[3] Fewer workers are needed, even with higher traffic volumes. [4] As a result, over 20,000 railroad workers have been laid off in 2019.[5] PSR advocates claim that shippers benefit in the long run from reduced costs and more reliable schedules. More consistent scheduling may also facilitate illegal freight hopping. However, PSR has been criticized as being an agenda pushed to appeal to investors and increase stock prices and dividends in the short term at the expense of long term capacities. [6] [7]""

2. Give us some DOT only rest areas.
The DOT mandates meal and 10-hour rest breaks without providing an adequate amount of areas to comply. Drivers often have to end their work day early simply because they fear they will be unable to find a place to park.
The DOT should build a sufficient number of truck-only parking areas, and stop relying on private trucks stop for driver compliance.

When carriers exceed this safety rating carriers will operate at a reduced HOS of 14 hr rule 10hr sleeper birth.  Additionally trucking schools should no longer be for profit.  Trucking schools should be in a community college under a 2 year associates degree where potential drivers can be regulated in learning to read write speak English a long with basic math and US geography.  Local trucking companies could sponsor these programs for the local driving portions of the curriculum for local delivery of freight at a substantially lower cost while giving students experience hands on training with an experienced instructor of course.  This way all drivers are taught to actually taught how to drive through a program that can be nationally monitored and controlled yet still be a benefit to local companies who participate in funding.  Implement trucking demmurage decree.  Steep penalties for delaying truckers at the dock across the country at shippers and consignees.  Make use of the new technology of driverless trucks.  Make linehaul lanes across designated interstates where the freight can be dropped and hooked on one end of a state electronically transported to a drop and hook area on opposite side of the state to drop and hook again for a rebound load.  This would ease the burden on the industry for the need of as many drivers and the cost of driver pay to carriers while transporting freight nonstop across states all over the country.

The pay across the industry involving intrastate truck drivers are affecting the retention rate of the growing old workforce force of those drivers. Another compounding factor is the types of trailers that transport those goods depending on the location of pick up and drop off. For example, ports have concrete constraints with how many trucks can load with the intermodals to move the freight (not including the amount of time it takes to move those containers off the ships to the truck. There should be an immediate wage floor to increase the labor force transitioning into supply chain. Most important industry in our country, because if goods arent moving and being consolidated in the united states then our GDP, inflation, globalization, and..... so on are heavily affected.

2.) Ports have too many rules on container movements at the port especially with the empty containers. The amount of empty containers as compared to not empty will be mind blowing especially with the sea shipping surge for PPE in the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic during Q2 & Q3.

3.) The education of supply chain - training for CDL-A should be immediately allocated to nearly 75% of community colleges in the united states to receive the proper education regarding tractor trailer driving, safety, and etc. Combine this with the necessary skills regarding mathematics, literacy, and communication is the utmost importance.

I have observed first hand the decline of this industry over the years. The Railroad's main goal is to maximize profits and our supply chain is suffering because of greed. The Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) model most of the Railroads have adopted in the U.S. is a major cause of delays on the railroads. Maximizing profits by reducing crews, closing railyards and service facilities is good for profits but you cannot move trains without people and working equipment. Stock buy backs do not help the infrastructure of a railroad but make investors richer. The railroads have benefited from deregulation from the 1980 Staggers Act. and this has led to loss of railroad jobs, the decline of safety. Our supply chain is hurting because large corporations have free reign to do whatever they want. It is time to reel in these large  railroad corporations by reregulating them. This should be a priority to insure our supply chain runs smoothly. The Railroads have shown over and over that record profits mean more to them than our supply chain.

CSX has implemented Precision Scheduled Railroading, which basically combines 2 to 3 trains into one, while significantly reducing its workforce in order to reduce operating ratios to impress Wall Street.  THIS IS MAKING SHAREHOLDERS INFLUENCE THE LOGISTICS OF RAILROADING WHILE FAILING IN THE FUNDAMENTALS OF RAILROADING!  It is motivated from Greed.  Here in southeastern NC, a intermodal train from Charlotte, is combined with a wood pellet train ( for Great Britain) which is combined with regular freight for the port of NC!  Currently at our NC port, an overload of shipping containers sits IDEAL, relying mainly on trucks, to be shipped out of the port.  Before precision railroading began, this supply disruption never existed.  As a railroader, I believe many of the supply shortages currently happening are because our railroads laid off tens of thousands railroad employees back in 2018/2019 to accomplish this disaster of methodology.  I invite you to see for yourself the incredible scenery of containers at the NC port!  This is just one example of many!  There are also instances were CSX is pulling up rail, SCRAPING RAIL, to produce revenue because precision railroading does not work!  In Hamlet NC AN ENTIRE HUMP YARD HAS BEEN REMOVED, an effective way of switching rail cars has been eliminated!  Now these trains, 2/3 trains in one, have to stressfully back into what is left of Hamlet Yard!  Just last week, 10 trains were waiting to enter Hamlet Yard!  Hamlet Yard is a railroad terminal where 5 rail lines meet, where cars are supposed to be switched effectively and rerouted out of one the remaining rail lines.  CSX has removed half the rail of this very vital rail yard!  Just several weeks ago, one train sat 4 days waiting to enter the yard!  Besides having missing removed rail, which has no plans on being replaced, the railroad has THE BARE MINIMUM IN MANPOWER TO MOVE OUR NATION’S FREIGHT.  More times than not, this railroad struggles to find people to move these trains.  Since laying off so many railroaders, the railroad blames the loss of manpower on attendance issues!  You can imagine how efficient a workforce can be with bare minimal manpower working 2/3 trains in one train!  These trains are at times, 2 1/2 miles long!  Oversized for rail yards which were developed in the middle of the last century.  Many of these trains are oversized for rail sidings.  It creates a logistical nightmare trying to orchestrate all these rail cars through the rail system!  Which is part of the precision railroading design, keeping cars out of rail yards!  All Wall Street cares about, ARE THE RAIL CARS MOVING!  So it is quite common for a rail customer’s freight cars to be bypassed their industry because their cars were not switched properly and effectively in a rail yard!  Precision Railroading is a disaster, and it’s reputation has made its way throughout social media, CAUSING NO ONE INTEREST IN ACQUIRING A RAILROAD JOB.  All you need to do, is find one of these railroad’s recruiting videos on YouTube and read the comments!  Our nation is never going to prosper with our railroads in this current shape.  ",,,,,,,

Management has cut labor so far to save on profits and get operational costs down they have now a lack of workers to actually move the freight effectively. The railroads and most businesses have moved from providing actual good service and pride in moving g American freight to more worried about raising shares to increase profits.  Equipment is old and wore out in which the Management says it is rated for this many tons it will be fine but being worn out and not maintaining such Equipment it doesn't work as is should . Longer and heavier trains are caused g issues with more equipment failures due to railroads notbeing designed for 13000 foot trains .. when you have 14000 for tartan on single main and sidings to meet and pass are only 8000 feet one train has to wait for the other longer. Lack of labor has caused the employees that are left to be over worked with less rest which I. Turn causes fatigue and moral to decline. The lack of a current contract has also declined moral which in turn declines swift moving of freight . The power of the Government to force rail to work without a contract takes the power away from the employee and gives too much to the carriers .  The lack of the employers not following the contract is also a moral issue and which causes labor to decline due to moral. These are things we as employees of the transportation industry see that doesn't seem to want to be dressed .  Good luck with fixing these issues . And God speed bless this great country ",,,,,,,

Cutting costs so deeply with this RSP model of railroading is causing alot of issues in the transportation industry.  Cutting the conductors off of the train is only going to cause alot more headaches and slow downs across the networks. In the event of a emergency, it might take hours for someone to show up. Having a conductor on the train would help first responders arriving at the scene. These railroads always love to state they have new technology such as PTC.  PTC is a safety computer tool, not a replacement for a conductor.  The computer can't walk back and preform work on the train when something goes wrong.  Also, nobody ever wants to talk about the event of a possible cyber attack(s) on these internet based train control systems. If these systems failed or happened to be hacked, things would get real ugly really quick.  Thus is why it is even more important to have two people in the locomotive cab, conductor and engineer, workings together to keep things moving safely.  Thank you kindly for your time.

If there is an emergency where someone might need to cross, the railroad does not care and often instructs crews to not cut crossings. And now the railroads are pushing for one man crews, which would delay freight even more, due to when a train has a problem or separation there will be no one to walk back and fix the trains, and no one to cut crossings in an emergency.

This is a war on humanity and has impacted our nation and the whole entire world on a multi-faceted level that has wreaked devastation all across the charts. The VAERS reporting site is only reporting about 1% of all adverse reactions in deaths. If it were to be accurate, millions of people have been impacted or died from taking this viral weapon shot. This is going to affect everything in our nation and all the nations combined in the world. It's going to cause a domino effect. Key players in places such as nuclear power plants and dams, electricity, cyber attacks, the internet, air travel, and it keeps on going and going with this list, are going to come to a halt, a crippling halt, as limited amount of people have the know-how to control these devices and things to keep them going without them being shut down, or even worse, causing meltdowns and floods, which will lead to devastation of all kinds.

We need to put an emergency halt on this mRNA gene therapy that they are calling a vaccination, and we need to look at it as an attack by the globalist and elite trying to manipulate and take over the world.

I've been driving for almost 20 years and have been in the transportation industry for almost 30 years, and I've never seen anything somewhat close to this devastation, yet it is getting worse on a daily basis.

People are waiting several months for parts to come in. People are getting sick from the vaccination. This needs to stop immediately and an investigation needs to be conducted both outside our country and within on who is a part of this Nuremberg code breaking criminal activity!",,,,,,,

Many wharehouse have very slow procedures that often delay drivers for hours, in many instances, the drivers aren't getting paid detention. It also may cause a driver to be late for his it her next appointment. At the same time trucking companies and drivers sometimes have to pay to have freight unloaded. I believe businesses should unload and load their own freight and pay detention costs. Next, construction is another problem. I recently went to Tucker, Ga. On I-85 south in South Carolina, just south of Charlotte, N.C., that is the absolute WORST, MOST DANGEROUS construction zone I have ever been thru. It is ten miles of terror! People have gotten killed there. The medical examiner that came to the last tragic accident, called it a ""death trap!"" I agree with him. The infrastructure needs repair badly, but during repairs, construction zones need to be safe, and passable, making travel less likely to cause delays. I would also like to suggest that the current 14 hour rule be eliminated for over-the-road drivers. As I have described earlier, delivering to or picking up from customers can take hours! Meanwhile, the 14 hour clock is ticking. Sometimes, that can cause a driver to not have the hours to leave that customer. Many locations, like WalMart wharehouse do not allow drivers to park after a delivery has been made. I also would suggest that the ELD mandate be revoked. Many drivers have had problems with electronic log devices and the ELD mandate has NOT made trucking safer. It has been quite the opposite! Trucking accidents are at an industry high right now. Paper logs gave drivers a quarter hour of leeway from trip planning and unexpected delays. Now, truck parking is scarce. I was disappointed that Congress did not address truck parking. I would suggest that weight stations that have the technology for Prepass, use it, at all times. Many times I have come to scales and the facility doesn't have it on, causing a long line at weight stations. More delay. I have always felt like trucking is one of the MOST important industries essential to this country's economy and at the same time one of the most under appreciated, unfairly legislative, and taken for granted industries in the United States. I remember all if the live and appreciation expressed for truckers during the first waive of the Covid pandemic, but ohhhh as soon as the pandemic restrictions ended, the love went away and the bad legislation started. Like, the State of Connecticut, imposing a truck only till on trucks! Then, there are several proposals in House Bills mandating BAD legislation for trucks, especially small business truck owners. Some parts were taking out, while others are pending inside of the infrastructure bill. The United States Government had got to do a better job of protecting the trucking industry. If we all stopped, the economy would come to a halt! Everything that we all use in our daily lives, either the final product or the ingredients for that product, has been moved by truck! Think about that. Help us do our jobs better. ",,,,,,,

A few to start are: 1. HOS exemption for safe million milers and/or 8 year safe drivers, if your not racing all the clocks your a much safer driver and would work safer to get or keep that exemption. 2.  Change the headlight laws to keep people headlights on longer during low light situations.  Popular vehicle colors blend into pavement colors making them difficult to see during inclement weather conditions and be adamant about writing offenders up for the infraction. 3.  The use of warning lights on all stoplights above 35mph and all railroad crossing above 35mph.   The timing of these lights and crossings puts a large truck in a dangerous situation when it takes us 6 seconds to stop from highway speeds but lights and crossings start flashing or yellow lights last 3 seconds before red.   Also the timing of all this lights is horrendous throughout this country costing tremendous amounts of fuel and wear on our vehicles.   This is just a fraction of the list I have to help out this industry.   A reduction of just 10% in deaths and accidents involving large trucks would save trucking 6 billion dollars a year.  That doesn’t include the fuel and wear and tear on our vehicles.   Hope to hear from you.   ",,,,,,,

Law enforcement does not enforce traffic laws and peoples driving is becoming increasingly dangerous especially in work zones, this by itself is a large cause of freight delays as there  are a ridiculously large number of speed related crashes. 
Another area of concern is the lack of parking for trucks, especially east of the Mississippi. Truck stops are full by noon-1400 and everyone else is left to park wherever they can, off ramps, retail parking lots etc. Barbara Walters and 20/20 should be sued for the false portrayal they did of truck drivers prompting municipalities to keep truck parking out of their areas. Tiny Gilman Wisconsin has a cheese factory that is its life blood, they had a problem with trucks parking on residential streets so rather than ban trucks they utilized some property downtown that had been abandoned, graveled the lot and put up signs directing trucks to the parking area. It’s a stones throw from local businesses and far enough away from houses so as not to disturb them, other municipalities should be forced to follow their example, you want businesses in your town and the jobs and tax revenue they generate then you should be forced to accommodate the trucks necessary to supply those businesses. People’s livelihoods depend on trucks, raw materials are hauled into manufacturing facilities and finished goods are taken to market, anyone who works in the retail or manufacturing sectors in this country only receives a paycheck because of trucks, the construction industry is equally dependent on trucks, every effort should be made to accommodate their needs, instead the public treats them like a blight on society. Don’t bite the hand that feeds you. 
Next our infrastructure has not kept up with the growth in population. I’ll use Chicago as an example, they run several interstates around the south side, if something were to happen to the bridge over the line pits on 80/90/94 it would cripple this country. The majority of the freight moving through the greater Chicago are is just that, moving through. There should have been a bypass built generations ago to keep all that freight out of the metroplex. Hell relieving that congestion would probably have a huge affect on carbon reduction. Instead you have stopped traffic idling and burning fuel all day and most of the night. I believe if money were spent on infrastructure that would reduce the congestion around cities we could greatly reduce carbon emissions. You’d probably have to consider trucks only bypass systems in some areas. 
Incentive needs to be provided for car pooling and public transportation usage. Car pool lanes don’t reduce congestion as the traffic is jammed up in those areas and the carpool lanes are virtually empty. 
Also you need to tax people for living far from work, there are people around cities living 50-60 miles from work and they are a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions and accidents as those are the people flying to and from work. Germany issues tickets based on a percentage of your income, to most of those people out in the suburbs the price of a ticket means nothing to them, make it mean something. 
Enforce speed laws, traffic flows much more smoothly when everyone is traveling at the same speed. Common sense should tell people that. 
Thank you for your time.",,,,,,,

Their own schedule of time. (2nd)Then for Safety reasons make anything over a hour a payable event. For loading and unloading. Then you can FIX the imaginary driver shortage (3rd) By requiring the same planned training period for those 18 up to all  new entry drivers.Most are put out on their own without enough knowledge of the Interstate and US roads systems so they get STRESSED right out the door.

Everything was running smoothly before the Covid authoritarianism started. The government created the shortages.
2. Expand public truck parking we both promote driver safety and allow the driver to maximize driving hours available on a daily basis. Take the money for this from the railroad grants;
The railroads are private companies, the tracks not useable by the public. Conversely, truckers are singlehandedly financing our roads and other projects. 
3. Limit fines, tolls, and civil settlements against truckers to what would be appropriate for other vehicles in the same scenario. In addition to being taxed disproportionately, we are subjected to usury at every turn. The sports as many drivers to leave the industry for financial hardship.
4. Require medical facilities to provide truck parking. As it stands, any driver that gets sick is forced to drive while ill by default until the trip is completed and the driver is able to get home.
5. Require shippers and receivers to provide truck parking with sanitary facilities, as detention often forces a driver into violation and unsafe driving.

Drivers and owner operators have grown tired of the no win situation. We get slapped at the shipper, at the receiver and by the broker. Shippers are not held to an industry standard on wait time. Brokers are all about kissing the shippers ass and throwing the carrier under the bus. It's unfair. Receivers are worse because they make you jump thru hoops because they know you just driven for at least a day and can't afford to lose the load due to it being refused because they don't like your attitude, even though they have one themselves and will provoke you. Brokers won't charge enough and take it from the carrier when they can't cover their bets. I'm personally am sick and tired of not being able to concentrate of my driving because I'm always worried about scale houses or state troopers fucking with me and looking for a reason to justify their existence at my expense. We get treated with contempt by the driving public, Our lives are endangered daily by hostile road raging idiots. We're held to a level of responsibility the average person can't fathom. We battle every day just to try to make an honest paycheck and it seems we are at war with everyone around us, not by our choosing.
We sacrifice a normal life so that everyone can live in security and comfort and we get fuck. No respect, no benefits, no retirement. Half of everything we make goes back out on fuel and insurance, and the chickenshit cops fuck us in ways that threaten our existence. Our job is more dangerous than theirs, but they have full reign to stop us and throw a monkey wrench in our gears, even though we do what we can to follow their rules. So I ask you, why should we be concerned about the fucking supply chain? Everyone in the game is trying to fuck us, but you want us to smile and say thank you. Fuck the supply chain! I haul when I want to and when it's profitable to me. Otherwise, the customer shit can rot on the docks and the state highway revenue generators can steal someone else's money, pride, and self respect. ",,,,,,,

Then, the next day, you are all ready there and waiting 3, or 4 hours past your new appointment time, and still not getting loaded.

Do to various issues, from covid safety to the continuing payment of unemployment benefits [which is incredibly unfair (since fairness seems so important to people) to those of us who are actually working], people are unwilling to work in the bottom end jobs in the supply chain. Food distribution companies are cutting hours for drivers because no one will work in the warehouses. Likewise, finding services [such as food] while driving local is bad enough, but over the road it's horrible.

questions 2-4] No comment
question 5] I do not believe climate change has had any impact on the supply chain, except in having to pay for DEF, which I've yet to have anyone be able to explain what it does. The need to shell out for all electric truck will impact the future [electric trucks are slower and can haul less weight, plus cost more with very little future savings on fuel since we'll eventually have to pay for said electricity].

question 6] Electronic logging is creating issues. Yes, I know saying that it was easier when we could fudge the books a bit is not what anyone wants to say to the DoT, but when you get stuck in the backup for an accident for 3 hours, that puts the load at LEAST 3 hours behind, and maybe a whole day if that 3 hours puts you past the time limit for the day. I know it is illegal, but back when we could simply claim we were sitting in a truck stop rather than behind the wheel, this was not nearly as big of a problem. Also, they often record idling as driving, but not always.

question 7] Going union is a terrible idea. Quite apart from the Teamsters being crooked as all hell [were joining is NOT optional, but a life or death requirement], but any union, even the good ones, promote lazy/slow workers. I have been on a union dock and had the five pound box of pencils I was delivering ripped out of my hands and thrown out the door and was told that only union workers are allowed to unload a truck. I have often been forced to wait for several hours after my load was finished for a union yard jockey to move my trailer from a dock. And in one memorable occasion, get of his fork and lay down to take a nap on my freight while in my trailer.
On the other hand, docks making drivers hire lumpers should be made illegal. If a dock is unwilling to hire workers, then they should allow the drivers to load/unload themselves.

question 8] Hours of service. I do NOT advocate for getting rid of them, but rather loosening them a smidge.

question 9, 10, 11 and 12] no comment

question 13] Different speed limits for trucks. Having semis have to go 10 miles slower than a car, at least when enforced, is a major stumbling block and serves no purpose except an excuse to ticket a truck driver. And now with ELDs, these can be enforced days after it happened. Likewise, lane restrictions through places like Chicago were trucks are stuck in what amounts to feeder roads [at reduced speeds compared to cars] with cars zipping back in forth across lanes and creating a much larger safety issue than simply allowing trucks to drive the same speed in the same lanes.",,,,,,,

If conductors could report all the issues they fix on the FRA tie up screen, I believe a patter would emerge showing that keeping two people in the cab of every fright train decreases delays to freight. If conductors are moved to a ground based position, which is something all Class 1 railroads want to do, delays will increase significantly. Having the conductor on the train available to respond to all immediate issues is just one way to keep delays to a minimum.

I am a conductor for a Class 1 railroad and I have a personal example of how I was able to respond to a situation and decrease the delay to the freight on my train. The area where this situation had taken place was Cantera Loop in Dunsmuir California. The air flow in the brake system increased to the point that the air brakes on the rear half of my train applied by themselves and brought the train to a sudden stop. I was able to respond immediately by getting onto the ground and applying enough hand brakes to hold the train where it was, I needed to do this because as soon as I was able to identify and fix the problem the air brakes would release and the train could roll away uncontrolled. With this example in mind, if I were to be a ground based conductor my response time would have been in excess of an hour. In order to reach the train I would have to use a hi-rail vehicle to drive on the track because of access issues. I would have to contact dispatch to remove all rail that would be used to drive on out of service, I would have to drive several miles by rail to reach the train, then I would have to park the vehicle then start applying hand brakes. 

If you want to keep delays to a minimum and keep freight moving, keep a qualified conductor and qualified engineer in the cab of every freight train. ",,,,,,,

I've personally had a CDL since the 80s, I would driver OTR for a couple of years,  work local for a year or 2 and repeat OTR . This kept me fresh and safe.  In 2017 I got carbon monoxide poisoning in a truck and it gave me some long term issues.  Since I couldn't renew my medical card,  my license was downgraded.    NOW that I'm able to work and pass a DOT physical I would first need to take a CDL test and driving test to get my CDL and I promise that will never happen. I have 4 million miles accident free driving,  I'm not starting over.  My story is the same with tens of thousands who would get back into a truck but sick of overboard over regulations.  The trucking industry is the most regulated industry in the country and it's made possible by a minority of very rich mega carriers who could care less about drivers, they just replace them with younger inexperienced drivers. I have my own DOT number  and MC number,  high insurance requirements, and larger companies under bidding us took the company out. The sad thing was our 100% on time, 100% accident free record with our main customer was replaced with cheaper inexperienced drivers who had a 80% accident free record. Hauling 18ft tall loads, the 20% accident rate was costly.  You get what you pay for.
I truly hope you guys listen to the drivers who have tirelessly kept this country running smoothly, the industry went down hill due to over regulations pre 2016 and never recovered.

I can tell you having just recently left a intermodal company I was leased with. It’s a matter of everybody trying to get their hand in the cookie jar and no matter how efficient the drivers or some companies try to be, there is always somebody trying to take advantage to get more money. For example, I used to run a load from Houston,TX to Seminole Oklahoma for wrangler jeans. I would get there and drop and hook the chassis inbox and pick up a completely empty box. I can make it back to as far as Durant,OK before I would have to do my DOT required break break. The next day I would drive the remainder of the trip to Houston,TX. However, the next day they want you to get another box and go back to Dallas and load at this place called XPO logistics. I pointed out to the company that instead of coming all the way home the Second day. I could take the original empty chassis and load at XPO on the way home. I could do it for half the price of the original load. If they would still pay me my original mileage for the original load. And I would save all the fuel from having to make two trips. Basically combining two trips until one. I was fough at every turn. For me trying to be environmentally savvy and saving on fuel it makes sense to not have to make two trips when I can do two trips in one. But then the companies involved start arguing about switching over intermodal boxes, saying they can’t trade loads when they do it all the time. Being able to combine trips like this would improve logistics and be more beneficial to the environment as well as we would not be spending as much in fuel cost and not putting unnecessary emissions into the atmosphere. There is plenty of freight for all the drivers. Another issue is that so many trucks now are having issues with the DEF systems. I personally know many people who have had them deleted because the parts to replace them now are unavailable due to Covid and they will be out of business if they stay in compliance. They have basically become outlaw truckers, just in order to stay in business. A person I know recently was told that a part to keep his injectors going on his DEF used to be $500. Because of limited supply that part is now $1700. And the mechanics cannot guarantee that it would even work or if it would last. It was more beneficial to them to have their systems deleted. Mine is still working so I still have mine. But some of the older drivers who have older trucks are doing this just to be able to stay in business. Also, I completely agree with DOT regulations. And that trucks should be kept up-to-date. But unfortunately pulling over a big truck has become a massive money making opportunity for some of the small towns along the interstate. Also not counting the checkpoints that the state governments have set up. They no longer have enough officers to keep up with the amount of trucks going through and I’ve started subcontracting people to help them do inspections. Some of the fines for something as simple as having a wire touching another wire but not even being a problem can be several hundred dollars. Other violations can start ranging into the thousands. It has made it where people don’t want to even be involved in trucking. I know gentleman who are essentially retired now but still have the physical ability to drive but won’t, because it’s such a hassle nowadays. I personally run hazmat, primarily fuel. So it is required for me to keep my stuff up-to-date all the time. Very critical  To be safe operation of my vehicle. However, the level of harassment we face from local authorities that target us consistently almost makes people wish that there was something else we could do. Even officers that had just pulled you over three days before, will pull you over again and make you go through the same harassment. It’s time consuming and very tedious at times. One city official in the town of La Porte Texas, actually told their officers not to pull over people they thought might be illegals because there was less than 30% chance of collecting revenue from that ticket. That person actually used the word revenue. And I think that sums up the issue in certain areas.",,,,,,,

This would disappear with a single crew member as the engineer must stay at the controls of the locomotive. Each crew member also watches over the other if there happens to be a health issue with his or her counterpart. No railroads have a solution to these problems. They only wish to cut union jobs to make a few more dollars for their stock holders. Let's not sacrifice safety to fill the pockets of big corporations.

 Cutting half the workforce not only hurts incomes but local economies as well. For most towns, the railroads are a major employer in the community.

Oddly, they understand that it’s not the best decision to let drivers drive the max speed limits that’s why most trucks are governed at 65 mph yet they will max out our hours . Seventy hour work weeks are crushing us ! Then these companies have the audacity to put cameras in front of our faces and nit pick about our driving. Ominous threats of nuclear lawsuits advertised through billboards also negatively impacting the overall morale of the typical truck driver  . From a financial stand point it may look like an attractive industry from the outside however between over regulation and desperate companies ; once in this industry,any highlights are diminished. I’m going on 5 years driving a commercial vehicle and I’m convinced having seen my fellow peers in the work place that the trucking industry’s economic model was never meant for big truck companies to expand in the way they have . Owner operators hold higher standards to their equipment and overall are more dedicated to the practice than any trucking company ever will be . Moving on to my next points , truck drivers waste ridiculous amounts of time loading and unloading (upwards of 8 hours) 9 times out of 10 are not compensated fairly for their wait times. The trucking industry in California is the worst in the country due to slower speed limits and traffic congestion. Back in 2018 the average time I spent stuck in Los Angeles traffic was about 6-7 hours. This would be traveling out of Compton,Ca to  interstate 20 to Beaumont, Ca . Between the lack of parking to the detached reality/  entitlement  of the public I don’t see much improvement in this industry any time soon. Most experienced truck drivers knew the negative impact of over regulation and stricter laws before they were passed . We’re unfortunately dealing with the chronically poor decisions  made by the administration and it will have a lasting negative impact on the industry for years to come . I strongly believe this is why the government is at a loss on how to fix the trucking industry. Truth be told … it was never broken to begin with until over taxation , over regulation and monopolization happened within the last decade . Clearly , e.l.d.s  are not correlating with lower accidents as accident rates have actually gone up higher . Hold the general public to a higher standard when it comes to driving on public roadways . Also , remove marijuana usage from employment & federal drug screen panels . Marijuana should be treated like alcohol ; only permitted when at home and not in a commercial vehicles. I trust the deficit of truck drivers would go down if the government used leniency in respects to that . I will point out that about half of drug and alcohol violations are that of Marijuana.

The port truckers are the largest port stakeholders yet we are the most marginalized and disenfranchised stakeholders. The ports have an inconvenient schedule for servicing trucks. The ports are open 24/7 to service the ships but are not open all day for trucks which causes us to to race back to the port before they close. If we get their after they close, the containers sit for the night at the motor carriers drop yard. 

We also need to be included in the UIIA agreement because it’s effecting us and we have no say in it. The drayage industry is too abusive to the truckers. The UIIA agreement institutionalizes robbing the owner operators of hours of unpaid time. We can be stuck in the port frim two to four hours without getting paid detention time. And if we get a trouble ticket, the clock resets. This is why no one wants to be a port trucker. 

The lease agreements between drayage owner operators and motor carriers are very abusive. The owner operators are left with all the liability while the motor carriers have no responsibility.

Almost all of the problems I have encountered in the supply chain are caused by incompetence and mismanagement by office workers who actively hinder their own drivers. 

For instance, recently one of our drivers was delivering to a Walmart distribution center in Utah and they demanded a delivery that would have required him to illegally drive 85mph to make the appointment. They refused to set another appointment and the driver was unable to deliver at the impossible appointment time. Walmart responded by forcing our driver to sit for THREE DAYS in retaliation for missing the impossible appointment. 

Another similar even occurred with a driver delivering to a Target distribution center in Kansas. He was unable to make an impossible delivery appointment, and was held forced to wait several days to be unloaded as punishment for something he had no control over.

Out of the 70 hours per week that drivers are allowed, roughly 25 of those hours are wasted by office workers playing games with delivery times. This constant intentional disruption of deliveries by customers reduces industry capacity by nearly 30%. 

It is already against Federal law to interfere with interstate commerce. I suggest enforcing this law against companies who choose to willingly disrupt their own delivery drivers, which then interferes with deliveries for the following customers. Their behavior causes a cascade of late deliveries and massively disrupts commerce. ",,,,,,,

The AgTC points out that at the center of the growing crisis is a lack of outbound capacity due to carriers filling their ships with empty containers instead of containers full of American products.

While the issues faced by US exports are currently worse than they have ever been, they are not new. Ever since I started my career in Shipping in 1989, I have seen the same issues arise again and again. Despite the many new technologies that are available today, nothing has been able to eliminate empty vs. full container imbalances and relieve congestion issues.

I would like to propose a concept for separating empty and full container movements to allow for more productive operations. There are several key benefits of separating empty and full transportation:

1.	Carriers will have no incentive to fill their ships on the outbound leg with empty containers, thus providing capacity for US exports.
2.	Port congestion can be reduced, as containers can exit the terminals more quickly.
3.	Empty containers can be moved to less-trafficked ports, thus reducing the road congestion around many of America’s largest ports. Note that this has environmental benefits as well.

The key to carrying out my proposed solution of separating empty and full container movements is to build specialized vessels for empty containers and offer specialized empty container repositioning services between in the US and Asia.

We kindly request your support in starting our empty repositioning services and in designing, producing and deploying state of the art, low-emission empty loader vessels.

With your support we would be able to reposition empty refrigerated and empty twenty-foot containers to the US, which is much needed to accommodate the current bookings. Furthermore, relieving the current empty crisis will lead directly to a boost in US exports. With this plan, we

will gradually reduce the trade imbalance. US farmers and ranchers will be very pleased to see this solution.

This proposal is also a win-win situation for everyone involved: Shippers, who will receive outbound capacity again, West Coast terminals and trucking companies, who will have higher throughput, productivity and revenue, and shipping carriers will have their ships filled with goods, improve their schedule reliability, and reduce their proforma cost.

I look forward to moving forward with this plan in conjunction with the local terminals on the West Coast and the shipping lines. Your support will be critical in getting started. I plan to begin operations as soon as possible with conventional vessels, and transition to specialized vessels within 18 months.

I am very certain that this method will provide both short- and long-term benefits to the economy and to the environment.

I am open to further discussion and look forward to your support. Sincerely,

Why do we have 3 clocks? A 14 hour, 11 hour and our own Circadian Rhythm?
Now that blood tests can reveal a person's individual Circadian, we need people to stop bugging us over that!
Seriously, what person goes home after driving to and from work, cooks, mows the lawn, give kids baths,prepares meals,lunches and DOES NOT work more than a 14 hour day?
We have the Drug/Alcohol clearing house,we need Detention pay, extended HOS.
I am an OTR driver ,all truckers that I know seeing the ELD as an electronic that will just switch you automatically when you're trying to park, look for your next empty trailer, any time you don't give it your FULL attention,  it switches you onto the drive line!!
It makes us crazy!
Nobody can obey it, so we're becoming owner operators out of necessity, higher pay for loads.
We're out here 24/7 trying to leave our friends and family behind every day and make money.
We don't need more hometime, just longer hours to drive..
Please stop the clocks for us, we're either sleeping for 8 hours or in need to move out and roll our wheels to make money.
Fleet owners only like to pay local drivers an hourly wage because they drop a trailer and hook another one many times in a day!",,,,,,,

If I can drive throughout the whole pandemic and not have the vaccine I’m not going to take it now. Logs are suspended every time there was a supply chain break. Why can I not choose to drive as much as I think it’s safe? Parking is a big issue. A lot of municipalities have made it illegal for trucks to park. Yet they still want to have a supply chain and not provide places for us to park and rest. Certain states are starting to try to text us even more, the government already taxes us extremely high on fuel and IFTA taxes. Yes some of these states are wanting to start charging us more to drive in their state. All this does is increase the cost for the consumer. All the toll roads that have been put in, we already pay those high taxes to help with the roads yet we pay higher tolls. Every chance the government gets they come after truckers. Now they are trying to push us out of a job Bye putting robots on the road. Here’s something you guys don’t realize all those cameras work great in great weather conditions. The truck I drive now has some of those sensors, when it rains too hard they don’t work. In the snow and sleet those cameras and sensors are covered with a sleet. I could go on but why bother. People want to have their shell stocked, but do not want to see truckers on their roads or highways.

Unfortunately, the United States of America has experienced an oversized burden as a result of these disruptions - especially in the Critical Manufacturing Sectors defined by the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (www.cisa.gov).  While shifts in demand for goods and supply chain capacity will always exist in a global economy, the best way to increase domestic supply chain resilience while reducing exposure to global supply chain disruption is to shorten the chain itself.

The shortening of the supply chain is most effectively accomplished by re-shoring and/or nearshoring the production and manufacturing capabilities that were previously a significant part of our nation's economy.  Doing this will reduce the time needed for Americans to realize benefit from adjustments made by stakeholders throughout the supply chain - from raw material producers to the consumer.  The cost savings from an outsourced automotive part manufactured in Asia cannot be realized if the part is adrift in the Pacific Ocean while the container ship waits for berth space at a West Coast port - especially if that part triggers an assembly line shut-down.

The United States of America is arguably the global leader in the safe and efficient movement of freight.  While our domestic transportation infrastructure certainly has room for improvement, much more immediate and meaningful impact will occur when we resume the manufacture of important goods in closer proximity to our nation.",,,,,,,

These adjustments were often made because the HOS rules didn't fit with the drivers NEED for sleep. If we look at the drivers daily priorities, before and after the ELD, we will see a subtle adjustment, which I believe is at the core of the crash increases. I wish I knew why the ""sleeper study"" was canceled. We could have gotten a lot of useful data that we could have used today. I would immediately restart this study on a very long term basis. Circadian rhythms of the OTR trucker needs  to be studied over at least 3 months and at least 1000 drivers. For a quick fix, I suggest immediately implementing a 96 hour rule. When an OTR driver is fresh off a reset, his circadian rhythm will be askew. Well rested and ready to ""get er done"", this driver may need a nap 4 hours into his day. Before the ELD, this driver would stop, take his nap, leave his log open and hope for the best. Later, he would add that nap to his next nap,meal,fuel, and shower. This is just one of many scenarios a sleeper study could look at. When I was OTR, this was a common scenario for me(minus the adjustments). Sometimes(often), scheduling would dump me right into the gridlock of rush hour. Your sleeper study would show the best case scenario of what happens when a driver naps, rather than driving into gridlock. I believe the sleeper study was canceled because there is to many scenarios to hold water. 
  This is where the 96 hour rule comes in. In most cases, and the way it's supposed to work, a driver should be fresh, and ready to ""get er done"" after completing a reset. This ""freshness"" obviously deteriorates over time at different speeds, for different reasons. As this ""freshness"" deteriorates the risk for incidents increases. This is the “time” that needs to be studied with 1000 drivers over a long period of time. Now back to the quick fix. 96 hours is 4 days. A driver can make a lot of money in 4 days if he is allowed the flexibility to nap when he see's fit. After 96 hours, normal or special rules can be implemented. I see the current HOS are allowing flexibility, but in my opinion, allowing this flexibility over an 8 day period will only increase crashes. It was my experience that after using split sleeper for 4 days, I started to become a shadow of myself using caffeine,sugar,nicotine, and bad carbs, to ""get er done"". Because of the levels of these substances in my system, napping did nothing to gain back any ""freshness"". There is no logical answer to why a trucker is basically required to use caffeine,sugar,nicotine, and bad carbs, to ""get er done"". The 96 hour rule can give a driver an opportunity to get away from substances to stay awake, and simply take a nap, to gain real freshness.
  Another key factor of the 96 hour rule would be this; I’ve read about it, spoke with many drivers about it, and lived it for 12 years. When driver goes home, his sleep can be only described as a disaster. (I strongly urge you to survey this fact). The 96 hour rule allow a driver to get real, stress free, REM sleep, soon after leaving home.

Customers are delaying trucks for hours while others are loading in an hour or unloading. 3 and 4 hours and sometimes even 7 and 8 hours is inexcusable. Imagine the work that could be done in those extra hours if customers were efficient in their part of the supply chain. There is a lack of accountability in that section as well. Most do not compensate or just plain do not care. These delays also cause trucks to air idling for hours in docks if not equipped with auxiliary power units therefore making the carbon footprint larger due to excessive idling. Until customers are reigned in on their inefficiency there will always be supply chain issues and higher carbon emissions. ",,,,,,,

My name is Shawn.
I currently operate a dry van tractor trailer for Greatwide.
I have experience in flatbed and also in logistics as a field service coordinator.  
I chose to respond because I believe I can offer some insight as to the problems I have encountered as a coordinator and a driver. 

The transportation of goods. 
1. Loading. 
 A. Loading takes time, many drivers are not involved in this process. They simply back into a door and wait. This process likely can take hours to do, and the driver loses valuable time on the clock. 
 B. Lack of resources to load trucks in a safe and efficient amount of time. 
 C. Poor planning by coordinators and or dispatchers. Particularly large mega carriers. 
Properly utilizing resources should be taught. 
-Example-, Driver A unloads in Pittsburgh Pa while Driver B unloads in Philadelphia PA. 
Driver A should not dead head to Baltimore for a load, while Driver B deadheads to Cranberry township PA. (This actually happened) 

2. Transporting loaded goods. 
 A. Many drivers have a very difficult time with locating safe and legal parking. 
Many drivers are subjected to unsafe and risky situations due to lack of safe parking. 
 B. ELOGS- Drivers are almost forced to run harder than they should, to beat the clock. 
If a driver sits at a shipper or receiver and they use their clock, they don't make money. 
 
3. Pay
 A. A drivers pay for time out does not equal much when broken down. 
The cost of living on the road is very expensive. 
For example, if a driver is on layover, his rate may only be 50$ a day. 
 
The amount of time drivers put into a load does not show on their paychecks. Over the road and regional drivers are greatly effected by this. 

4. Drivers
 A. Many drivers are driving and they are DANGEROUS, this ties into the ELOGS, we are forcing drivers to get the load delivered on short time frames or in order for them to make a livable wage. 
I am all for elogs, I believe they have a purpose,  however they restrict drivers and regulations are killing the industry.  
Elogs should be looked at and changes made to accommodate certain situations.  
 B. Understanding language, we need to be able to communicate with many folks that do not understand a language we or they know or do not know. 
Signage in the US is mostly in English. 

 C. Education, many drivers do not have the education or ability to drive. 
There are several schools out there that can test their own students, and these schools should be forced by law to have a outside organization without ties to them to test drivers. 

5. Safety
The biggest part of trucking should be broken down to this single word, safety.
The general population does not understand the effort that goes into operation of a commercial vehicle. 
Therefore, commercial drivers must take into account the safety of the public. 
SMITH system training should be taught to every student that goes through schools, and trucking companies should be required to teach this basic class. 
SMITH SYSTEM works, and its a drivers friend when on the road. 

Non commercial drivers should be taught why trucks need space. 
I believe our drivers Ed and schools should teach all drivers the dangers of large vehicles.  

These are only a few of the things I chose to speak on and very minimal at that. 
These issues could be broken down and unpacked very extensively. 

I hope that I gave you a little insight as to what you are looking for and I applaud the effort being taken. 

Thanks, 
Shawn

As a driver our time is super micromanage down to the minute, which makes extended stays at shippers and receivers very difficult to deal with. I feel like requiring shippers and receivers to use up no more than two hours of overtime per visit it’s not out of line. For example when I show up to load my truck, I shouldn’t have to be there for 68 or more hours to get loaded or unloaded.
The second problem for me is the logbook. I know it’s a big deal and I’m notA “hater”, but there’s times when the logbook tells me I’m supposed to be driving but I’m too tired to drive because I just sat for six hours waiting for the clock to tick before I can legally drive. So when it’s time to drive I’m tired from sitting around for four hours doing nothing. We are not robots. I haul food exclusively for grocery store warehouses. During Covid, I was able to run with my logbook off. Now that the HOS relief is over, I am back to running when I’m tired where I never did during Covid. I’ve honestly feel like I was a safer driver when I could sleep when I was tired and drive when I’m not and was able to make that decision on my own.",,,,,,,

It is very hard for these students to come up with the funds to come through this class. I have trucking companies in each class giving presentations with tuition reimbursement but it's still not enough to get these young men and women started so I feel funding for the Community and Technical colleges would help with the issues at the current time.
I also think the hub and spoke theory would dramatically decrease the issues we're seeing at the current time in the trucking industry.

The biggest issues are manpower and parking. Those I address first.

1) Parking
The Parking Crisis is out of hand, there is many places where drivers squeeze in to truck stops, rest areas, and more trying to barely get some sleep. There are States that punish drivers, or even prevent them outright, for using off-ramps and on-ramps to rest on. 

The system lacks room for all drivers to rest at night in many regions. The solution according to some is to just have drivers pay to park everywhere at $20 a night. Where parking had been free it is no longer free in many locations. Unfortunately some drivers are spending $60 a day for food, and this on top of trying to keep a family going. They may be so squeezed for money that $20 a night, or $600 a month, is an extreme burden for them. 

The solution is simple of course, which is why no one will want to try to do it. Make it so that parking is no longer taxed based upon how much a percentage of the property is dedicated for unpaid parking locations and the driving space required to reach those unpaid parking locations. This includes convincing the States to not levy property taxes upon the same. I would suggest that we allow some paid parking but that it goes along the line of 2% of all parking can be paid but any percentage point above that means that 20% of all remaining parking cannot be tax free. This would make truck stops balance paid parking carefully versus their tax exemptions. This one thing will get me 1 million votes in the Primary according to the quiet surveys I have done. 

Another aspect will be to embarrass States that are unfriendly to drivers, highlight the States with the worst parking conditions, and make some of their transportation funding rely upon them rapidly changing the situation as can be. This includes potentially opening closed Scale Houses for parking, not closing rest areas when the parking area itself is safe, and in the construction of truck only parking in regions suffering the highest impact. 

2) Driver shortage
Do not mistake that we are in a short to medium term driver shortage. The crisis in England is going to be happening here soon as well. There are steps that are required to reduce the regulatory burden on drivers and companies that can be done by the Department of Transportation and the Federal Motor Carrier and Safety Administration. 

The first step will be to remove points associated with warnings. This was always a bad policy and will be a major part of my campaign when talking to truckers. These points have often been a point of contention and myself and other drivers have suffered from officers who either believe or are lying that they say the warnings do not create points. Often where an officer would give a single ticket they instead will find a number of issues to issue a warning over and the poor driver is punished worse than for a ticket he could legally fight in court. I expect that voters will be outraged when they hear CDL drivers cannot challenge warnings at all where a ticket has to be heard in court. Removal of the warnings points is a priority for my future administration.

Next is reforming the various company based schooling systems around the nation so that drivers are not locked into a non-compete contract at the end of their school period, where drivers have less of a burden in background checks which slows down their application process, in nationalizing the Hazmat Endorsement so certain States do not require drivers to return to the State to go through the process. 

Electronic Forms is another aspect, where right now every truck is required to carry IFTA, various State forms, and so forth in their truck I would rather an electronic method to store said documents. 

3) Equipment
The laws regarding our equipment says no lights can be in nonfunctioning order at night. I find this a burden. If a trucking company is willing to buy extra lights that can assist in preventing a problem with identifying the truck in size and scope then this should allow for a light or two to be out without a penalty at all. If we allow redundancy in lighting then the companies will surge to incorporate redundancy because this will result in less downtime during the movement of cargo. This is a major piece I am pushing that should bring many trucking companies to my table. 

Additionally we need a Federal Database of equipment issues from the larger companies, this way we can spot issues with some manufacturers and make buying a more safe process.

Removal of the DEF mandate, even if for a short term while, will help with many of the issues going on and could get some drivers to return to trucking. 

Sadly a character limit has made it so I cannot complete the 25 bullet points. However this is a great start. ",,,,,,,

Curves are not navigated properly. Driver's do not watch their mirrors. Cars are also an issue. 

Roads are so rough it makes a driver feel sick. 

Parking areas are so limited it is sometimes hard to find safe places to park. 

There is no courtesy anymore. Very aggressive, unfriendly drivers are taking over. The rule used to be that a truck always yields the right-of-way, but that is not being taught and is no longer observed.

Blinkers to signal lane changes are not used and other vehicles do not allow another vehicle to get in the lane for emergency vehicles or to get over for any reason. I cannot fathom how this has become an acceptable driving practice. 

Headlights are way too bright and some vehicles have a fog light bar that they use continuously which causes a distraction. It is unnecessary to have such bright lights. Some drivers refuse to dim their lights. Serious danger issues with these bright lights.

There are some cars that get in that left lane and do not get back in the right lane when they should. Causes serious issues.

They don’t do power moves but instead take power from trains traveling through. Every train that arrives to Green River Wyoming going east gets doubled up and power cut. Always leaving there longer and heavier and with barely enough power to make it. I believe the class 1’s are also not interested in intermodal traffic because it doesn’t pay as good as bulk and mixed manifest. So they aren’t trying to move the intermodal containers off the ships. Because of “network fluidity” there are about ten intermodal trains going each direction each day when there used to be much much more. They aren’t trying!!

Longer trains do not fit in most sidings so smaller ones are held for hours waiting to pass. 

Lack of yard crews trying to fit or work these long trains are causing hours (sometimes days) of delays as multiple long trains do not fit in yards or terminals. 

Managers declaring that a train had departed when its just dragged out side of a yard, it’s engines removed and sits until crews or other engines are available (but shows it left) - and likewise trains at the terminal but since it never “hit the switch” it doesn’t show an arrival.  

All this skews actual transit times, reporting metrics and leads customers, suppliers and overseers to misleading information. Customers cannot accurately plan for service as none of the times are accurate/reliable. 

When brought to the attention of supervisors/management, it’s brushed off and the behavior while officially condoned, is entouraged from senior leadership. 

Technology such as EMS systems run the trains underspeed, improper training handling and other delay causing features which is well known, but employees are threatened with discipline if not used. 

Again, we are giving the America people lip service but the companies are still pulling the wool over everyone’s eyes. ",,,,,,,

I have never heard of another job/profession/occupation in the U.S. that requires/forces their workers to work for free. I would bet that would be illegal. The people loading or unloading the truck driver's trailer aren't required to work 2-3 hours for nothing, I bet. Truck drivers get paid by the miles they run. The Government regulates/mandates how many hours they can run/drive. Most don't get paid for sitting at a dock, but they should because that is counting against the time they can drive. Since they don't get paid for sitting at that dock for hours, the natural thing to do is hurry, rush, drive faster maybe than they normally would make up for the lost time. There are a lot of problems in the trucking industry. Parking is another major problem.",,,,,,,

When driving and trying not to violate the 11 hour drive time rule, and also finding a parking spot is unbelievably hard. I have pass several tax payer funded locations that have barriers or cones that are blocking entranaces to weigh stations or rest areas or what used to be these locations that could be opened up and maintained to how they were before being closed and used as parking. 
My main route is I40 and I pass several areas that appear they were rest areas that had buildings removed, which is fine trucks have parking without facilities and they use those spots. Add a dumpster and a port o potty and most people would be happy.  The main thing is safe parking so we aren’t on the side of the road.

The other thing I have thought of and it would take a lot of revamping, but what about showers at rest areas. The rest area could charge $10 a shower which would create revenue to employ one or two people for cleaning and accounting. It would create jobs, and extra revenue as well as a more regulated market for showers other than paying $15-20 a shower at loves or pilot.  It may not be ethical for every rest stop but it would be for some. 10 showers at $10 is $100 and you could probably average 20 showers an hour. You wouldn’t have to have them designed like loves or other truck stops because it would be just a shower. It could be paid for by app or even fmcsa Id verification so that it’s verified the guest is a commercial driver.  Having the shower option would help with the 30 minute break mandate as well because you wouldn’t have congested truck stops or parking areas and would make it a more hygiene friendly industry. Some of these drivers do not know what hygiene is. 

I know we are in a pandemic and it would be hard to justify the cleaning but if the major 5 truck stops are doing it. It can be done. 

The other thing is a standard minimum wage for paying drivers per mile. There is no guidelines other than minimum wage. The company I’m with currently starts a team driver at .27 cpm and they have no intentions on increasing it. If it were more regulated it would create a better job market and a more fair opportunity for all companies to stay on par. Standard of living rises, so should wages for drivers",,,,,,,

Truck driving is the most over regulated industry in the United States, Log books, electronic log books, fines for minor safety violation that count against our drivers license, no access to decent available truck parking which congress just killed in a latest bill.  We get charged up to $20 if we wish to pay for a reserved spot at a truck stop, but congress will not enact a law giving owners of truck stops aid on their property taxes.

Along with increasing truck accidents they make delivering essential goods such as food harder than it has to be. When it comes down to it you’re driving while tired and trying to sleep while being wide awake. They force drivers to run over the speed limit and drive while tired thus increasing truck wrecks. We saw a decrease in truck wrecks during the hours of service exemption during COVID. This is because we could take our time, drive the speed limit, and stop for a nap without running out of hours. Also I think I speak for all truck drivers when I say we are under appreciated. We are looked down on and over regulated until America faces something like the covid pandemic. When essential items needed delivered we delivered them, we were exempt from hours of service and like I previously said truck wrecks also decreased. But the minute stores got restocked and everyone got what they needed we went back to being looked down on and mistreated. The problems creating the “driver shortage” and the product shortage begins at the top with the FMCSA over regulating truck drivers and the ATA creating poor work conditions and poor pay for their drivers. We are the backbone of America we proved that during the pandemic and we are tired of being micro managed and looked down on by the FMCSA!",,,,,,,

Emissions control measures have been decreasing fuel economy and reliability. And amid the computer chip shortage trucks have been sitting in mechanic parking lots for months. Most of these breakdowns are due to emissions systems causing the engines to work harder and use more fuel. This reduces engine life and more breakdowns 

Electronic logs are causing issues with hours of service. If you pickup a delivery today you will usually work a 14 hour day causing you to wake up later tomorrow and it is impossible to work a normal schedule. One day you will work during the day and the next day you will be driving until late at night. This is causing more exhaustion for drivers who cannot maintain a set schedule for when they are actually awake and tired. You cannot force sleep when you are awake. There should be more freedom for drivers to drive when they are not tired and sleep when they are tired. I often find myself exhausted when my log tells me I can drive. And me sleeping extra hours to compensate and missing my delivery schedule 

Parking for trucks is extremely limited for drivers who are trying to sleep at night. There are acres upon acres of abandoned parking all across America but are illegal for drivers to park at. These can be utilized in cities to allow drivers to arrive mere minutes away from their deliveries to start their next day with a new hours of service log but instead drivers will often be forced to sleep hours away from their destinations causing late deliveries and longer days and more stress on the warehouses. There should be plenty of designated parking with no amenities where drivers can park outside of major cities. They do not need to be occupied by employees therefore they will not cost a premium to operate.

Training for drivers to obtain their CDL does not teach you a single thing about operating a CMV you need to abandon the current process and include education and driving tests that actually test a persons ability to drive a CMV the current CDL process is a joke. Students are taught to do the same process over and over again turning an actual skill into a habit and that is the only reason anyone passes the test. I have never parallel parked a CMV in my entire career and the fact that it is on the test is laughable. This is the reason so many CMV’s are involved in accidents because the drivers face problems on the road that they’ve never been prepared for. To offset better schooling our governments should introduce scholarships and grants for any person wishing to obtain a CDL this would introduce many more CDL applicants to offset the shortage of drivers. As many of my friends have always wanted to drive like me but do not have the funds available to obtain one. Free school through companies needs to be banned as students are forced into a contract and end up running from the industry as fast as they joined due to companies taking advantage of students and having the debt hung over their heads when they realize they chose a bad company. 

Warehouses do not always stay true to their shipping and receiving appointments. 7 loads out of 10 I am held at shippers and receivers for 5-10 hours. Causing my hours of service to limit my driving down to just a few hours after pickup or delivery. These days are extremely tough as they end up turning into a 14 hour day. In instances like this I have to wake up 2-4 hours later the next day causing me to stay up 2-4 hours later the next day depending on circumstances. This causes fatigue as I am expected to use my entire day by shippers and receivers between deliveries

Change the hours of service to 12 hours on duty/driving and 12 hours off duty/sleeper. Use the hours as needed during a 24hr period.  
Instead of carpool lanes put express truck lanes thru city's so they don't get stuck in traffic. Lower toll fees for roads and bridges. 
One speed limit thru out the US. 
Require all states to install pre pass and use them. Weigh in motion before prepass if that is preferred. 
Ban automatic license (I don't care what they drive but they should know how to shift gears)
Remove mandatory Def on trucks. It's not helping the ozone and repairs are extremely expensive.  
The biggest problem is the brokers of the loads are setting the time from pick up to delivery and we are not getting enough time to deliver.  Limiting brokers to set distance traveled per day will ease driver fatigue. Along with 12 hours of work per day and be able to sleep when you are tired with out running out of hours will keep drivers refreshed and alert. 
12 hr rule as a trucker uses it..
You are allowed to drive/work 12 hour every 24 hours. (Goodbye 14 hr rule) 
Let's start at 00:00am(sleeper for say 6 hrs)
So if a driver leaves his stop after 2 hrs of work and drives for 4 hours' that's 6 hrs off his day clock of 12hrs. And takes a 4 hrs nap. He/she can still drive for 6 hrs and has to sleep or off duty for the remaining 8hrs- midnight.
2 hrs working
4 hrs driving 
6 hrs driving
=12 day
4 sleeper
8hrs sleeper
=12
That's a day fully used
Total hours each week should be 72 with one full 36 hrs off to relax do laundry and forget about driving.

From reading a few of the comments already, truckers seem to be having the most trouble from not being trained properly, not gaining enough rest, not having safe enough rest stops, and so much more; these shouldn't be problems. Passing this order right now will only put more stress on supply chain companies because they have to be on their ""A-Game"" regardless of their other issues. In the future, this will cause more problems than they already have now.

ELDs are definitely one of the anchors that truckers have to work with, and they single handedly took a knife to productivity in the trucking sector.  This was done deliberately by the huge carriers and some in other sectors, ie Rand McNally, in order to hold on to their market share while dealing with their through the roof driver turnover.  This smoke and mirrors show was sold as a safety enhancement tool, and nothing could be further from the truth.  The Safety Alliance group who lobbied ( bought) enough influence to get this mandated should be held accountable for this travesty.

Pleasant","TN","38474","United States",,,,,,,"Times have changed a lot in the past 85 years in the trucking industry. More regulation has caused a lot of that change. ELDs caused even more change, unfortunately, we still are held back in the time of the '30s. Truck drivers are required or forced to work for free many hours a week. The Government restricts the amount of time a driver can work and make money. Elds cause drivers to rush, hurry, speed, cut corners to save every precious minute they can in a day. ELDs are in exact time where paper logs are in 15-minute increments. Drivers never know when they may need a minute later that day or 6-7 days down the road. The Government thinks that is a big deal I guess, and it is. Otherwise, why would they exempt livestock haulers from using ELDs? They think that 15 minutes increments are safer for livestock, too bad they don't think the lives of other truck drivers and the people on the highways are as important. The rules and regulations should change with the times and be pretty much the same for all that use the same roads. Why is it safer for livestock haulers not to use an ELD, but it's safer for others to use one? Truck drivers are not held under the so-called Fair Labor Standards Act, otherwise, they would be paid for all hours worked. Sitting at a dock is work for truck drivers, it is counting against their clock. That is most of the time unless they can fudge/lie on their ELD, same as paper logs. That is what the Government forces truck drivers to do, have been for years. It's a little harder with ELDs, but it can be done. That is what the Government has done with livestock haulers by exempting them from ELDs. They are giving them permission to fudge/lie on their logbooks. But why? Get rid of the stupid, outdated 70-hour clock/rule. Pay drivers for all hours, at least for on-duty or on-duty not driving time. If someone is away from home, let them run/work/drive, making money, not sitting in a truck stop for nothing trying to gain hours so they can drive. This is not a one-size-fits-all job. Everyone is different, they have different sleeping habits, some need more, some need less.

 Cutting half the workforce not only hurts incomes but local economies as well. For most towns, the railroads are a major employer in the community. We do not need to risk safety and livelihoods to make more money for railroads. Many already hit record profits every quarter. Who will watch out for our communities, our union jobs and safety?

However, the supply chain is bigger than just interstate commerce but internationally the supply chain has been affected.

2. Better parking areas that have bathrooms for the drivers, and not have law enforcement waking you up telling you have to leave.

3. Start getting on shippers and receivers for holding up the driver, and stop charging lumber fees, If the Food Lion, Public, etc. ordered it let them pay the lumber fee.

4. Start inspecting cars and pickup trucks like DOT inspect us, seen to many cars and pickups with headlight, tail light, brake light not working. If you start looking at them, the fines alone will pay for new roads and equipment.

5. Better pay.

6. Better health insurance.

7. If you have a truck stop, make sure it has a 24/7/365 sit down restaurant.

8. Security for rest areas and truck strops so the drivers can sleep in peace.

Incompetence vs conspiracy vs just lucky investments. 

On 1/21/2021 President Obama fulfilled his campaign promise by canceling Keystone XL pipeline by executive order. Since that time numerous pipeline projects in the US have been cancelled including as Byhalia Connection and Penn East pipelines to name a few. 

Many more are being aborted as their prospective developers do not seek to plan new projects given the current regulatory environment. 

This has increasingly forced more energy onto the North American (NA) rail system, as well as greater imports. 

Not surprisingly this has profited railroad companies immensely as they seek to leverage their position as the ""last marginal barrel"" provider to extract huge rents on their users. 

This has prioritized energy transport in our transportation and railroad system to the exclusion of lower margin, and lower profit, container shipping, while allowing railroads massive spikes in profits. 

Step 2 the cartelization of NA railroads

As on deep dives into the ownership of the NA rail lines one finds a collection of a very same few hedge funds owning large stakes in  the few large rail companies that control and serve rail traffic in and out of the NA Pacific Coast ports from Port Rupert down to the port of Cardenas in Michicoan Mexico. 

These hedge funds along with large individual investors are seemingly dominated by Democrat Party and left wing, aligned large donors who also seemed to benefit massively from the cancelation of pipelines after protest by environmental, and native American activist groups. 

More interestingly is how when seemingly non-sligned NA railroads seek to expand to take advantage of the increased container shipping traffic and spike in rates, they face rail blockades by similar left wing aligned groups with similar donors as we see with pipeline protests. This occured in both Canada and with Kansas Southern in Mexico, causing it to lose shippers and cancel massive expansion plans to serve the US market. 

One can imagine if UP tried to expand its container business it would face a similar blockade with no relief by any West Coast governor or the Federal government.  

Step 3 Closing of the ports by slow rolling shipments.

Currently all the major west coast ports in the US are under control of exclusively Democrat party Port Authority commissioners. 

Despite huge back up of ships outside their ports (88 outside Long Beach LA and 40+ in the Puget Sound) these Port Authorities refuse to hire more workers, or incentivize more work from current workers. This means that intracontinental shippers are foreclosed from using water routes for transporting goods, especially if they are under just in time contracts. This of course forces them to pay either huge surcharges to gain access to limited if available railroad slots, or to truck the goods, if they are to maintain there businesses and contracts. 

Step 5 The Cascade

As companies are left with only trucks to fill the last marginal shipping positions, commercially licensed truckers have found huge profits in serving these customers (God  Bless these truckers!!!).  This has caused them to leave short haul jobs in order to maximize return of their time and efforts. 

This has caused a shortage at ports that now has collapsed their ability to move cargo to and from ports. Which further disincentivizes truckers from serving these routes as they are faced with huge waits going to and from congested ports and warehouses often parking unloaded trucks at port associated warehouses so they can take another truck to transport another container, causing equipment shortages and contesting warehouses. 

Add to this, the inability of Port associated warehouses to clear their inventories by ship or rail, goods coming into Port, now have nowhere to go which means those unloaded trucks at the warehouses stay parked and are unavailable for on loading and off loading boats, slowing shipping times further, tying up more ships outside ports, awaiting to off load and onload containers. 

This has limited shipping ability and has caused a massive spike in all US TEU shipping costs including in the Atlantic Ocean as well as the Pacific. 

These costs are set to spiral upward more, as truckers leave the ports to earn increasingly more money in increasingly desperate last marginal shipments across country to increasingly desperate businesses who blindly followed the ""just in time corporate group think. 

Step 6 Embrace the suck, fix it, or at least make sure it doesn't get worse. 

DOT needs to 1st make sure no rail blockades occur in this country. If they do, DOT must act very swiftly and forcibly to end them. They must have an emergency response team ready, with emergency regulatory and controlling legal authority in place to to take immediate action if a blockade is threatened or occurs. These response teams should be ready & trained

The response teams need to be trained through exercises with the national uard units in each state and with red team legal teams, to see how they can fight legal actions, and promulgate rules or have needed laws passed, ahead of time. 

All railroad mergers including, and especially Kansas Southern must be blocked. BNSF must be broken up. Major investors in competing railroads must be regulated to ensure either they are corporate governance neutral, or are not allowed at all. 

Step 3 Ports and their refusal to hire more workers are highlighted. Taft Hartley invoked to seize these ports and have them turned over to competing shipping coops to foster competition. 

Develop west coast ports in Democrat less friendly areas like San Diego, and Grey's Harbor WA, and Port Angeles (Also building rail lines to Port Angeles).

Seek legislation to increase investment in inventory and warehousing at industries to help them develop away from the failed ""just in time"" business practices that rely on foreign and long distance shipping. 

Develop redvteams along with DOD, and CDC to identify strategic chokepoints and vulnerabilities, that could be exploited by nefarious foreign, businessnnor political actors that threaten are strategic and corporate supply chains. Make sure those teams are staffed with ideologically diverse members across the country, and outside the parameters of governmental group think. 

Lastly, recognize this is a crisis. Something the DOT has failed to publicly admit or promote. 

Use your testimony to Congress and your public affairs officers to speak honestly and forthrightly about the crisis, it's origins, and where DOT and the administration haveade mistakesn and where they will seek to correct those mistakes. 

Approve all pipelines in order to alleviate surface transportation and rail congestion.

I will be short and get straight to the point with my opinion as to what is causing and could keep causing disruptions in the supply chain. Having first hand experience as an owner operator, the number one issue we face currently is the amount of detention and sometimes layovers at shippers and receivers. Many times brokers refuse to reimburse for these and it disincentives these warehouses to move efficiently and get the trucks in and out. I believe that once this gets solved it will greatly improve the flow of commercial traffic which in turn will help the supply chain. Second issue that is now just starting to get very bad is the lack of parts for semi trucks and trailers. It is getting so bad that basic things such as belts filters and oil are getting hard to find if not impossible. I personally know 3 people that were forced to park their trucks and sit at home because of the lack of parts to repair their trucks. If it gets bad enough with parts, trucks will not be able to run to supply anything anymore obviously. These two issues are what I see that is causing and is going to worsen the supply chain disruption. ",,,,,,,

This in ability directly correlates to policy as much as you dont want to hear it, EPA, ELD mandate, all the other constructions to the transportation sector are a huge cause..now we have covid more rules a possible mandate that many drivers and transportation workers from manufacturing to product will deny, leading to further shortage. Technology advances are creating a complacent driver and shipping model, driverless trucks are certainly not the answer that idea will end badly one full tanker high jacked is all it will take, one load of high profile goods stolen the list goes on and on, terrorist play ground is all im saying.
Our supply chain is held together by a rubber band all you have to do is look at shipping rates over the last 10 yrs we get an influx of freight do to disaster or economic boom or restrictive policy it creates a back up rates go up, as drivers and the industry catches up the rates drop. But if you notice alot of the repetition in this article is government involvement, ill quote former President Regan “if the government would just quietly step aside, the american people would never miss them” in short you wanna fix supply reduce regulation across the board, increase training requirements, maintenance checks, and liability of individuals, if i make a bad decision I should be responsible for my decision not my industry and in my point of view if Joe Hauler has a bad wreck and there is a fatality or multiple behicle accident the government feels its there reaponsibilty to fix the industry its not take action against the driver not the industry. 
You people have taken away our ability to operate thats not even including insurence fuel cost or taxation ",,,,,,,

I have been a trucker for 36 years.  There are a large number of things that affect trucking, which always falls on deaf ears to anyone in relevant government positions could listen to and take heed.

The supply chain regarding the trucking industry and the issues related to it are as follows:
1.  Truckers tired of unending regulations.  You tell us when to sleep, take our breaks and drive.  You have a one-size-fits-all approach to truck drivers, millions of us. You apparently think that millions of people all have the same sleeping needs.  I don't need 10 hour breaks. I sleep 6 to 7 hours and I'm good to go, as many other drivers are.  

2. The introduction of ELD's.  Guess what happened to those 50 extra miles that drivers could get away with on paper logs? Now they are sitting that 50 miles out from the shipper or receiver instead of simply being able to drive there and get the load delivered or loaded onto the truck. I can't say how many times I've been 20, 30, 50 miles out, felt fine, wide awake, didn't need a break but was forced to because of this ELD mandate.

3.  The ELD mandate caused huge problems for truck drivers to find parking spots.  So now, we stop earlier because we don't want to get on and off the highway looking for a place to sleep for the night.  We don't get as much driving done as we did before the ELD mandate.  You can sit there and tell us how wonderful it is all you want, and you can also live with the aftermath of loads not getting to their destinations on time.

4. Clogged Interstates, too much traffic.  I won't even start on how many Interstate corridors are clogged up with too much traffic.  It slows truckers down.  It also doesn't help the endless construction sites that also slow down the trips.  I predict that if this infrastructure bill goes through, the ensuing construction going on everywhere is going to bring the trucking industry to a near-grinding halt.  Yet, many Interstate corridors need to be expanded from 4 to 6 lane highways to accommodate for increased traffic that is slowing everyone down, not just truck drivers. Note that if traffic was flowing faster, there would be less idling and slow moving and therefore, less emissions being pumped into the atmosphere. 

5.  Shippers and receivers that treat truck drivers like machinery.  We are to be there at some appointed time and if we miss that slot, we get put back and wait for hours, even overnight, to get loaded.  Many shippers/receivers have little to no respect for truck drivers. Some of that is deserved with this new generation of ""drivers"" that don't know what professionalism means or common courtesy entails.  We are all treated the same and put into the same boat.  Even when showing up on time, there are hours long waits at many places for a loading slot to back into.  Even longer to actually get the truck loaded once the truck is backed into a loading dock.  

6. Harassment by troopers/state police/LEO's.  We are stopped endlessly, told we are subject to ""implied consent"" and given a hard time about every little thing.  I was written a warning for a strap that had come loose on a fire extinguisher. The trooper said it's ""only a warning"" while full well knowing it affects both the driver and the trucking company he/she is driving for.  Troopers are not our friends, they are people looking at the trucking industry as enemies of the state, hassling us, talking down to us, treating us disrespectfully, going to EXTREME lengths to find ANY thing wrong, even if it has NOTHING TO DO WITH SAFETY.  

There is more, but I suspect it's a waste of time to outline the vast problems in the trucking industry. What will eventually get your attention is the large number of older, highly experienced drivers that have had enough of this nonsense, turning in their keys to their companies or driving their trucks home, hanging up the keys and saying enough. I am starting my own business and will be out of trucking permanently within 2 years.  

Truck drivers are scum, the lowest of the low, wastes of space in the eyes of many public officials in various positions of authority. Many of us are taking early retirement or finding something else to do for income.  Why do you think it's so hard to attract new people to the trucking industry?  Why do you think such a large percentage of new drivers quit within their first year?  Y'all don't care, that's what.  You better get those autonomous trucks going soon - very soon - because more and more drivers are going to quit and never look back.  Oh wait, those autonomous trucks will still need drivers.

Your harsh stances against truck drivers and the aftermath of a huge shortage of drivers is all on you. Perhaps if y'all would get yourselves into a truck and spend a few MONTHS in one, you might come to understand the difficulties we face on a daily basis.  ",,,,,,,

Companies that use these impossible delivery times also make it nearly impossible to reschedule delivery and have even made false emergency declarations to try and manipulate drivers, but they cannot break the laws of physics. Both Walmart and Target respond to late loads with extreme retaliation, often forcing the driver to wait DAYS to deliver if they cannot make an impossible appointment.

It typically (pre-COVID) takes 5-6 weeks from when the shipment leaves South Korea to when it gets to our facility in Ohio.  Currently, our FCL shipments are taking an average of 5 months to get here.  There are bottlenecks at every step of the process: we can't get containers in Asia; once we get one reserved, we may not have space on a ship.  The travel across the Pacific seems to take the same amount of time it always has, but once the boat gets to the West Coast -- typically the Port of Seattle in our case -- the ship sits in the harbor for up to a month.  Once our container is actually unloaded, then it languishes in a pile of other containers for another two months, waiting for space on the rail to bring it across the country.  In a couple of cases, they lost our container for a few weeks in the jumble of imports. Once it finally gets to a rail car, the shipment stops at various locations across the US.   As I understand it, we have to change from one train company to another as it makes its way East. At each of these points, the container has to wait.  Once it finally arrives in Detroit, MI (the closest hub for us), it usually gets here relatively quickly -- within 5-7 days.  This has been happening since about February of 2021.  These glitches don't seem to be anything other than a lack of workers and equipment at each port or waystation. 
In addition, our shipping costs have gone up by nearly 500%.  While I understand that our provider has to raise prices to account for the extra time the ships are in the harbor, 500% seems egregious and like price gouging.  But we have no recourse.  We have looked into other providers, and they tell us they cannot get our shipments any quicker or for a lower price. 
We are lucky that we have understanding clients dealing with this issue from nearly every supplier, but they are not going to pay us until they have their products.  As a result, we have sent people home for weeks at a time. We want to hire more people, as our demand for our products is very high, but we don't feel that we can with all of the uncertainty.
It should be worth noting that our July and August shipments must be split up and sent LCL in 4-5 different shipments, but our shipping provider cannot find space for those, either.  
Our most significant concern is when we will not get our shipments and therefore have very little income. We don't want to lay people off, and we don't want to close our doors.  Our business is healthy, otherwise.",,,,,,,

Without accurate PNT, the transportation industry would be brought to its knees.   Yet there is general reluctance to provide any backup system.  Occasionally we might hear a politician or bureaucrat mention it, but that is as far as it goes, and it gets swept under the rug AGAIN.

There is NO backup system.  GPS is extremely vulnerable.  Signals from a satellite are extremely weak and easy to jam or spoof.  Public literature is filled with examples. If GPS goes down, the industry goes down.  Military folks tell us that this is the first thing an enemy would target in a war.   Yet we do NOTHING.

I would recommend the following:

1. Re-establish e-LORAN under Coast Guard control.  It's a very low frequency system that can provide some PNT as a backup.   It replaces LORAN that worked for decades until one of your bureaucrats slashed its budget.
2. Develop redundant fiber-optic networks throughout the country that distribute accurate Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) to subscriber centers.   Correct for distance latency.
3. Allow free ""listen only"" services to subscribers.  Examples from the 1950's include Radio Station WWV (look it up).
4. Back these up with low-earth PNT satellites.",,,,,,,

Appointments required for everything which usually 48 hours + out. You can't make appointments if gate fee or other fees not cleared by SSL or customer yet which slows process, then when is available to schedule there are no appts available. lines are so long that by time drivers get to gate to get in - you can be minutes past appt time due to those lines and told you have to reschedule; another 48 hours+ for another appt!

Then you have the rails that are only allocating so many each day allowed in. If you say have 50 to go to SLC and the allocations are 9 for the day either the container will sit at port until there are enough allocations available for a day or truckers must bring to an outside yard and store at the expense of customers/lines etc. for availability at rails.

My organization is a non-US entity so I will be brief. 

I am commenting on behalf of the Royal Institute of Navigation, of which I am Director (CEO). The Institute's objective is to share knowledge and understanding in relation to positioning, navigation and timing. The Institute has been established for almost 75 years and has world-recognised deep expertise and experience.

 
I would like to wholeheartedly support the comments made by the Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation on this matter. The UK Government has recently undertaken a detailed review of the resilience of positioning, navigation and timing systems. The stark reality is that all critical infrastructure would be affected by a loss of satellite navigation systems. A UK report from 2017/8 found a £1 billion / day impact from the loss of satellite navigation systems. The major areas impacted were logistics. Many at-risk sectors remain exposed. In fact, many have become more exposed due to either more adoption and/or due to increased prevalence and severity of cyber risks such as jamming and spoofing. (Reference @ note 1 below.) 

There is evidence that China, Russia and others have invested in complementary and/or back-up systems to reduce their reliance on satellite navigation signals. The UK strategy, to be published soon, recommends a layered approach to improve performance, combining multiple diverse positioning systems for resilience. These systems should not all be space-based. 

In short: your friends in the UK recognize the challenges and are similarly actively engaged in investigating resilient solutions. 

Please contact me directly if I you have questions.

Sincerely, John Pottle

Trucks are offloaded with a service called a lumper; it is the people taking the product off the back of the truck. Most warehouses have another company come in and offer these services; likely due to infrastructure issues in the warehouse where they don't either have the assets or the manpower to handle the offloading themselves. More times than not, these services are paid for by the driver to get the product off. I would say probably 5 to 10 percent of the time the offloading is prepaid or there is no charge. 

Here is what happens. The driver will call either their company/dispatcher, (depending upon the company) broker, or contracted customer to receive a money code to pay for the lumper service. In our companies instance, we use EFS or T-chek codes to give the drivers money codes. These services charge us a fee for the use and that fee is passed along to the driver. 

The driver then gets a receipt and has to get it to their dispatcher, broker, or contracted customer within a certain amount of time to get reimbursed; most of the times it 24 to 48 hours or the driver has to eat the cost. When reimbursed, it gets added to the load's rate and paid out to the driver with the broker/customer's accounts payable. The broker/customer than has to bill the receiving company for it; either outright for the amount or in their product costs. 

This system is highly inefficient. 

Firstly, it creates the trickle down effect with cash; the mapping out of it would be massive if put on a flow chart. The lumper company makes money off the driver and they are probably receiving commission from the warehouse for being on site. The money code companies are making money off the driver. The broker/customer are recharging the lumper charge to the receiver. In the end those costs get added to product costs which the average joe/shopper pays for when purchasing the goods/services for final consumption. In other words, it raises prices which in turn affects buying power and standards of living. In a way, it is a successful Ponzi scheme.  

Secondly, it adds work to the all involved parties. Driver has added work of getting receipt off sometimes separately from other paperwork. Their company has added work to send paperwork off to the broker/customer and enter it in their system for billing. The broker/customer has to verify the receipt and add/approve it to the rate; they usually send over a new rate sheet which the driver's company has to sign and send back. The driver's company has to bill for additional amount and provide paperwork again. Then from their the broker/customer has to add it back to their billing and/or pricing. This is time that could be used for other tasks such as dispatching other drivers or booking more loads. 

Lastly, it takes money out of driver's pocket in two ways. They don't get reimbursed for money codes; theses can be 5 dollars or more a time easily. Then driver's have to wait for their reimbursement. Pay from their company, brokers, or contracted clients are not same day; standard business practice is net 30 days after receiving all the delivery paperwork. If it is ran through the driver's company, then the driver gets paid but the company has to wait until paid. 

The economics of this just doesn't make sense and ultimately the ones most impacted are the consumers. ",,,,,,,

We are the Railroad District of International Association of Machinists and represent all Locomotive and Track Equipment Mechanical Employees of all the Class One and Short Line Railroads.  We hold the position that the Class One Railroads is the center of the America's Supply Chain backlog.  CSX began the wave of the Precision Railroad operating model, which most of the Class One Railroads have followed and implemented.  What it meant to the our Mechanical Members was massive furloughs.  These furloughs were not triggered by lack of work or equipment.  It was triggered solely to reduce the Railroads operating ratio.  Lowering operation ratios increases profit and benefits stock holders. Railroads used their increased profits to buy back billions of dollars of stock.  What it meant to Shippers is that Shippers were not able to ship their products by rail and the Rail Carriers didn't care.   The Shippers complaints to the Surface Transportation Board fell on deaf of ears of the past Administration.  Railroads wouldn't haul unless it resulted in high profits, Shippers couldn't ship and that is what brings the US to the place the America's supply Chain is in today.  From the Mechanical side, The Railroads increased train lengths from mile long trains to 3-5 mile long trains.  Increased train lengths resulted in less Locomotive power to pull trains.  Less locomotives resulted in massive furloughs of the locomotive mechanics.  Railroad Management treated Railroad workers with disrespect.  They mandated unreasonable man hours including minatory unreasonable amounts of overtime.  Often requiring Locomotive to work Mechanics consecutive 16 hour work days.  Refused to let Mechanics go home even after their normal shift ended.  Many longtime Railroad employees have and are still walking off the job because of the way they are being treated by the Railroads.  In one instance, Norfolk Southern went as far as ordering a single father with young children to work his 4th 16 hour day in a row or quit.  He quit.   The Railroads are now putting stored locomotives back in service but lack the Mechanical Manpower to meet the demand. They are recalling Locomotive Mechanics, however Railroaders will not come back to work.  Even the longtime Railroaders.  Many have been recalled, came back to work for a few weeks or months and furloughed again.  It is understandable, especially for past Railroad workers, why they won't come back to what use to be the best job in the country. There is no job security and it is no longer the  best jobs in the country, in fact it is one of , if not the worst job in the country.   The Railroads have caused the supply chain deficiencies and are solely responsible.  Many times it is best if our government does not get involved.  However, in this case, the government must get involved.  If the government doesn't get involved, the Rails will come crashing down and we will be left with a failed rail system all across the US.

Needs to be a maximum limit on detention. Adequate truck parking for DOT mandated breaks is a major shortage. On/off ramps are already in place and parking should be allowed there in all states. The 10 sleeper berth rule is unsafe in practice. No one is rested after 10 hours in a moving truck to then drive 500 miles. I personally would like to see a rule change so the truck cannot be moving. Drivers talk alot about being fatigued due to not sleeping while in the berth. The 8 hour break rule is inefficient. I think as long as a driver takes a 30 minute break within his 11 hour driving time thst is sufficient. Many times its just over 8 hours to a location. S driver has to stop for 30 minutes and may only be a half hour away from destination. Now he may be detained at location upon arrival because the customer is not ready. He could take his break the. I think new drivers leave because the HOS rules are confusing and do not facilitate efficiency in the movement of freight. Finally driver training and support is absolutely pathetic across the board with companies. CDL schools teach you how to pass a test. Do not teach you to drive a truck and be a professional driver. Allowing individuals to take their CDL test without going to a school is a great idea. Its a waste of their time. Lots of kids already have experience and skills to pass the test. Now once licensed, I believe drivers should have to be re-certified maybe every 5 years or so. There needs to be an ongoing training in driving skills, new technologies at the employer level. New drivers feel like they are thrown out on road because a company just needs drivers. Leads to frustration and turnover. I think pilots must re-certify every so often and I believe that is a good idea for truck drivers. As long as they are now paid better because more is being asked of them. If these issues were addressed I think much if the driver shortage and retention issues would be resolved. Adequate pay with actual support and training from employers, trucks not sitting idle waiting with no recourse or detention pay, preventing brokers from holding payment for delivered loads for weeks after accepting the load, and treating tuck driving like a profession and getting rules out of the way of impeding a drivers success by making him tired and unsafe. The HOS rules are a joke. That’s why there are so many violations. Its the rules themselves. Drivers leave and freight is delayed because of them. They need to be streamlined. Enable drivers to be rested and get to the customer without having to stop. I deal with the 30 minute break rule every day. It is frustrating. I have to stop 20 minutes away, everyday, from my customer. Then I am there another 30 minutes dropping my load and picking up another. Shouldn’t have to take that break on route to location.

Seems one of the bottlenecks creating disruptions in the supply chain is both California and this administrations itself. This support of both AB5 and the PRO-Act kills the small buisness the supply chain depends on to actually work. You need trucks to move the vast majority of freight, but write laws limiting the drivers ability to do that, and then put them out of business. Seems that's counter-productive to a smooth supply chain operation.",,,,,,,

The rule is antiquated now that we are on e-logs. We should be allowed to drive 11, work 14 every day we want to work away from home. Also require all “major” shippers and receiver allow access to ample parking, bathroom facilities, and lighting to provide drivers with safe places to service the customers needs as well as support safety by being allowed to utilize such facilities. Parking,parking,parking,parking. I cannot say this enough. Unless the infrastructure is in place to accommodate more trucks putting more on the highway will only logjam what is already available. The warehouses we go to are already overbooked, that is why drivers have to wait so much there. Get us in and out of shippers and receivers docks and shelves will fill up faster. Again these are all issues of concern for me as a professional truck driver. The biggest is the 70 hour rule. It only allows us to work 8.75 hours per day average. If this rule is not addressed then adding trucks and drivers to an already stressed system will only create more stress and turnover in the industry. We are 99% all on elogs now so lets get some modern rule to go with our modern regulatory equipment and our comfortable trucks. Let us drive 11 work 14 and break for 10 to earn a better living, provide better service to the customers, and ease our stress in a major way. Thanks. ",,,,,,,

Since 2012, I have found myself dealing with increasing levels of frustration with this industry.
You, the Federal Government, in your infinite IGNORANCE have swooped in ""To help us"", and made a WORSE mess of the mess YOU HAVE MADE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
My number one gripe? ELECTRONIC LOGS.
Either standardize them, or (preferably), ELIMINATE THEM.
Barring that, (and my second pet peeve), the USELESS mandatory 30 minute break. (What MORON up with THIS brilliant concept?)
Congratulations, you've created THOUSANDS of little bottlenecks NATIONWIDE! Why? Because at virtually EVERY truck stop fuel island, you get these IDIOTS parking for their mandatory break, and if they try to move, even a few feet, the stupid E-log resets to driving mode, and their break is toast. This is a MASSIVE waste of room, time, and causes tempers to flare all the time, everywhere.
Detention. 
NOTHING is as frustrating as a customer wasting our time. Imagine sitting there in a dock door for 12 hours, losing money...
I dont make as much money sitting as I do driving, and others don't get paid for that time at all.
Do you work for free? I don't.
If customers want their freight to ship, maybe they ought to have the freight ON the dock, lined up at the door, at the truck's appointment time.
And if the receiver wants it broken down a certain way, then either they should have it shipped that way, or bring their lumpers under their corporate umbrellas, and quit wasting our time sitting there waiting for their guys to count the freight in, or pay us a rate commensurate with what we make, going down the road, at speed.
Parking.
No matter WHAT ANYONE TELLS YOU, parking is a MASSIVE problem! After dark, there virtually IS none.
This is especially true in and around and close to major metrpolitan areas, western Washington, the greater northeastern states, all across the southeast, and southern California are the worst examples.
There are also vast areas along the interstates, and some federal highways where there is literally nowhere to park, for very long distances, and those places that exist, fill up fast. If this isn't indicative of a parking shortage, I fail to see what is.
This is where my military experience comes in.
The Eisenhower Interstate system was designed as President Eisenhower, then a General in the Army, led our forces to defeat Nazi Germany.
We based the Interstate system upon the German Autobahn (motorway). While stationed in West Germany between 1988, and 1990, I travelled that system a time or two. I especially liked the rest areas that featured plenty of parking, and food. 
Two states I credit here are Indiana, and Ohio. Their turnpikes, and the service areas they have, provide (mostly) ample parking, and (for the most part), a driver like me (who primarily operates by night), can find a spot to park, and grab a hot bite, almost any time.
Lastly, but certainly not least, is this idiotic fascination with slow trucks, 3rd lane laws, and not enforcing English as the official language of this industry. 
What good is a speed limit on any road, if no one can attain it? Slow trucks, at governed speeds like 65, clog up the roads all day, every day, everywhere. This mess only exacerbates both road rage, and congestion, and causes more accidents than it prevents.
Don't rely on statistics, get out of that office, and ask some of us older, more experienced drivers who live on the interstates instead. I suggest taking a drive south out of DC at any given time along 95, and you'll see the mess. It's a waste. I suggest tying the speed of a truck to the level of skill and safety record of the person at the wheel, up to the highest speed limit in the country along the interstate system. Which leads me to my last point.
English. Do you speak it? I do.
Go on, call me a racist, if it comforts you. Done? Good. Now that I've upset you, let's examine the rules to hold a CDL, shall we?
Oh, look! One of the MAIN requirements is the CDL holder be able to read and speak the English language.
WE DON'T USE INTERNANIONAL ROAD SIGNAGE HERE!
Look it up. There's a HUGE difference in American signage, and international road signs.
The majority of our signage is in English, and those who aren't proficient represent the majority of large crashes nationally, annually. I dare you to look up those statistics.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Loads with appointment times can be accompanied by bonuses for on time deliveries. Transportation is the most volatile aspect of logistics. Shippers and receivers should be held accountable with heavy minimum detention fees. Long loading times is the biggest cause for missed loads, which can lead to thousands in lost revenue for a single lost load.

The other issue and probably more important, is truck parking. There are thousands of open spaces available to park which are arbitrarily off limits to trucks. Many of these lots are camera monitored or patrolled by security personnel and can easily implement systems of fines for trucks who leave behind waste or damage. Simply prohibiting trucks from parking in accessible lots contributes to problems in the industry rather than solving anything. ",,,,,,,

We usually ship LCL shipments through a co-loader.  First the vessels sit at anchor in the Long Beach Harbor for several days even weeks.   We just had a vessel arrive Sep 29 that was supposed to Berth on Oct 13 and has now been delayed to Oct. 23. 
Once our cargo gets unloaded at the steamship terminal, it waits for weeks to get loaded on the rail to Atlanta.  (final destination is Huntsville, AL)   I had contacted the Port of Long Beach about these delays awhile back and they said they are just the landlord of the property and have no say in what gets moved.    As a small manufacturing company, we have no clout or influence like major importers to get anything moved out of the port.  All we can do is wait and wait and wait.  
We thought loading our own 40’ containers would help, but we had two containers sit in Long Beach for 3 months and were told there just wasn’t any allocation on the rail to move containers to Huntsville.  
Is it possible that we need to allow more immigration to fill jobs at the ports, rail, warehouses, and trucklines to help alleviate the congestion.   With so many people out of work due to Covid, there is a huge gap in available workers that could be filled with immigrants.   
The supply chain congestion is killing our business.  And we are an American manufacturer trying to create jobs for Americans.    We appreciate anything you can do to get containers moving!

In my opinion, the supply chain issue that the United States is facing is caused by a shortage of drivers. I feel that the shortage of drivers can improved through a combination of multiple things. First off, start at the beginning, with the education system. Education institutions do not make students aware of the trucking industry and the earnings potential. Instead, they encourage students to attend four year continued education institutions and a lifetime of debt. Those students that do choose to go to a four year continued education institution often do not earn as much as a truck driver, and a truck driver doesn’t start his/her career in debt. 
Second, I feel that the trucking industry needs to make the industry more appealing. This can be done by paying drivers a fair livable income. Starting a driver at twenty-eight cents per mile is not a fair and livable income. Trucking companies can also make less expensive health benefits available to drivers and offer things like paid holidays available. 
Lastly, I believe that the US Government could make more of an effort to ensure that drivers have parking available to rest when necessary. Far too many rest areas in the nation are closed due to the inability to fund the facility. Drivers are also struggling to find simple amenities such as food and restrooms. Since the pandemic began, many travel centers have closed their restaurants due to lack of staff or because the Covid restrictions set forth by the government have made it not feasible to operate. The US Government can also ease regulations such as the hours of service, medical requirements, or restricting drivers under twenty-one to one state. No two people are the same. An individual knows when he/she is tired and how much sleep he/she needs. Only issuing a driver a six month or one year medical card because he/she is being treated for something like high blood pressure, diabetes, or sleep apnea is unnecessary. I drive for a mega-carrier and they monitor my sleep apnea on a regular basis but I can only get a one year medical card. Not only is it burdensome to have to find and get to a medical examiner on such a frequent basis, it’s financially costly as the exams are not free. A driver that can drive across the state of Texas or down the state of California are no less capable of crossing a state line in a commercial truck as he/she is to travel the great distances in the large states. Like myself, many of them started driving at a very young age on the family farm. I was just nine years old when I took my first load from the farm to the elevator in a commercial tractor-trailer. Thirty-one years later, I’ve still never had an accident. 
In conclusion, the supply chain issues can be resolved if the education institutions, the trucking company as a whole, and the US Government works together. ",,,,,,,

I'm sure you have heard a lot of the comments by now. I have been in the trucking profession starting in 1980's. And what is happening today is caused by low rates, high fuel and insurance prices. Waiting time to pickup and deliver. Brokers taking to much from the trucker. Federal regulations, drug testing. Every State has different laws for trucks. Always getting tickets for parking in zones that have no signs to warn the driver. Federal government should step in to make all States have the same laws give truckers a safe place to park over night. 
Some drivers are paid by the hour this is mostly local drivers that work Monday to Friday 8-10 hours a day. Now the over the road truckers most of them get paid by the mile. So any delay in loading or unloading the driver most of the time gets nothing. This has to be fixed. No driver should work for free. Would any one reading this work for free? What I think needs to be done now is to relax some Hours Of Service rules just like when FEMA needs help in an emergency..
To enter a Port to pickup a container the driver needs a federal TWIC Card. There are lots of trucking company's that don't mess with this process. the cost to get one driver pays that. The container yard can either escort the drivers in or relax the rule for now to get more trucking company's in the ports to pickup the containers to deliver them quickly. Offer a better rate to move them within so many hours. Have business be open at night and weekends for delivery's. 
Have Ports open 24/7 for trucking can be around the clock. Just like any job in the U.S. if you pay the person a good wage they will be happy and work with no problem. When a company takes advantage of a driver and pays them low wages that is when drivers move around from different company's and the chain will slow there also. This country does not value the truck driver until all hell breaks loose like now. If the government would treat us like were needed maybe there would not be a driver shortage.",,,,,,,

Truck drivers will take breaks when they need to or wish to. 
Mandating a 30 minute break in theory is a good idea, however in practice this results in drivers being forced to find parking where there often is none. This leads to drivers taking said break in the fuel islands of truck stops. Which in turn slows down and delays everyone needing to fuel, scale, use the bathroom etc. 
But most of all this requirement just makes our days 30 minutes longer. Which if your concerned about drivers being awake and alert this rule is not beneficial. Making our already long days longer through a mandate like this one is counter productive.

There’s an estimated 3.5 million truck drivers in the United States but there is a truck driver shortage. Why? 
Next generations don’t want to work for someone. They rather hustle to get ahead. Example: door dash, Uber, Lyft, etc. 
After CDL school and $150,000 truck, which is a great investment for a person, the freedom of trade is limited once a person signs up with a broker. 
Company drivers want detention pay or hourly pay.  Independent drive need transparency in the industry and elimination of solicitation clauses. 
For example: New independent drivers use brokers to find loads. Shipper pays $4000 to the broker and the broker pays $1000 to the driver. The industry needs regulation to become transparent meaning the shipper, broker, and driver all know what each other is paying and making. 
Brokers also include a solicitation clause. Drivers can’t transport loads for the shipper once they have used the broker. Clauses such as this promote dishonesty while restricting freedom of trade. ( California has laws prohibiting such clauses) 
Brokers are needed when shippers have more loads than truck/drivers. They should not be allowed to prevent shippers / drivers from continuing business without the broker, especially trustworthy drivers.

Two small changes could allow increase income for drivers, increase the flow of goods, and allow the market to provide an honest transportation cost. 

I hope this provides help and would gladly elaborate if needed. ",,,,,,,

In response to the Department of Transportation’s request for information addressing “current and future challenges to supply chain resilience in the freight and logistics sector” and given the context of the Executive Order on America’s supply chains, I respectfully submit for consideration the attached working paper, while focused on the supply of critical minerals and other materials, is relevant to the Department’s jurisdiction, not least because of the importance of these inputs to the development of electric vehicles and other climate change mitigating modes of transport, both for their manufacture and for their operation.

As policymakers continue to craft plans for securing America’s supply chains, many have focused on reshoring, the process of bringing back home the sourcing of certain materials, rather than depending on foreign imports. This idea is fundamentally flawed given not only geology, but also today’s inter-connected market dynamics as well as politics. It is important for policymakers to understand that most supply chains, like critical materials, simply will not fit into this model, even if it polls well. Rather policymakers and public officials should bear in mind the following points (which are detailed in the attached paper):

•	Critical Minerals Are Today Mostly Imported to the U.S. 

•	For Most Critical Minerals and Materials, Reshoring is Not an Option 

•	Securing the Supply Chain for Critical Minerals is Essential to Meeting U.S. Climate Goals 

•	Creating a Strategic Reserve Can Help Ensure Critical Materials Are Available When Needed 

•	Creating More Market Interdependence, Not Less, Helps Avoid Market Hold Up 

•	Securing Critical Minerals May Very Well Mean Going Beyond Circle of Political Allies 

•	Publicly Traded Multinationals with Diverse Supply Chains Can Also Offer Solutions 

•	Securing the Supply Chain for Critical Minerals Will Take a Variety of Approaches 

In short, to secure its strategic interests as well as to achieve national goals like transforming to a greener economy while assuring resilient transport and other supply chains, the United States will need to rethink how risk is managed up and down far-flung, inter-connected that provide key material inputs.

Compared to 20 years ago (I've been in this business over 30 years), we: 1. aren't working smart or with the goal in mind (we are mostly bound by many procedures that conflict, that depend upon a serial path, that have little or no redundancy, that have a purpose very seldom but are always in place.  If we continue to work like this, we cannot build enough facilities, buy enough equipment, or hire enough people, because we are squandering our resources and many workers simply put their time in and aren't looking toward the goal.  
ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS: 1. procedures and processes that are barriers to productivity.   2. We can't build or buy our way out of this; the lawyers and the agencies pile on steps of unneeded things to do.  3.   Warehouses are fine but they work without much regard to actually moving trucks in many cases.  4.  Risks to resilience is short-sided and one-sided policies where companies and ports, warehouses, etc.  look out for the transaction and not the relationship.  5. Overreaction to 'climate change' has created thousands of broke down new trucks - we sit in shops waiting for parts and repairs to emissions systems - this has been going on for years.  6. We just need people to work toward a goal, and use the systems to support them.  We hear from our port that they are ""too systems dependent"" to go to manual processes when the computers or connectivity go down.   This means that the port stops because of computer outages.  7. Workforce - they simply need critical thinking, to be on the job and not at home for whatever marginal reason, and driving toward the goal.  This country was built on people going to work, and getting a job done.  We've lost much of that drive in this industry.  8. There are so many barriers to supply chain performance - lack of financial incentive for piecework/productivity; incentives to law enforcement to find obscure equipment malfunctions, ""Earliest Receiving Date"" at the ports (kind of a new barrier); irrational HOS from FMCSA/ Congress; lane restrictions; truck routes that defy logic and add miles and concentrate trucks onto a few roads (same for haz mat - all haz mat is not the same!); and more.  9. We need to use our brains, experience, and common sense to utilize what we have.  10. The reliance on systems, processes, have slowed down every step of imports and exports.  We often take a day or two to get an answer to a barrier to moving a load, when we used to call someone and have an answer in minutes.  We sometimes do an entire round trip run without getting loaded (or unloaded) because of data changes by one of the many parties - this did not ever happen in the past.  Automation isn't working.  11. The regs need to be suspended or repealed in many cases to allow processes to operate.  We hear that everything from DHS to USC slow down all of these steps.  12. Regulators aren't going to fix this with any sort of consultative role, or with more regulations.  Somehow we've ended up with thousands of regs to follow, and someone is asking why loads aren't moving quickly.  Here's one issue - gov't requires CPAP machines and yet they are hard to get parts for. 
 The poorly-functioning medical requirement verification for CMV drivers doesn't always get entered in the state DMV system and a paper card isn't accepted; and so on.  These are drivers sitting instead of hauling loads.  The reason for the immediate backlog is simple imbalance; it's too many people showing up at the pizza place and the oven is full, and the check-out line is long, and now they're out of pepperoni.  You can't build another pizza place for this rush - you have to optimize what you have and also use prioritization so that the right things are happening.  Throwing money at it isn't the answer.  13. Same as 12.  Every gov't reg has the potential to slow things down and create extra work in every case, even though perhaps only needed in a case now and then.  Thankfully the written DVIR process was overturned, that was one example of counterproductive work that didn't create a benefit except to unfairly reinforce the wrong perception of industry conditions.  
Further note: longer hours are the port are not able to be utilized unless the supporting facilities are also open, and all open facilities need to be staffed with decision makers, including exporters and importers.  We have tried this over the years, and if there is a barrier to moving forward and if there is no decision maker then not only is there no work accomplished but also there is wasted work, fuel, and such.  WE ENCOUNTER MORE PROBLEM ORDERS THAN SMOOTH ORDERS MOST WEEKS FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS.  ",,,,,,,

3.Reinstate what the interstate was originally used for miltary,semis and emergency traffic only
4.Make a trucker safe parking  law
a.Make it illegal for anyone to charge truckers to park
b.Allow us to park anywhere anytime wherever there is adequate parking - all businesses should not have the right to ban truck parking heavily fine them if they do 
5.Rollback the FMSCA and do away with alot of the ridiculous rules
6.Make a transportation minimum wage all drivers should at least be making 2500.00$ or more a week and exempt us from all tax burdens 
I can guarantee if these items are met alot of issues will stop

Some of the challenges I hear and see include, crappy roads that cause expensive repairs to the truck, the elog which doesn't take into account that fact that during his available drive time he spends hours waiting to have his loads unloaded and loaded.  He has to sit sometimes for 5 hours waiting for the load after driving 5 hours to stop off and then he is out of log time because the 5 hours of waiting is on duty and counts or the time he spends in traffic jams waiting on accidents. He was stuck in TN for an accident that closed the highway for 6 hours and then didn't have log time left. Truck stops with no parking or that charge for parking, have no laundry facilities.  He lives 90% of the time on the road and waiting in traffic, waiting for loads missing birthdays, holidays and time to deliver crap.  Each state has different regs for speed and rules for truckers. Then he gets to scales and some are nice and some are power hungry.  Its a thankless job where he gets cut off in traffic, the roads suck in some states so they tear up the truck with costly repairs and when he stops at a truck stop he may or may not find a place to park, have to pay extra to park overnight,  shower, wash his clothes in the shower because there is no laundry, food places are closed or out of food and the parking lots smell like pee.  You want truckers who will do a job dont hamstring them with over regulations,  make it possible for the small owner operators to find health insurance,  ensure enough parking so when they are forced to stop there is actually a place to stop and repair the roads.  He drives 3000 miles a week on average and loading and unloading,  paying extra for scales, lumpers, permits to drive through states, fuel and the $20 a night to park in a truck stop after spending  600 on fuel, $12 for a scales and $10 to take a shower or 300 for a retread tire and 500 for an oil change for maybe if he's lucky he can bring home 800 a week and this doesn't include insurance,  dot authority etc just to put a truck on the road.

There needs to be federally mandated detention rules that get assessed for warehouses keeping drivers on location for extended periods of time. 
In terms of unloading and where locations utilize lumpers, drivers should be allowed to unload their trucks at the same rate that the lumper service charges. Those two actions alone would solve trucks from being delayed longer they need to be and keep them moving onto the next load. 
In terms of HOS, instead of capping drive hours, change the approach in terms of mandating Sleeper Birth hours. Meaning don't cap daily drive hours unless sufficient rest time is completed. By monitoring SB rules instead of capping drive hours, that would free up truck capacity as well. 
Example; if a driver has 10 hours of consecutive in SB. Allow drivers to drive 14 hours. For every extra hr of SB, allow for an extra hr of drive time and so on. 
Calculate and track rest. Since HOS is to track rest anyway. ",,,,,,,

At one time it was a given that one we were at a shipper or receiver that would would usually have a2 hour wait to be loaded or unloaded. Now if we show up early we are either fined or turned away. The same thing for arriving late.  If we arrive on time, it's nothing for us to sit longer than 2 hours. This is time that eats into the federally regulations hours of service. We are denied access to restrooms, water, and are treated worse than a kicked dog. While waiting, if we run out of our legal workable hours, we are usually kicked off property, threatened with calling the police, or having our vehicles towed and impounded. Or we have to illegally drive to hopefully find a safe place to park to get our required rest. 
By mandating a strick 2 hour unload or pay ruling, shippers and receivers will stay ensuring that truckers are in and out quicker. This will allow us to get more freight moving. ",,,,,,,

Owner operators like myself are at a nerve racking struggle to maintain helping our nation's transportation needs. Ofcourse, the fuel cost is our highest expense, that itself needs immediate attention to bring fuel cost down.  Load brokers often try to get truck owners to take cheap freight and also take alot more than fair of their percentage cut. Brokers should be regulated to only take up to 15% of shipping cost, 90% of the shipping cost is on the trucking company itself, not the broker.  Equitment cost has always been expensive,  even more so in the crisis we are in currently.  Its nearly impossible for Owner operators to to purchase good used or new equipment, many owner operators are shutting their doors simply because it is no longer affordable to keep the doors open.  Banks and financial lenders raise the qualifying bar so high, that the average buisness owner would not qualify to purchase needed equipment. We need to put something in place or regulate bank policies in order to give the average buisness owner a fair chance to succeed and grow.  If the buisness grows, this means more jobs for our hard working citizens.  DOT regulations could use some changes, especially the h.o.s..  Our h.o.s. is so regulated that the shipments have had issues being delivered late to the customers.  At the minimum,  we should go back to the 8/10/70 - 24 restart rules rather than what we currently have or do away of logs all together.  Drivers know when they are tired and need rest, not a computer.  It would definitely help to build much bigger rest areas for more parking, and mandate truckstops from charging drivers to park overnight in order to get their rest, these fees can go up to $30 per night for parking.  We need more truck stops near metropolitan areas all across the country. We could use more truck bypasses going around major cities separate from local traffic.  Some states have a serious lack of maintenance to their roadways which needs immediate attention.  Unmaintanced roadways cost truck owners more repair cost yearly and its getting worse every year.  As a buisness owner and owner operator,  I struggle to keep my buisness open and provide the transportation needs of our nation.  My goal is to build my buisness to a fair size trucking company and provide white glove service to my customers.   This would provide more jobs in the industry from office jobs to drivers & mechanics.  I spend from 3 weeks to 2 months away from home & family just to stay afloat with one truck & trailer.  If the overhead cost continues to increase in the trucking industry, either pay per load needs to increase to a fair price or close my doors, Im not one to give up without a fight.  I will fight to keep my doors open until im forced to close my buisness.  I sincerely hope the government will look into these issues and make some serious changes in the transportation industry so we can increase more drivers and jobs for our nation.      Thank You.

And insurance cost for new company is crazy expensive! Next problem is Roads and how crappy dot repair it which makes it worst. Next is you don't have enough CDL drivers which honestly CDL shouldn't be required to operate semi. Because lot of people class A license even with school are a Hazzard. Cdl class A wasn't needed until 92. But at least make non cdl Class C license .allow to transport same weight as class B because honestly it's the same as class C.

The other issue, brokers. Brokers have been lying on rates for quite a bit, but now they lie about weight, apointment times and loaded miles. An institution must be created to oversee their ways of operations, the same way we    (truckers) have FMCSA, DOT, etc

6. Technology issues, including information systems, cybersecurity risks, and interoperability, that affect the safe, efficient, and reliable movement of goods. Would greater standardization of those technologies help address those challenges?
 
ORBCOMM has partnered with civilian and government entities that prioritize leading-edge in-transit visibility solutions utilizing ubiquitous cellular and satellite connectivity.  This technology provides a clear picture for logistics lines of effort affecting the lives of American and Partner Nation Citizens.  Now, more than ever, we must improve multi-enterprise interoperability to deliver limited goods on time and on target. We can positively affect operational priorities such as employee safety, supply chain automation, route optimization and much more by standardizing RFID tracking technology.  Whether it be road, rail or sea, the modernization of in-transit visibility will continue to play a crucial role in the logistics professional’s (or Department of Transportation’s) ability to address the ever-changing availability of goods that sustain everyday life.
 
Entities such as ORBCOMM provide industry complete and integrated fleet monitoring solutions for transportation and logistics, enabling real-time visibility and control of transport assets as they move across the supply chain. The result is improved operational efficiency, increased profitability, safety, and compliance. From trucks, trailers and reefers to intermodal containers or railcars, leading edge fleet telematics technology allows customers the ability to manage any asset from a single, easy-to-use platform. 
 
Recent global events leading to container shortages, port congestion and vessel delays continue to disrupt supply chains, highlighting the need for IoT-enabled visibility into real-time location and status of container equipment and shipments. The emergence of integrated, multi-asset visibility platforms would allow customers to keep a close eye on not just containers, but also railcars, trucks, chassis, gensets, power packs and more. These recent advancements in data interoperability and analytics provide customer the ability to better manage capacity, complexity, compliance, and cost.  Multi-asset oversight is key to maximizing equipment utilization, supply chain information flow and delivery performance.

Tracking and monitoring technology for the transportation industry is available from many different providers and is not something unique to a particular company; however, there is lack of standardization and incentives for companies that transport goods to take full advantage of its capabilities which ultimately benefits the public that depend on the industry’s efficient operation.  Regulations and standards exist for the driver safety in the form of DOT’s FSCMA Electronic Logging Devices (ELD) to accurately monitoring and share a driver’s hours of service (HOS) and the FDA’s Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) to keep foods safe from contamination during transportation; however, tracking and monitoring of containers, trailers and railcars that transport goods do not exist.  Individual companies must see a benefit to their bottom line to implement and the data it produces is retained with a level of confidentiality for their internal operations.  

Recommendation is to create standards and incentives to implement this technology and share data across the transportation supply chain.  This can be in the form of tax incentives, subsidies for participation and/or preferential access to ports/distribution centers, etc.  Adoption of technology will also benefit the transportation companies with more efficient operations which can directly increase driver pay, job satisfaction, attract new workers and ultimately improve the bottom toward growing the economy and keep inflationary transportation costs in check.

Passengers on commuter trains receive no information regarding the hazardous materials transported by the freight trains they'd be sharing the rail with.  The public has a right to know that they could be blown up by explosive cargo such LNG, ethanol, and Bakken crude oil or poisoned from toxic materials including chlorine gas, anhydrous ammonia, and ethyl oxide, all of which are carried via freight trains.  

Additionally, abnormally long (1-mile or more) unit trains carrying extraordinarily heavy, sloshing cargo such as crude oil cause additional and unusual damage to tracks.  Track failure is the leading cause of train derailments, which is another public safety hazard.  Sharing rail corridors also increases public costs since the private rail industry won't be sharing maintenance expenses.  

Last, if this is a Public-Private Partnership - the private rail industry will own the shared rail, not the public, while it will be the rail industry that reaps the RoI.  This is a great deal for the industry, but a public rip off!

Please say no to shared rail.",,,,,,,

Two questions appear to stand out, the financial treatment of transportation upon Interstate Highways, the primary competitor for 200 mile to 1000 mile highway-convertible freight traffic on the General Railway System, and the lack of network performance metrics tied to a certain minimum fixed infrastructure needed to efficiently support domestic industry.

The phones have voicemail that are full. Can not leave a message nor get a payment through fast enough, and therefore must come back the port the next day, wait in line, and then the port charges another day of demerge or dentation.  It is a repeating cycle. We must be able to reasonably conduct business without being held at the mercy of a system that does not allow for speed, nor ethical business operations. Holding goods hostage is not the way to conduct business. Businesses must be able to carry on business without having to do the same task over and over, pay again and again, without getting anything in return.

Thanks for reaching truck drivers specially owners operators to submit comments based on experience and to support our country by being part of the solution in this. 

First thing, based on my experience  the long hours truckers wait to be loaded and/or unloaded is a big issue on the distribution chain. It's a common knowledge that there is a truck driver shortage and having a truck driver waiting several times of a week more than 3 hours to be loaded or unloaded is a big part of the problem. Please note that majority of the time we have an appointment (date/time)  the truck driver arrives on time but the business takes 6, 7, 8 hours to load or unload the driver. I had been waiting up to 2 days stop in a company to be unloaded even when I was there on time. No one looks to understand how this affects the productivity of the driver and the availability of drivers to move loads. This is a very common issue that affects how many drivers are available to move loads and instead of being moving goods drivers are spending big part if the weekly hours loading and unloading. For example if I get 3 loads on a week, I need to load/unload 3 times that week. Then if I wait 6 hours every time, that means I am spending 36 hours of my 70 hours weekly time just loading/unloading, so now I am waiting more than driving. If you multiply this  and make the numbers on how many hours are lost just waiting you will identify how big is the issue. Going to the same example  if we have 300 truckers with the same scenario then the chain of distribution is missing 10,800 hours of a driver availability, that's 648,000 miles that you could have someone moving loads instead of waiting so this is a clear break point of the distribution  chain. Companies doesn't get organized to dispatch drivers on time. I think that maybe a regulation can fix this because then companies need to be accountable in certain way. May be a regulation were the company is obligated to pay extra after having a driving more than 2 or  3 hours waiting as a measure of pressure to let drivers move cargo instead of being stop waiting long hours. At this time there's something called detention but it's not really severe enough as a measure to keep the distribution chain moving since in the reality is that is not something that really happens in the day by day operations, I mean detention is not really paid. 
As a summary, long waiting times for loading/unloading is a big issue that is disruption the distribution. Truck driver shortage is not just we have not drivers but how the drivers we have, are available to move loads instead of being stop waiting.

Re. 	Department of Transportation Docket Number DOT-OST-2021-0106
	America’s Supply Chains and the Transportation Industrial Base

The Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Department of Transportation (DOT) September 16, 2021 Public Notice on “America’s Supply Chains and the Transportation Industrial Base” (DOT-OST-2021-0106).

We recommend that the DOT review the requirements in the IRMA Standard for Responsible Mining when drafting sourcing criteria and promote independent, third-party IRMA audits and related IRMA public reporting requirements to advance responsible mining and public access to information. 

IRMA is a multi-stakeholder coalition founded in 2006 to answer the question “what is responsible mining?” Over a decade, diverse leaders representing directly affected communities, NGOs, organized labor, mining companies, purchasers, and investors crafted the world’s first shared definition of what it means to mine responsibly: the IRMA Standard for Responsible Mining. IRMA is now a global organization managing the standard and the system for independent third-party audits. 

IRMA’s vision is a world where the mining industry respects the human rights and aspirations of affected communities, provides safe, healthy and supportive workplaces, minimizes harm to the environment, and leaves positive legacies.

The transportation sector relies on mined materials. IRMA believes these materials must be responsibly sourced, including materials needed to transition to electric vehicles and a low-carbon transportation sector. The IRMA Standard for Responsible Mining emphasizes comprehensive, detailed coverage of mining issues, and addresses issues of business integrity, social responsibility, environmental responsibility, and planning for positive legacies in 26 chapters and over 400 requirements for responsible mining. Learn more about IRMA and access the IRMA Standard for Responsible Mining at https://responsiblemining.net/ and request more information at info@responsiblemining.net.

Just as transportation and energy decarbonization are inseparable challenges, so are the reshoring of US production, addressing the Urban/Rural divide, and fostering supply chain resilience. 

Characterizing the external costs of freight transportation is a first and essential step to shaping policies that harmonize infrastructure with public interests. [See slidedeck: http://SolutionaryRail.org/slidedeck2021] The US desperately needs to harmonize the interstate highway system with our national interstate railroads for maximum public benefit. Rail deregulation and the lack of serious enforcement of common carrier obligations have allowed monopolistic and extractive railroad business practices. Reasonable, accessible, equitable, and reliable access to rail transport is no longer available to rural communities, small and medium size manufactures, and many shippers deemed ""not profitable enough."" Freight is therefore forced onto trucks, despite plenty of disparate but available evidence that in comparison to heavy trucks, freight rail transport is more energy efficient and less damaging to infrastructure, public safety and other public interest variables. 

Let's make the True Cost of transport transparent and easily available. In 2019, the EU published an External Costs of Freight Handbook [1] to quantify the multiple public benefits of shifting freight from roads to rails, especially electrified rail. The EU has invested in a Shift2Rail[2] program to propose solutions for their freight system. The EU even declared 2021 the “Year of the Train.” 

It is urgent that the US take the public’s interest in rail transport at least as seriously as the EU and others around the globe. The US government needs to marshal its data to demonstrate the public’s interest in transportation investments that maximize benefits, reduce harm, and support investment in supply chains that are resilient and support the vitality of local economies, public health, and the environment. We therefore urge the USDOT to develop an open source External Cost of Freight calculator and corresponding handbook to be used by policy makers, planners and public interest advocates. 

Such an effort could be easily done given the volume of data available, including that  available through the BTS, EPA and STB. Solutionary Rail created a mock up External Cost Calculator in collaboration with Huajing Shi, the Principal Data Scientist of the Port Authority of NY/NJ using formulas from a Kansas DOT Benefit Cost Analysis tool, and FAF 4 data. STB waybill data would be far more accurate than the FAF4. See http://SolutionaryRail.org/extcostcalc

Quantifying the actual costs of our freight transportation choices and setting priorities for a resilient supply chain will serve as a basis for clarifying and updating Common Carrier Obligations of the Class 1 railroads.
The USDOT in collaboration with the STB, FRA and Congress should:
1. Update the national transportation policy to reflect the 21st century public interest in decarbonization, equitable and affordable access, and supply chain resilience.
2. Restore meaning to the concept of Common Carrier based on the public benefits of equitable, accessible, reliable and affordable service that does not discriminate according to volume or distance in ways that undermine the opportunity of smaller or rural shippers and the public to benefit from the efficiencies and harm reduction of rail transport and its role in local, regional, and national supply chains.
3. End the distorting practice of granting commodity and service exemptions and revoke existing exemptions; and
4. Guide the Surface Transportation Board (STB) in expanding both the scope of the rate complaint process to include access to service and the range of parties with standing to include municipalities negatively impacted by inadequate or discriminatory service.

Ultimately, to resolve supply chain issues US infrastructure and our economy must also be harmonized with our values. Supply chain resilience will not be achieved in an economy that relies on human rights violations or environmental degradation offshore. The USDOT can at least account for the public costs of offshoring production such as those incurred by public for operations of port facilities.  A True Cost Calculator or External Cost of Transportation Calculator could be a valuable tool for improving this cause of supply chain disruption.

As a public health physician I vigorously support electried rail, ports and ferries in WA state and across the US. Electric transport supported by a modern robust grid is safer, more reliable, and more efficient than current diesel-reliant trucks, buses, ferries, and trains.The WA Cascade Long-Range Plan for electric rail on current rights-of-way is a climate-change solution hiding in plain sight. Other civilized countries in Europe, Scandinavia, Asia & New Zealand use electric catenary systems for freight and passenger; with precision-timed track use for maximum efficiency. Get freight off diesel trucks onto efficient rail.

Predictable work schedules for transport operators are essential for public safety. Military mishap studies prove that fatigue is as dangerous as drunk driving. Efficient inter-nodal ports and storage yards via modern rail and highway systems are the backbone of predictable work-shift management.

I have a few recommendations. Call me and I can tell you my experience of opening a new factory in the USA. 

1) Remove the FET tax on heavy duty equipment, The tax is now around $2000 per chassis. 
2) Help with tax incentives for manufacturers and equipment purchasers.  
3) Send kids to trade schools instead of college, forget about free college give out free trade school education. It would be cheaper and more worthwhile.  
4) Allow SBA to better assist start up manufacturers even if they are foreign owned if they are directly opening factories in the USA. 

If you would like to learn more about Jansteel USA Inc. and how we are opening a new intermodal chassis factory in Q1 2022 please call or email LCohen@jansteel.com

There is a new MCSAC subcommittee. I’m very upset by the way it was handled when the new administration took over in January, but the drivers on that panel have probably forgotten more than you will ever know.

Don’t just listen to the ATA who only represents the CEOs of their membership. Don’t just listen to OOIDA who has no recent behind the wheel experience.

Reilly International",,,,,,"In response to the President’s request for industry feedback on challenges facing the supply chain now and in the future.  This comment primarily focuses on driver shortages and chassis shortages.   

Our firm is a Licensed Customs Broker and International Freight Forwarder.   We offer our thoughts from the perspective of long-term consideration.  When our thoughts of career and college are shared, they come from the perspective of a young woman without a college degree who started and has run a successful business for 37 years, employing many people with outstanding compensation and benefits.  The kinds of jobs the President would like to create.  

We offer these comments regarding the movement of Intermodal containers, originating or destined for overseas: 

•	The supply chain is a delicate interlinked wheel. (See linked file.)  Everything must keep moving and dwell time should be minimized with each member of the supply chain focusing on this.  
•	Currently, export containers are not being shipped as quickly as this cargo is ready to go. 
•	Many loaded export containers are sitting at the facilities of exporters waiting for shipping lines/railroads to accept them for export.  Majority of US Exports originate in the midwest.   
•	It appears that shipping lines may be more incentivized to ship back empty containers to origin at this time as the freight rates for these containers is much higher than export containers.   
•	The challenge with this, the loaded export containers are sitting on chassis (as you are likely aware there is a severe shortage of chassis in the Midwest of the United States) for weeks waiting for them to be accepted for export bookings.   
•	If a container sits on a chassis for 7 days waiting to be shipped, that chassis can’t be used for anything else.   
•	The US policy of allowing goods to enter this country which are significantly subsidized by the Chinese Government (as Chassis have been) must not happen in the future.  The current dumping and 301 duties should remain, so that major US Chassis manufacturers can supply the US Transportation system.   
•	There is a major shortage of truckers.  

What can be done: 

•	A focus should be placed on getting export loads out of the country.   
•	US Railroads and Shipping lines must be part of this solution.   
•	The US Government could supply tax credits (not just deductions) to trucking companies or container leasing companies operating at ports and Inland Container Depots (Railheads like Chicago) for purchasing and investing in new chassis.  This will allow more organization to participate in hauling containers for international trade.   

o	This will help in two ways; it will encourage investment. 
o	It will fill up the order books of US Chassis manufacturers. 
o	This should be studied as to the need and only offered for a period of time that is necessary.  
•	Do not put Vaccine mandates on truckers, talk to a few, many are near retirement, and they will not respond well to mandates.  I have been around truckers my whole life.   
•	Encourage young people to pursue careers as truckers.  Some truckers at this time are making well over 100K.   Stop signaling to young people that they need a degree.   Help them understand, particularly if they are taking a government loan, what the return on investment minus their loan cost will be.  

•	I saw an interview that truckers need a union, I don’t think time should be spent on that right now, they are in demand, they know it and they are being paid very well.  That is not likely to change.   They are professionals and negotiate well, when allowed to do so.

When our thoughts of career and college are shared, they come from the perspective of a young woman without a college degree who started and has run a successful business for 37 years.  

The Chicago International Airport has had significant politics over the years, this has led to stalled infrastructure development.    This has prohibited the airport from growing in a way which allows for efficiency.   The airline receiving for cargo is spread out over multiple buildings spread out in multiple areas.   Connection from the West of the airport is still not connected.  Development on the West side of the airport is necessary because there is simply no room on the east side.   The transportation between the East and West side of the airport should be connected by a highway, which has been proposed for over 20 years.  

The airport is extremely backlogged.  What took 6 hours pre-pandemic, now takes at times 3 weeks.  That is, to recover for delivery goods being imported by air for urgent supply chains.  This has built up over time and has gotten particularly bad in the past year.  Improvement is happening but it has been slow.  There are many reasons for this, but a few are: 

-	Covid staffing levels have seriously impacted operations. 
-	The ongoing Covid responses continue to plague operations as do
-	The excessive unemployment benefits.   
-	These are jobs that are not minimum wage and pay relatively well, and do not require a college degree.  
-	Not all individuals will excel just because they have a college education.

Some things that will help: 

-	Tie any infrastructure funds to the successful linking of Western access to O’Hare Airport. 
-	Stop the politics creating this outrageous ongoing inefficiency. 
-	Offer training programs for forklift drivers and cargo handling professionals (on dock employees).
-	These programs should ONLY be offered with tax incentives and/or credits for companies who can demonstrate a quality leadership and training program.   This should not be an opportunity to just apply for and get government funds and not produce results. 
-	Stop incenting young people to go to college without a defined path for success.  (Likelihood of a career in field of study.)

Two questions appear to stand out, the financial treatment of transportation upon Interstate Highways, the primary competitor for 200 mile to 1000 mile highway-convertible freight traffic on the General Railway System, and the lack of network performance metrics tied to a certain minimum fixed infrastructure needed to efficiently support domestic industry.

The activation of the CRAF to assist with Afghan evacuations recently was a great policy choice.  Part of the issues in international shipping has to do with Covid restrictions and poor personnel management by operators and owners that has stranded thousands of mariners around the world, and caused thousands more to be overworked to dangerous levels.  Meanwhile, vast excess widebody capacity exists in the CRAF.  Why not start a dialogue with the various stakeholders about some temporary operations, using CRAF flights, to get these mariners home and/or crewing available ships?

2.  Similarly, while there may be little excess capacity in the commercial division of the Merchant Marine, there is significant capacity in the National Defense Reserve Fleet that is usable for the current shipping crisis.  One cause of the shipping bottlenecks has to do with Covid-driven disruptions in the flow of shipping containers to and from the US and Asia; far too many coming our way, not enough going back.  However, correcting this makes no business sense (extremely expensive) for any individual operator.  Why not utilize a few container ships from the NDRF expressly for this purpose?  The answer could be a few major one-time voyages, or perhaps just the use of a single vessel on a regular schedule, until the current crisis is resolved. ",,,,,,,

1) It is hard to buy a truck due to shortage of electronic chips (silicone shortage) 
2) Extremely high competition for hiring new drivers. VAST majority of the companies cheat with their logbooks (companies using 3rd party eld providers which are completely corrupt if not created by the carrier and registered with FMCSA. ELDs MUST be only a few and all checked and approved by FMCSA, any other ELDs MUST be banned). Drivers tend to leave the company favoring companies that allow cheating with the logbooks so they can earn more money. THIS is a HUGE problem, it is everywhere and every one knows about it, yet no one does anything. Rules implemented by FMCSA look good on paper but yet dont work in a real world.

I am such a manufacturer,  We are a small company if 17 employees manufacturing inflatables, dry bags, camping pads, custom inflatables, and prototype work.  Except for our custom and prototype part of the buisness our production competes against Chinese goods being brought into the USA.  We buy as much domestic supplies as possible but this last year COVID and weather has hurt us as well as the supply chain issues.  For our pads (one of our biggest sellers) the Urethane Chemical shortage is a problem,  our foam has gone up 90% since November of last year.  We already had a problem with our competitors copying our products and taking them to China to bring back, now it is getting serious.  Our pads will now be 4x as expensive as the imports in stead of 2x.  It takes 3 months to get our Glue which is domestic, and have seen a 30% increase in that price also.  We use this glue for our inflatable rafts and we also produce the recovery rafts and stabalization collars for several of the space capsules.  We are getting more and more companies wishing to bring production back to the USA and we can build there product we just can't do it at the price they want. I have increase our wages which now range between $13/ hr ( for 90 day) - $24/ hr. plus profit-sharing in the form of bonuses depending on Cash flow.  Our shop rate is $85/hr to cover all our expenses.  We really need to work on the Asian imports to level the playing field this would also lower the amount of imports and make us less dependent on imports. When we manufacture here we provide more jobs than with importing.  Our biggest competitors in the raft making who also copied our pads and brought them into the US are doing 15 - 20 times the buisness we do or more with 75% less people that they pay wages to per Million dollars.   This is based on the fact that we do almost $2,000,00 in sales with 17 people,  a competitor brings his boats from china and only has 4 employees to do the same amount of Gross sales .  ",,,,,,,

They will say there is no way to contact anyone in order to help you. Or they will say let's try to be a work-in but places like Walmart won't work you in. 

In the end the driver will get held up at the shipper/receiver because of this. Impacting their ability to make on-time delivery or their next load's pickup. 

I am honestly unsure of how the government can help in this aspect. But if there are ways to create an infrastructure for communication, it would be greatly appreciated.  ",,,,,,,

This needs to be temporarily stopped.  

- Empty containers piled up have created gridlock and inhibited access to full containers.  Utilize government land to store some of these empty containers so that efficient access to the port can be restored.  Truckers can go to the temporary empty container storage area to pick up an empty container.  Additionally, any government owned chassis not currently in use should be repositioned to help move empty containers from port in California to this temporary storage area.  

- Lack of truck drivers must be addressed.  Lift the ban on truck drivers 18 to 20 years of age.

- California bans any trucks older than 2011.  Temporarily lift this ban to allow more trucks access to the ports to pick up containers.  Additionally, California does not allow owner operators access to the ports.  Temporarily lifting this ban would also provide an essential increase in truck driver availability.  

- Longer term - infrastructure at ports must be improved.  It takes twice as long to unload a container ship in California as it does in China.  We desperately need to improve our infrastructure and automation.

1) Brokers and sometimes contracted customers want the details of: when the driver arrives at the shipper/receiver, are they being loaded/unloaded, when did the driver leave the shipper/receiver, what is their ETA, etc. This usually involves constant phone calls and emails to the driver or the driver's dispatcher. 

Calls to the driver irritate them. Many of our drivers are waken up by broker phone calls asking for ETA's in the middle of the night or if they are loaded hours later. It usually occurs multiple times in these cases. Calls to the dispatcher while apart of our job, slow us down; so when we could be booking loads or helping drivers with issues we are handling broker calls. It is inefficient. 

2) When problems arise with loading or unloading, shippers and receivers are not helpful (99% of the time). When shippers and receivers hold you up, it will impact on time delivery, other deliveries, or reloading the truck with already booked loads. In these COVID related times, many drivers aren't allowed to talk to a physical person or get out of their truck to ask for an ETA. So drivers or dispatchers usually have to try to call to get an ETA. IF (and its a big IF) you are able to get ahold of someone in shipping and receiving; they typically aren't allowed to give you an ETA or the ETA is not very accurate. We have had ETA's of 20 minutes turn into 2 hours later. It impacts the drivers ability to pick up and delivery their freight. Receivers and shippers may work with us if we can give an accurate ETA. However, if we can't give a roughly accurate ETA shippers/receivers may make us reschedule for days out. Then the driver loses their reloads; decreasing the flow of freight being shipped and received. It also adds more time to shippers/receivers doing things other than getting the driver out of the facility. 

The government cannot control communication of course. However, an incentivized initiative to create a system that would help reduce these problems would be of great help. What would help would be a communication platform that could be done a variety of ways. A platform, similar to Dominos' online ordering system, of seeing what is happening to the truck via a tagging system; meaning a system where a QBC code or other is tag to a load's Purchase Order #, then when the driver arrives in the guard scan it for the in time, the shipper/receiver scan it when working on loading/unloading & when done, when the paperwork is in progress/done, and when the driver checks out with the guard. 

Platforms would either have shipper/receiver company specific sites, a universal platform that is able to run on big data, or broker specific. To create and accurate ETA there would need to be an algorithm to create an average of how long things take per facility. ",,,,,,,

Answer to question 3.

3. Warehouse capacity and availability, and any challenges faced in operating and siting/constructing those facilities, as well as challenges faced by third-party logistics service providers and other stakeholders in the logistic system.

Once an overhead map of the port complex is examined, it will be clear that old and dilapidated warehouse structures in San Pedro can be demolished to free up land for container storage.  

The challenge in freeing up this land will arise from local residents and conservation groups seeking to protect and maintain local aesthetics and air quality.  The best option is to free up land on Terminal Island, behind Evergreen, where there currently is a decommissioned Customs house, and 5 fuel tanks.

Potential drawbacks would be remediation of the land, ensuring any contamination is dealt with initially before grading and surfacing.",,,,,,,

The identification of major infrastructure or operational bottlenecks and chokepoints across all aspects of the freight and logistics supply chain—including shipping/receiving, intermodal transfer, rail/water/truck transportation, warehousing, etc.—that slow or impede efficient cargo movement within the freight and logistics sector, and the most effective investments and management practice improvements that could be made to alleviate those bottlenecks.

Warehouse jobs are in short supply and the lack of warehousemen stifles the fluid transfer of goods and return of chassis and containers back to the port. Unlike trucking, these jobs require little skill.  The National Guard could be deployed to specifically buttress and bolster that specific point in the supply chain.

Solution-
Reach out to the major warehouses and pinpoint those in need of support.  Deploy Guardsmen to help offload cargo goods at inland warehouses.

What strategies or priorities should DOT adopt to achieve the Department’s strategic goals and objectives? A task force would be an excellent start.  Utilizing such entities as the American College of Environmental and Occupational Medicine to locate healthcare professionals interested in assisting the Department in achieving its goals and objectives would be useful.
2.	How should DOT measure progress towards those priorities? The number of or decrease in occurrence of both fatal and non-fatal injuries. 
3.	What emerging challenges or opportunities in transportation warrant additional DOT activities or investments?  Specifically, as it relates to DOT drivers, there needs to be a system to monitor certified medical examiners if it is found that an increased number of drivers involved in both fatal and non-fatal incidents/collisions have been certified by a specific examiner.  Essentially, an auditing process would be necessary. 
4.	How can DOT best coordinate its activities with Federal, State, local, Tribal, labor, private sector, academic, non-profit, international, and other partners?  Requiring the use of an electronic health record to complete all certifications, would make coordinating simpler.

Specifically, Economic Strength and Global Competitiveness is least important; it will not be achieved if we do not first address the climate crisis, the epidemic of racism manifested in our transportation system, and our approach to safety that harms too many people. We need a ""moon shot"" level of change to our infrastructure to reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled by cars and trucks, reduce speeds on all road classifications, increase the cost of gasoline to include the externalities to health, climate, and environment, and invest these dividends in hardscaped safety features like protected bike lanes, pedestrianized streets, designated transit lanes and transit priority, and vastly increase funding for transit operations. ""Data-driven"" policy is subjective based on the data that is collected. Too often, ""data-driven"" is bandied about to perpetuate a system that does harm. For example, 85th percentile speeds are ""data-driven,"" but there is clear consensus and evidence of the harm created by this approach to speed limit setting. We need to stop chipping away at a status quo that disproportionately harms people of color, disenfranchises people with low incomes, and accelerates climate change. There can be no prosperity until we arrest the traffic violence and negative health and climate impacts created by our transportation system and the land uses the system enables. Frankly, this framework is near-sighted and disappointing. It enables the status quo and thus represents a complex web of auto-centric policy conflicts and misplaced hope, data analysis, and research when the solutions are clear: reduce VMT, reduce vehicle speeds, and invest in transit and active transportation.

1) High prices of fuel, insurance, taxes, tolls.  
2) Not enough truck parking spaces.  If truckers are having to pay extra for fuel and road usage through taxes, and tolls, then why aren't there enough accommodations for truckers?  Also I resent the idea that trucks cause alot of accidents, because a lot of motorists do not know how to accommodate for trucks on the road.  
3) Need more flexibility with driving time for owner operators.  I think driving rules for company drivers are needed to protect them, but Owner operators and trucking companies that have less then - let's say 5 drivers-  should have increased flexibility with driving rules to make them more competitive with big companies that have greater manpower, purchasing power and discounted services and commodities.  
4) Small trucking companies should also have a tax credit (to allow less taxation) to allow us to be competitive with big companies, and to be able to afford misfortunes that may arise due to circumstances that we cannot control, such as bad weather, accidents, equipment malfunction, illness, injuries, etc.  All these things severely impact our ability to get out on the road in order to work to make a living, or just to survive as a company.  

I hope you will consider these ideas as ways to retain owner operators and keep us happy on the road.  I think we need to find ways for drivers to be able to consider trucking as a long term career that can afford them retirement and a decent wage as business owners, despite pitfalls that may occur.  Thank you and God bless.

Back in the day they had prisoners doing manual labor on federal projects to keep cost down, and put that saved money towards other things it’s needed for.  
    It wouldn’t be hard to train prisoners the 101 on road construction projects, I mean they probably get it done quicker and in better shape, than the construction company that’s screwing over the tax payers, and paying off the guy who signs off on the job. The government could save millions and help prisoners get a new career when they do get released.

 As myself being an owner/operator car hauler, me and thousand other drivers will tell you we are sick and tired of having the same roadway under construction for years, and years.,  supervise the prisoners that we all pay for to go out and do it for free and correct the first time.

 Maybe before accepting any bids the government should do a survey and see which contractors have most accidents in their construction zones. They place cones in our lane and force tractor trailers to go off median to get by. 
  The bottom line is why should America be paying 30 times the amount for repairs to our infrastructure and roads when we have free labor just waiting to be used.  
It’s time America gets off its ass and start utilizing the work force we have before we pay others millions of dollars to do a half ass job.
 If funding is so scarce for projects, why wouldn’t you want free labor, it would just cost equipment and materials.

The amount of issues that truck drivers have to deal with every day is unfathomable, especially for small carriers and independent owner operators.
From shady freight brokers to shady factoring companies and all the other people with their hands in our pockets, it’s like the Wild West out here.
Since the start of the pandemic, truck stop restaurants have closed, leaving us with no options other than deadly fast food. Supporting services like truck repair shops are short staffed leaving our trucks sitting for weeks in end waiting for repairs.
Truck parts are becoming impossible to find and the roads are beating the heck out of our equipment.
Our ability to operate efficiently was removed in 2017 when the ELD was mandated and that resulted in  the truck parking crisis.
This happened because we are considered all the same… truck drivers.
Penalize a career long truck driver with multiple millions of accident free miles under their belt and class them the same as Joe Blow who just got his CDL last Tuesday, and this is what you get.
Release the reins of the ELD/HOS to deserving drivers/companies with outstanding safety records and watch the productivity increase.
As for the truck driver shortage, who in their right mind would enter a field where they would become redundant in a matter of a year or two? I’m talking about autonomous trucks.
The answer is not 18 year olds crossing state lines, kids are smarter than that these days.
The answer is not foreigners who can’t speak, read or write English either.
Many of us veteran truck drivers who have dedicated our whole career to the trucking industry, 
Will not make it to retirement because the industry that we’ve always loved has became extremely stressful, frustrating, dangerous and disappointing. 
But hey, believe the tech companies who race to the 800 billions dollar a year industry, let them make you believe that the roads will be safer without truck drivers and just ignore proprietary interest.
In the meantime, the Supply Chain Crisis continues. 
Maybe 5 years of useless research studies will help like all the truck parking studies that haven’t helped (sarcasm).

That would be the first step in getting this corrected. The elogs are more of a safety risk than a help.

Second go after shipper and relievers they should have loads ready and unloaders ready when trucks arrive you know your shipping something have it ready the night before for next day give a 1 hour slot to load and unload trucks if not they have to pay a mandatory fine of 500 dollars for the first hour and 150 for every additional hour over 1 hour that will get them to plan better and load and unload faster.Also have that payable to the drivers on the spot at location the company should not benefit from that the driver is the one loosing money.

Less weigh station maybe one at every entry point and one at an exit point is more than enough per state. Mandatory truck inspections done every 6 at a dot place to avoid dot waiting drivers time doing inspections on scales and road wasting drivers drive times.

Large companies that are giving new drivers licenses in 2 weeks should be regulated more they are fussing about safety example werner,swift,cr england,knight,England,, hunt, Etc those companies cause more accidents than any other small companies or owner ops. Half of those company drivers can't drive or back up makes if more unsafe than anything  putting anyone under the age of 21 behind the wheel of these semis is wreckers that will cause large amounts of accidents these kids can't drive cars yet alone a semi.major safety risk.

Make more teuck parking and when we say more we mean free because 99% of truck stops are charging now and making it harder for truckers to find places to park and most states now are putting no parking signs on side of roads and exit ramps because it is more about profit for their state in ticket revenue than having their goods delivered.

Also when you get your cdl on the drivers test it states truck should go at speed of traffic because of safety reasons thank quit putting truck speed and 4 wheeler speed different it should all be same speed for all if its 70  or 75 than everyone should go at that speed kudos to Texas on that. 

Regulate fuel cost we pay more in fuel than most loads pay diesel is the cheapest to make but the highest priced sold no reason why any truck driver should be paying more than a 1.50 for diesel. 

Another great idea would be make lanes just for trucks on the highways no cars allowed that would open up highways and get things transported alot faster have officers at truck lanes because cars always like to cut in where truck are",,,,,,,

  The goverment waste stupid money on construction and surveys and still has no clue as to why traffic is bad!!  Put express lanes in major cities and don’t have any exits in it till you on other side of said city. If trucks were out of the way of daily commuters,(which need to be in the right lane) for their exit, the trucks which are the backbone to America would be more efficient and accidents would be more likely to just involve 4 wheelers.  
   Most of us truck drivers are professional drivers, but yet we are the ones treated like shit on the highways and byways of this great nation.  Maybe someone in the goverment needs to take a ride with a few drivers in rush hour traffic to realize, it isn’t the trucks screwing up the commute. The same people every day that have been working the same place for 10-20 years purposely wait till last minute to get off their exit, which cause’s the back up, put trucks in left lane with express lane that has no exits until other side of major city, the traffic will be easier on everyone, there is no reason us professional drivers should even be put in the situation to deal with stupid car traffic during rush hour.  The goverment needs to realize we move this great nation, so start treating us with the respect and dignity we have. Without trucks America stops!!!
    Please for the love of god and are country, put someone in charge of the Dot that actually understands how the interstate system is designed to work, instead of some college educated idiot that never even driven on half of our roads and highways.. it’s time to start listening to the truck drivers that actually know the problems..  and actually listen to us to help rectify the issue. I’m sure there are plenty of studies that show trucks need to be in right 2 lanes, but I would like to know your logic and meet the dumb bastard that thinks that was a solution to the problem. Quit circling around the problem and fix it!!! We pay all kinds of fuel tax, highway tax but yet we aren’t allowed to use the roads which are there for our job at 100% because you cut us out of the common sense lanes(left lane) going into cities.   
  Wake up and use your common sense, fixing traffic and road construction isn’t hard to figure out, but you need to understand how things work before trying to fix it!!

The African American communities of Chesapeake and Suffolk Virginia have been used to apply for those funds.  The funds are not used to help these communities.  VDOT signed the 2006 Devolution Road Take Over with the City of Suffolk.  The Council voted to accept the take over and stated right in the council meeting of April 2005 and vote of June 2006 that ""no way were they going to turn all the rural areas urban.  VDOT required the Urban street system of gutters, drainage and sidewalks.  The two cities have required this for new developments.  We are surrounded by new developments and continue to invade our neighborhoods with new developments while we pay the taxes and storm water fees of which no storm water management was ever placed in the African American Communities.  The town of Oakland Chuckatuck still have septic tanks, with the waters from ditches of new developments causes sewage to back up in the pipes of the homes when there is heavy rain. One of the residents died following a back up in her home in August 2021. 
The Pughsville Community; comprised of Chesapeake and Suffolk Virginia.  Both cities continue to receive funds yearly from VDOT to maintain and develop the urban system of sidewalks, gutters and drainage and has not.  All monies they put in the Comprehensive Improvement Budget of Chesapeake (CIB) and the Comprehensive Improvement Program (CIP) for our area they lists the funds received from the government and VDOT as a study and will be doing work as late as 2023 before they have to give back any funds.  We have been trying to at least get the main ditches cleaned out and fix broken pipes so the water can flow.  They have refused since 2006.  Now with new development a pipe for a new driveway to a new home built causes more flooding than ever as it has not been cleared to move the water out.  We are forced to pay taxes and storm water fees when we have never had storm water maintance since 2006 when Federal Government implemented it.  We have talked, walked, emailed and sit with everyone from both city councils, the Federal VDOT in Washington who dismissed our complaint (Eric Lacayco).  Senator Warner since local VDOT Civil Rights person from Hampton Roads (Queen Crittenden).  She saw the plight, yet wrote back and refused to tell the whole truth in her January 6, 2021 to Senator Warner.  We attended the resiliency public meeting in Chesapeake with Ms. Ann Phillips from the Governor's Office.  She wanted to see for herself.  She came to our neighborhood and could not believe what we were suffering thru.  She also spoke with us on the zoom of the Flood preparedness plan and we discovered more money was given to both cities.  We have floods, unclean ditches and the water saturates the lawn until the sun dries it up.  Homes and land have been damaged.  We only ask for the water from the woods be piped down Taylor Ave.  We also ask that pipes be put in our main thoroughfare, Townpoint Road.  We only ask for one sidewalk,(down Townpoint Road) when we should have one on both sides of the street. Both cities are paving the woods for a Seaboard walking and running Trail and won't even pave the ""paper streets"" where African American Residents have paid taxes and they won't allow them to build on the properties unless the develop the paper street with drainage, sidewalks, guttering and under ground wiring.  We have tall light poles here.  No underground wiring has been done by City of Chesapeake or Suffolk since Pughsville was established.  The developers come and build on the paper streets by purchasing properties on the paper street that fronts the VDOT streets that were in the system.  African Americans are so tired of the disparity of the two cities.  Funds needs to be placed in an account separate from the cities just so the African Americans can get what their monies are paying for.  We pay more taxes than our properties are worth because the new homes purchased here cost three times the price of ours.  So, again we suffer the challenges and have no opportunities to survive.  The Strategic Plan would work if the system wasn't so jacked up. ",,,,,,,

I talk to hotshot drivers all over who are motivated to be a part of the trucking industry. The downfall for us that own hotshot trucks is the brokers try to get us to haul the unwanted freight for pennies compared to regular flatbed haulers. Hotshot trucking has loss it’s place as I knew from years back. Hotshot as I knew it were responsible for getting loads to locations quicker when bigger trucks couldn’t get it there on time.   Now it seems like the brokers hold the loads a make hotshot owners wait all day while they wait for the lowest bid or one of their regulars to get it. Brokers will tie up numerous trucks for the same single load. They should post all loads at a fair amount and give it to the first truck that’s available to get it instead of having 20 trucks wait for that loads when they can be on the roads delivering other much needed freight to its destination. The brokers are discouraging us which is causing further shortages of available trucks while they brag amount their record net profits. How selfish, but they can do that because no one is regulating that side of the broker practices ",,,,,,,

They’re constantly trying to make up time in slower speed zones. Also, clogging up the left lane. The problem with our industry is there’s no one fit for every sector in the trucking industry. I think that years of service should warrant better options. Meaning someone with minimal experience shouldn’t be able to work as many hours as someone with five years of service. Most of the larger companies will have their drivers out for weeks at a time. With that said, a driver has to take a 34 hour break to reset their work available hours clock. Why? If someone has two years experience and has a good safety rating, they should be allowed to work their maximum 14 hours per day without a 70 hour clock. That would allow them to make money the whole time they’re away from their family. They would be happier with their pay and it would incentivize them to keep a good safety rating while helping with driver retention. The other issue that I feel drives out retention is states that the DOT officers aren’t there to educate new drivers. They’re too concerned with writing tickets!  By the way, a warning is just as bad as a ticket for their safety rating. Example:, I was driving with a driver that was pulled into a rest area in Ohio. The DOT officer detained that driver for almost an hour. The truck he was driving was only two weeks old! They couldn’t find anything wrong so they had him open up his safety triangles which were wrapped in plastic because they had never been used. When they opened them up, there was a hairline crack in one of them. He was cited for faulty equipment. It was literally a 78.00 fine but it ruined that drivers over twenty years of safe driving record. Anyway, if you want safe drivers, you can’t push them to the brink of disaster with all of these regulations that threatens his job while allowing cars and motorcycles to just zip in and out with no safe stopping distance and always come after the truck driver.

It's been proven that cars move the least amount of people. Cars should be more of an option for long distance and not for every single trip within a city. What would significantly help is changing zoning laws to include more mixed use development and not single family homes. To make a city more walkable you have to make it more convenient and bring businesses closer. Also give pedestrians/bikes and public transit the top priority for intersections. Otherwise there's no incentive to choose other modes if they have to wait alongside car-centric traffic. Improving walkability for cities will improve sales and tourism. The more people walk around the more likely they will stop in a store or just socialize making the city more attractive. It's why people visit Europe so much.

The difference in enforcement of laws. Why is it that people in cars can get away with so much but if a truck is seen even infringing on a law, we get stopped and ticketed. I understand that we are bigger and cause a much worse accident if we’re involved but last study I heard about found that 80% of car, truck accidents are caused by the car. So when the general public gets away with breaking the rules and trucks don’t, who is more dangerous? And the more they get away with, the more they push it. 

Csa scores. A lot of companies are basing part of the drivers pay on csa scores. If I am involved in anything traffic or inspection related, I loose money for 3 years until my score is 0 again. Even a written warning or getting recorded as being involved in an accident which I was not ticketed for, cost me pay for 3 years. You want to talk about something that causes stress. 

Off road lights on the highway. Why doesn’t anyone get stopped for running off road lights or even not dimming their lights anymore? This would include everyone including truck drivers. Quit coming up with new stuff to enforce and enforce what’s already on the books. 


Everything that happens on the road is not our fault. You really need to reign in the lawsuits over every little mishap or give us the ability to sue or counter sue. It’s getting a little better now that most of us are running cameras but it’s still an uphill battle and a huge source of stress. You worry about how many hours we work but you won’t do jack about the things you could do something about that cause us stress which is not only irritating but hard on our health. 


An idea that I’ve had for hours of service. Instead of trying to lump us all into one set of rules that are more restrictive than necessary, now that every law enforcement vehicle has a laptop and internet, why not offer drivers with very good records the ability to run how they want. If we start messing up, you put us back on the rules. A simple data base would be all that would be required. The drivers that got onto that database would tend to guard that privilege jealously. And it would give bad drivers something positive to work towards. Why not more carrot and less stick?

I actually work for a company that I think pays me fairly. Most of the time that I spend sitting at a customer for more than 2 hours, I get paid for. I make good money per mile. With me, the things I’ve spelled out above are the things I’m getting tired of and make me want to do something else.

Many existing infrastructures are ugly, inefficient and are a great burden on taxpayers and businesses. Isn't it time for a real change. Ask yourself, how long can we continue to maintain our roads. The ASCE estimates a $3.4 trillion deficit just in maintaining the status quo. Does anyone really believe that asphalt will somehow get cheaper, or that the workforce shortages will solve themselves. 

It is so bad that we don't even have school bus drivers. Does someone really believe that autonomous 'free-range' vehicles will match up with the ingenuity of human stupidity?

And EVs - isn't it time to acknowledge that these batteries are destined to burn more than just holes in pockets. They are a fire hazard that the average consumer wont ever understand no less be able to afford.

I strongly recommend that you reach out to the people who have worked on guideway based transportation with its lightweight infrastructure expected to last a century or more without all the hazards/accidents and problems that we have accepted/tolerated for a century of surface transportation.

We need a transportation system that is perfectly safe, convenient to use, fast and cheap. I have been working on a follow-up to the FTA Report 26 on Urban Low Speed MagLev Transportation. We can and will make an elevated maglev system which can far exceed the capabilities of ALL surface based vehicles and which does cost the same as regular highways (or less). And it can be made cheaply with new materials and new methods. 

This resolves all equity issues as well as all transportation issues and any climate concerns caused by transportation as a whole. IF your Strategy focus on the problems that are solved by different projects rather than continuing to accept some very marginal technologies that serve only to make some people very rich. Electric vehicles will continue to cost more than half of our population can afford. 

ON the other hand, MicroRail's elevated guideway system could replace the need to even own a car. That's about $10,000 a year that every family can cut from their budget. We'll provide you cheap, safe and fun transportation 24/7/365 in any weather for less than $5/day or $1000/year. Imagine door-to-door on-demand voice-controlled, smooth, silent, quick and personal travel. To the doctor, the dentist, the grocery store, the cleaner's or the club - wherever we our guideway has been deployed, you can go. And we expect to deploy 1 mile per week per team with twelve or more teams to start. That 600 miles per year. Of course more teams means much larger coverage - right down your street to your driveway or your door.

The investment would be in a new vocational program that would train and prepare High School juniors and Seniors for a potential career in the truck driving industry. 
  Each year every new graduating class has students that begin careers in trades that do not require a college degree - trades that they began developing while in High School vocational programs. The trucking industry losses many potential professional drivers to other trades, due to the fact that there is an age restriction for interstate drivers, that being 21 years old, as well as a complete lack of vocational training at the high school level for commercial driving.  There are many driving jobs that are intrastate and do not have age restrictions, allowing for skill development and experience during this period from 18-21.
 Investment in a vocational education program for High School Juniors and Seniors could prepare a student for all aspects of commercial driving. The following is an example curriculum that could be used to develop these skills while still at the high school level:  
Junior year- all in-class and shop training. Distracted driving, defensive driving, general on-the-road truck maintenance, Hours-of-service, drug and alcohol, FMCSA regulations, law enforcement understanding and roadside inspections, safe dock procedures, wetline and hydraulics, end-dump and roll-offs.
Senior year- on property training for implementing junior year training. Begin  maneuverability training in large vehicles on property, preparation for truck driving such as truck stop safety, scale procedures, state regulation differences, registering and permitting, autonomous vehicles, etc.
This would also help to keep potential drivers from going to other trades, thus helping to eliminate the driver shortage. 
This would help with equity by providing training to those that may not have affordable commercial driver training available in their area. This would also help those find good paying jobs in a field that they might not have had an opportunity or even considered before. 
 A more educated and prepared commercial driver is a much safer driver on the road. This would be a big step forward in helping to make the nation’s roads safer for all. 
 I believe that this transformation and approach to commercial driver education would be a change to the culture of the career field. A more educated, prepared and informed generation of commercial driver would bring a new awareness to the trucking world. Possibly eliminating stigma's of the typical truck driver and commercial driver career. This may also introduce a career in commercial driving to every gender and ethnicity, many of whom may have never considered this type of career in the past.

With so many outcomes intended to provide more innovative and accessible modes and forms of public transportation, I'd like to see design work be more than utilitarian, whether we're talking about the interior of a light rail car, or the design of a railway terminal or bus stop. The impact of good design can be spiritually and psychologically uplifting, and make a positive difference in our lives. To fill public transportation systems with works of art, platforms for performance (think of the number of street musicians who serenade subway riders in New York City, or consider an accomplished musician such as Yo Yo Ma setting up his cello at a DC Metro stop) and it doesn't take much to imagine how this sort of improvised exposure to the arts can be amplified. The arts are essential to all aspects of our country's infrastructure -- financial (voluminous documentation exists verifying the annual fiscal contribution of live performances, museums, and galleries to local, state, and federal budgets) and spiritual (the countless ways in which architecture, sculpture, artwork, along with the performing arts lift our spirits, stir our emotions, provoke our thoughts) -- and in considering the future of transportation systems in America, I firmly believe the arts could and should play a significant role in whatever is envisioned, funded, and accomplished. Engaging an arts ""brain trust"" in planning would be a wise, inclusive, and productive first step towards the integration of which I write and about which I am concerned.  Thank you.  ",,,,,,,

However, most of their trucks still can only do 62 or 63 mph because the governors have not been changed to the new limit. These trucks cross the border and impeed traffic. If one is doing 63 mph and another is doing 63 1/2,they try and pass causing a traffic back up for miles. This also causes road rage. It's no wonder the public has a problem with big trucks on the road. Also, the Canadian trucks bypass the scales. That should never be allowed. They should always be required to enter the scales. And another thing.  99% of the Canadian drivers I see are on their cell phones. It doesn't matter if there in a heavy rain, snow or even construction. They've got their cell phone in their hand or laying in their lap looking down at it.

Remove  the hearing requirements you can't hear outside of the truck anyway. Seeing as the trucking industry is what keeps the country  going let's get rid of the over taxation that trucking companies have to pay. The Federal interstate  system  was designed  for military  and commercial  use not the public.  So tax the cars that use the interstate not the trucking companies. Let's go to one license and one test to obtain a cdl. One testing standard and make it so it doesn't  matter what state you receive  training  if you pass you can go back to your home state and get your license. If your not a US citizen  then you don't get your cdl license. More parking spaces for large trucks. Lower fuel tax. Bring back the paper logs for small companies. All weight station should have clear sign to understand  weather  they are open or close. A closed weight station should  also be a safe place for driver to park and not be harassed. Standard training  for dot officers. Standard  speed limits  for truck and cars in all states. No ban on lane usage.  All major  city want to keep truck in the right lanes that's where all the traffic enters and exits the roadway. So now we have more wrecks. California  need to be the same as the rest of the states  on speed limits  and small companies  as the rest of the country. With no age limits on trucks and allow people to be self employed with one truck.there should not be extra taxes by the states when the federal government  taxes the trucks more than enough. Toll road should be free the the trucking industry after all we help build  it. Bring back the old log book rules 10 hours of driving  8 hour sleeper add the 34 hours restart. No required  break we will stop when we get hungry. No truck stop should be allowed  to charge for parking.no state or federal laws on how long the trucks can be running. Your home heater or ac stays on while your at work. We live  and work in the same room.all weight station  should have a pretty pass system  and it should work in all states. One license plate and one fee. Fmcsa was to control everything then make it one Standard  for everyone. It should not be because  of who's president.  It should be because  we are Americans  all for one and one for all.no discrimination  because of disability.  If you are physical enough  to drive a car you are physical enough to get a cdl.you want safer roads close the border and require anyone that wants to drive in this country you must attend a cdl class to to get your car license.  And anyone that has a license for a car must attend a cdl class every  ten years  to renew there car license. Let's tax cars the same way the government  taxes the trucking industry. The next time the fmcsa  comes up with  new hours of service  rules why don't you live by them first. Run your office  by the hours of service rules and see how you like them.

Ensuring that carriers are safe and compliant is key in this effort.  A common practice that is taking place is illegal double brokering.  It seems many in our industry think this practice is acceptable as there is very little effort to enforcement the laws currently in place to stop it.  

Co-brokering is a great team effort when every party involved understands the transactions taking place.  Illegal double brokering causes a tremendous amount of expense and legal battles due to accidents, freight claims and non-payments.  Most concerning is it leads innocent parties, unknowingly, into taking part in releasing unsafe, unvetted, dangerous carriers on the highway.

It would be easy to stop illegal double brokering if we used the tools and help available.  Once those that practice this understand it is not acceptable, the practice will slow down if not cease.  

Would you please consider creating a source where we can submit evidence of loads illegally double brokered and take action on the information you are provided? The online complaint form is not sufficient for this cause.  You could start by requesting bids from companies willing to help in this effort and streamline the process.  This could be a great revenue producer, via the $10,000 fine for illegal double brokering, and make our highways safer by allowing shippers and brokers to vet the carriers they use.

Each year about 350 people die, and thousands of others are injured, in automobile accidents caused by wrong-way drivers. Drive-tron is a software laser scanner apparatus, that’s specifically designed to detect and to reduce the speed of wrong way drivers on a freeway or double lane highway.
The software scanner system will be created and designed to detect all opposite facing traffic signs and symbols.  Opposite facing traffic signs are the images that one would see if he or she was driving on the wrong side of the road; Such as the back view of the stop sign or traffic light, or the backside of the speed limit sign, or the opposite facing pavement turning arrows.
To achieve its objective, the software scanner system will employee one or two scan heads, along with a kill switch for reducing the speed of the engine. The sensor apparatus will be attached to the center front (inside/outside) of the vehicle with a daytime scanning range of 42ft. horizontally and 80 to 120 ft. vertical.
Due to the loss of visibility after dark ranges will be altered.  For after dark hours, the concept creator envisions the ranges to be 24ft horizontal and 80 to 120 vertical, also night time scanning ranges should rest at the 3 o’clock mark.  The controlled invisible laser beam system may require the use of a laser rangefinder.
Important note:  Recognition of the DO NOT ENTER or the WRONG WAY sign, will prompt the immediate activation of the system.  Meaning the system would turn the lights off, the emergency signal on, and kill the power to the engine.
The system will be of a continuous run nature; it will activate and deactivate with the turning on or off of the ignition. The design of the system will better serve the general public by protecting them from wrong-way drivers.  All final dimension and specification will be determined by those trained in the field of laser technology. For the safety of the general public, autonomous vehicle should possess such technology as well.

How will it work?
The scanning of two opposite facing traffic objects, will serve as an indication to the system itself that a motorist is driving in the wrong direction. Upon detecting that a motorist is driving in the wrong direction, the system within two hundred feet of additional driving, will turn the lights off, the emergency signal on, and kill the power to the engine. 

Claims:
1.	Method of claim:  A method whereby a computer software program consists of opposite facing traffic and roadway signs/symbols.

2.	Method of claim:  A laser beam scanner comprised: of a beam, scanning, distance, and control device that interlinks with said traffic software.

3	Method of claim:  A method whereby said software and laser scanner interconnects with a kill switch in order to reduce the speed of a vehicle.
 
4	Method of claim: A method whereby said software and laser scanner turns off the head lights, activate the emergency signals, and downgrade the power of the engine.

5	Method of claim: A method whereby said program is able to reboot itself with the short passage of time.

Field of background:
Wrong way driving is the leading cause of head on collision.  About 350 people die, and thousands of others are injured, each year in the United States as a result of automobile accidents caused by wrong-way drivers on highways, including those driving the wrong way on highway ramps.  
Summary of concept:
For all concerned, the idea addresses the need for a more predictable out come when encountering wrong- way drivers. Upon detecting that a motorist is driving in the wrong direction, and to ensure that the RIGHT driver maintains his or her visibility at night, drive-tron will simultaneously #1.  Turn off the head lights of the WRONG driver, #2. Activate his/her emergency signal, and #3. Reduce the power to the engine; resulting in a more favorable out-come for all involved.

Assistance Move Over Unit

While the officer engages or interacts with a stopped motorist, his or her safety is in the hands of a DISTRACTED general public. While conducting their duties on the side of the roadways, law enforcement officers are injured or killed in the line of duty by approaching vehicles.

Presently, the move over law is like trying to play baseball without a bat. The AMO-UNIT is going to be the BAT to DRIVE the law home. The AMO-UNIT is modern day futuristic policing

The assistance mover over unit is a safety device, design to assist police officers, during traffic stops: The device will assist officers by directing and controlling all APPROACHING traffic. For the safety of the officer, all traffic coming toward the officer will be admonished to first MOVE OVER (change lanes) Secondly TO PRECEDE WITH CAUTION (slowdown).

Similar in appearance to the traffic control device or a state approved roadway sign: The assistance move over unit will be installed and attached to the outside rear of the patrol car. Concerning the enabling or disabling of the unit, the officer will have full control of such. With the flip of a switch, the officer can turn the unit ON or OFF.

When not in use or in the off position, the unit will recline itself in a HORIZONTAL position. When activated (turn on) the unit will elevate itself to a VERTICAL position. The portable light /sign will be design to meet each state requirement for FLASHING traffic control devices.

Method of Claim #1: A method whereby a functioning traffic control device is attached to the rear of a patrol car.

Method of Claim #2: A method whereby upon request said device can be enabled or disabled.

Method of Claim #3: A method whereby said device upon request will SHIFT from its horizontal positioning to a vertical position.

Method of Claim #4 A method whereby the mechanical apparatus can host an array of safety signs such as MOVE OVER, CAUTION, SLOW DOWN, OR A POINTING ARROW SIGN.
 
Method of Claim #5 A method whereby said device or system can extend itself 10-30 ft or more beyond the rear of the patrol car.



Field of concept: 

The disclosed theory relates generally to methods and systems for protecting the life of a police officer while conducting his/her duties during a traffic stop.

Description of the background: 

While the officer engages or interacts with a stopped motorist, his or her safety is in the hands of a PREOCCUPIED public. While conducting their duties on the side of the roadways, law enforcement officers are injured or killed in the line of duty by approaching vehicles.

To ensure a safe passage: The assistance move over unit will serve as the AUTHORITY, as it HELP protect the safety of the officer as well as the stopped motorists.

Summary of concept:

The present idea address the need for keeping officers safe during a routine traffic stop; by providing a way for the officer to simultaneously control the approaching traffic, and conduct his affairs at the same time.

The assistance move over unit, hence forth known as the AMO-UNIT, will significantly transform how motorist approach emergency vehicles.  The AMO-Unit is another safety tool for our brave men and women of law enforcement.

Field of concept:
The disclosed theory relates generally to methods and systems for facilitating an electronic identification system via way of vehicle to vehicle.  Said method addresses the antiquated approach to policing or the non-routine traffic stop. 

Description of the background: 
Law enforcement officers are killed in the line of duty as they approach unknown or dangerous suspects in vehicles.  The tag is currently used as a means of identification, however; the tag reveals the registration not the operator thereof, nor the operator of a loaned, rented or stolen vehicle.  This identification system will increase the safety of our law enforcement officers by allowing them to safely identify the operator and occupants prior to approaching the vehicle.  With their (motorist) identity readily known, recorded and transmitted back to the substation; violent suspects will be less likely to commit a violent crime against a peace officer.
Also, the perceived threat/fear of the police will be lessened by all motorist, especially people of color. If implemented, this system will help curb bad policing as well.

Summary of concept:
The present idea addresses the need apparent in prior art by providing systems and methods for facilitating electronic mobile identification transaction between law enforcement via a global communication network.

Claim:

A method of facilitating electronic identification between a motorist and a law enforcement officer.  Either by ATM interface software or by a finger printing identification system or by way of blue tooth, radio signals, infrared light beams or vehicle to vehicle technology. 
With this system, and prior to approaching a motorist, the officer will be able to solicit vital and potentially life-saving information from a dangerous suspect.  This system could save the life of a peace officer or it could prevent the death of a non-threatening incompliance motorist.
Having ATM interface software which controls a display by global communication network; said method comprises the step by display, ATM swipe card, blue tooth, Wi-Fi, or infrared technology an identification system by which a motorist can transmit his/her driver licenses information to a police traffic officer……………………….
1.	Method of claim: ATM data further comprises driver profile data associated with motorist information of said state driver’s license division.  The transaction is associated with information contain in the state data base.

2.	 Method of claim:  Is electronically performed by the operator of the vehicle; the process network is the state driver’s license division.  By satellite or a networking system, the transaction is settled between the traffic officer and the state license division.

3.	Method of claim:  Is performed by a facilitator of the identifying transaction, the process network is an entity that performs and maintains driver’s license information.

4.	Method of claim:  Wherein the transaction is a motorist driver’s license which was issued by the state, for added security in case of lost or stolen driver’s license a 4 digits’ pin code could be required.  

5.	Method of claim:   Driver will be able to identify his/herself prior to the traffic officer exiting and approaching said vehicle.  Identification system would require the motorist to answer additional questions as well, such as how many adults are in the vehicle?  More importantly are there any weapons inside of the automobile.  The answers will be displayed directly on the squad car monitor. Yet and still, the officer should proceed with caution.

6.	Method of claim:  For additional security and prior to approaching the vehicle, by way of the identification system, the traffic officer can require all adults present in the automobile to identify themselves; by ATM swipe card, blue tooth, Wi-Fi, or some form of infrared technology.

7.	Method of claim:  wherein the first format comprises at least one of extensible make up languages (XML) or wireless make up language (WML)

8.	Method of claim:  Wherein said transaction data comprises an inquiry from the ATM swipe card display, identifying the of occupants and or weapons within the vehicle, if there be any.

9.	Method of claim:  The unit could be self contained whereby the ATM/ blue tooth, Wi-Fi, or infrared Finger printing software is equipped to simply display the printed information of the driver’s driving license only.  The transaction will be settled between the traffic officer and the vehicle operator.  From a cost-efficient standpoint this method is more plausible.  copyrighted concept.

Topic: Creating Safer Roadways- The solution To Distracted Driving
Texting while driving has become a ubiquitous problem that legislature alone cannot fix. To cure the nation of distracted driving (cellular device) Regulatory reform is required by NHTSA, the Federal Trade Commission and OECD Directorate for Science, Technology, and Industry (DSTI)

Texting and driving are a social or societal issue that must be address at the highest level of government. Social regulation is intended to protect the well-being and
rights of society at large. 

Safety and health regulations are intended to protect the well-being of the population largely through controlling hazards arising from products and the workplace. 

For the topic of discussion, it is imperative that our government acts as a referee to oversee market activity and the behavior of private actors in the economy.  Such government intervention in the marketplace is usually justified on the basis of market failures and the need to ensure societal well-
being.

The cell phone industry will not regulate itself, therefore, government reform is necessary. This concept needs to be researched, investigated, studied, evaluated and considered as a viable solution to the crisis surrounding distracted. 
The directive of the reform is to reduce texting while driving, therefore, the eradicate this phenomenon governmental agencies should work together to require that cell phones be redesigned to incorporate specialized software that will save hundreds of lives each year. 

IMAGE:  software is specifically designed to block all access to social media on a driver’s hand-held device while the vehicle is in operation.   The IMAGE storage data bank contains thousands of motorized interior/exterior IMAGEs. The device’s camera operations will be integrated with the device’s social communication division (text, email, face book, gaming). By facilitating the camera/social media interface, the IMAGE software regulates these two elements and restricts access all various forms of social communication while the vehicle is moving or in drive mode.
“IMAGE employs the camera lens and its proprietary software for the good of society.”    When GPS movement is detected by IMAGE, the software will block the user (driver only) from talking on a handheld device.  IMAGE software will also prevent the utilization of all manipulative dependent social media and operational apps as well. When the vehicle is stopped, and put in park, the non-movement of the vehicle will restore the device’s capability to receive, place a call, or to operate any of the social media apps.  Although non-movement will grant access to the social media division, resumption of GPS movement would once again restrict all phone usage to hands-free (Bluetooth) operation only. 
How this system works:  A picture is taken of the vehicle with the device’s camera.  The picture/IMAGE will then trigger a simulation search within the (proposed) no-texting storage bank.  The software in the device will compare the driver’s photograph with the bank of no texting storage locations and establish a default to either grant or deny access to the device operation of social communication apps/icons. The device will also ping for other devices in the vehicle. If there are no other devices, the device will automatically default to shut down usage of the device for any manipulative social communication apps/icons applications. Depending upon the selected module, (laser mapping) other devices in the vehicle may be active for full usage within passenger compartment locations.

My suggestion would be spend a few dollars with STATE Trade Schools to create training courses this industry.  Truckers, Motorcoach Companies, School Bus Districts, Area Transit; all need these trained individuals for future success and continued safety for the transportation industry.  
  I would offer a curriculum based certificate with the opportunity to get the CDL with endorsements when completed.  Most transportation companies would jump at the idea of hiring new talent that has been trained properly.  small disadvantaged transportation companies cannot afford to offer a training department as larger ones do.  Local Vo Tech schools could be the answer.
 Equipment for the courses:  I believe you will find MFG Companies will jump at the idea of helping sponsor the courses with donated equipment.  This is also a way to keep cost down for the programs and fresh equipment for the students.  Most truck and bus MFG companies I have spoken with would consider the idea as a win for the industry.

	Re: Docket No. DOT-OST-2021-0140, USDOT Strategic Plan

Dear Secretary Buttigieg:

On behalf of the American Highway Users Alliance (Highway Users), a coalition of 300 organizations including companies, trade associations, safety advocacy groups, and motoring clubs that represent millions of motorists and serve as the united voice of the roadway users’ community, we appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the draft DOT Strategic Framework. Allowing for feedback from the stakeholder community is a welcome opportunity to voice our thoughts on such an important undertaking for the nation.
First, we commend your focus on safety and working toward a future where transportation-related serious injuries and fatalities are eliminated. The Highway Users couldn’t agree more with this focus. With the serious uptick in roadway fatalities the nation has been experiencing over the past two years this priority must be at the top of the list. The increased investment provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), including approximately $3 billion added to the Highway Safety Improvement Program, is the right investment at this critical time. 
The Highway Users is also supportive of the inclusion of transformation as a priority. The nation must be investing in purpose-driven research and innovation to meet the challenges of the present and modernize a transportation system of the future. Through advancing research and testing new innovations we can build our roadways for the future. Our vehicle fleet is changing with new advanced safety technologies and autonomous vehicles ready for testing and deployment we need to ensure our roadways are prepared for these vehicles to thrive. For example, one simple engineering improvement that could help assist autonomous vehicles as they deploy but also help all drivers is widening pavement markings from the traditional 4-inch width to 6 inches. This improvement will help keep the autonomous vehicle in their lane and at the same time help all drivers to cut down on lane departure. 
One area we would suggest adding to the framework and including in the Strategic Plan is a focus and prioritization on highway investment. We appreciate that, as drafted, the framework does not mention any mode.  But, by far the greatest amount of passenger and freight movement in this country is on the road, and improving highway transportation is important. Investment in highways, whether by the Federal, State, or local governments contributes to economic growth and improves roadway safety. Funding in the BIL represents a significant increase over prior investment levels for roads, bridges, and major projects.  This includes a roughly 30% increase in highway funding from the Highway Trust Fund over the next 5 years plus major additional appropriations from the General fund for bridges and other investments.  This highway funding will create jobs, improve passenger and freight mobility through roadway improvements, upgrade facilities, and reduce congestion. Additionally, these roadway improvements will drive down fatalities and serious injuries on our roadways. 
Again, we truly appreciate having the opportunity to comment on the draft DOT Strategic Framework. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at lauraperrotta@highways.org or 571-239-0765. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
 
Laura Perrotta, CAE
President and CEO

Docket #:  FHWA-2021-0021

The City of Blaine, MN would like to comment on the FHWA related sections of the recently signed Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL).  These comments are intended to help facilitate the implementation of the BIL in a manner that best supports the needs of the public.

 There are several areas of the DOT Strategic Framework where a focus on investment can significantly improve the service and deliverability of projects.

1.	The new Planning and Environmental Linkages (PEL) study process requires a significant amount of up front effort and community outreach.  Use of this process aids in project development by finding and addressing issues that would typically create delays of redesign if found later in the standard project development process.  This has already show great success in ensuring all stakeholders (regulatory federal, state, local plus impacted private entities) are informed and in agreement with the evaluation process and plans to advance a project before it begins the review and approval process.  Projects utilizing this new methodology should be given preference in project award to recognize the extra effort made by the local agencies and continue the momentum of success for future projects.  

2.	This PEL process directly addresses two of the DOT Strategic Priorities:  Climate & Sustainability by taking on the environmental framework aspects of a project at its initial stages and creating an evaluation matrix that recognizes that transportation projects help and impact more than just the driving public.  Secondly the PEL process aids in Organizational Excellence through the transparency and inclusiveness it brings to project development.

3.	The impacts of highway projects dividing communities is finally being recognized and especially the disproportionate impact on lower income areas.  Projects that show how they are restoring equity within communities show be given priority in selection for project awards.  Highways are often the biggest barrier between low income or environmental justice population centers and the goods and services or employment centers they need.  Any project that can improve access between such sources and destinations will benefit all citizens.

Unfortunately, the large majority of cities and towns continue to follow a sprawling development pattern, which in turn pushes DOTs to build bigger (and often less safe) roadways to accommodate the congestion.  It's the dog chasing it's own tail.

The USDOT needs to take a leadership role to teach, promote, and encourage local governments how to more effectively plan their communities.  By changing from a suburban model to better community design, people will be less reliant on driving long distances and communities will be more poised to create walkable environments and make transit a viable option.  It will also allow us to better spend the limited transportation dollars that exist for repair of existing infrastructure.

One way to move to this more sustainable model of development is to incentivize states to create offices within the state DOT with the focus on land use and transportation planning.  These offices, staffed with professional land-use planners, would then be available to teach and advise local governments.  They could also provide technical assistance and funding to formulate better local plans.

The transportation strategic planning should address the urban planning cause and how to transform the big cities and their transportation network, reorganizing where people, workplace and commerce should be moved to minimize the need for transports.
Therefore, with this in mind, the Urban Planning Strategy will look up what can be done to route and trying to solve the cause and not only meliorate the issue.
And also give directives for expanding old and creating of new communities.

As the head of my transportation planning section, I want to offer comments regarding the potential use of funds for the betterment of transportation infrastructure nationwide. 

I want to focus on transit in particular. When releasing NOFOs for the current legislation, I would encourage programmatic funding for competitive and formula grants for the following:

1. Targeted Microtransit (vehicles providing on demand service within 3-5 miles radius that connect to regional bus and rail options) to resolve the first and last mile issues we face as a suburban and urban community (15 passenger or less electric vehicles with COVID shielding). 

2. Integration of micro mobility parking and rideable infrastructure to resolve first and last mile issue (including scooters, ADA chairs, and bicycles/e-bikes)

3. Increased operational funding for LOTS (capital and operating)

4. Alteration of formula funding to consider population in ""emerging transit"" areas that currently do not have as many active fixed route lines.

5. Altoona tested electric buses that are smaller in size (under 31 feet) to support circulator, loop service in suburban urban and rural communities

6. Fast charging infrastructure grants

7. Roadway and bus stop improvement projects to accommodate transit riders, pedestrians and bicyclists (existing and planned transit)

8. Real-time bus infrastructure at bus stops, heated stops, solar powered stops

9. Operations and maintenance facilities for emerging transit organizations

10. Universal applications for bus passes and real time arrival apps that integrate statewide and cross border",,,,,,,

This upcoming rule change requiring Behind The Wheel Instructors for Entry Level Driver Training has NO Grandfather Clause. This has to have been an oversight. What's going to happen is Instructors who are gainfully employed on February 6th, 2022 will be unemployed the next day. How can this be? The Rule Change should state that on February 7th, 2022 anyone wishing to be an ELDT CDL A Instructor will have to meet the qualifications. Anyone already employed and functioning as an ELDT CDL A Instructor prior to February 7th, 2022 should not be affected by this Rule change. It seems to me the FMCSA is opening themselves up for a National Class Action Lawsuit for causing countless people to lose their jobs. For the sake of the FMCSA's image, reputation and public relations the FMCSA should probably expeditiously add the Grandfather Clause in to prevent loss of jobs and a large costly, reputation damaging Class Action Lawsuit.

When humans cross paths with vehicles or equipment, injuries and damage can occur. The legal liability is also problematic, since a devastating accident is always just one careless moment away.
DOT should encourage commercial gate, door and loading dock users to install any practical safety devices that reduce liability and probability of mishap. One simple widely-used option is LED safety light systems. Durable LED light strips can be attached to barrier gate arms, swing or slide gates, commercial door frames, and loading docks. Those lights can change color depending on the safety profile of the moment. Green light universally conveys a safe situation, whereas Red or Amber light generally indicates danger or caution.
Current gate lighting at railroad crossings and highway express-lane closure gates are difficult to see, for example. The cost to install or improve safety lighting is trivial compared to the risk of injury and the legal liability.
Every gate and door should be lighted for safety.

What strategies or priorities should DOT adopt to achieve the Department’s strategic goals and objectives? 

Use this Decision Making Model:

SAFETY, is it Safe?, should be the first question asked.
COMMUNITY, if it's safe then, is it good for the Community, State, Nation, and World?
OPERATING PROCEDURES, are applicable Local, State, Federal, and World Laws, Rules, and Regulations met and being followed.  


How should DOT measure progress towards those priorities?

Reduction in Single Occupancy Vehicles, Reduction in Fuel Consumption, Reduction in Pollution, and the improvement quality of life for all users.


What emerging challenges or opportunities in transportation warrant additional DOT activities or investments?

With concern over environmental laws and restrictions, including but not limited to Air Traffic we must look for opportunities to take advantage of and improve our fixed guideway transportation system (freight/passenger) and design a system that promotes multimodal conveyance. Kind of like ""All Roads Lead To Rome"" where all Roads lead to transportation opportunities. Without Transportation - Nothing Happens!


How can DOT best coordinate its activities with Federal, State, local, Tribal, labor, private sector, academic, non-profit, international and other partners?

Communication is number 1! Everyone Looks at ""What's In It For Me"". Have a plan that will show how it will benefit the community, state, nation, and world safely and efficiency using the best available technology that is reasonable, cost effective and a good value.


How can DOT best utilize additional programs and authorities in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to accomplish the goals laid out in the strategic plan?

If it's Safe, If it's Good, and If applicable Local, State, Federal, and World Laws, Rules, and Regulations are met and being followed, no one will be able to argue against it. No reasonable person and/or group would argue against what is good and safe for the people. Everything should be made public - Again Communicate. We must continually improve or we become stagnate, vulnerable, and stymied in helping those around us progress. ",,,,,,,

Private rail operators like Brightline are pioneering the latest era of high-speed intercity rail travel in the United States. The DOT should support and encourage potential private operators to build out and run high-speed corridors as an alternative to air travel. State DOTs should be involved in collaborations between rail operators and the U.S. DOT to determine how best to quickly and affordably build out high-speed corridors. Hyperloop is a fantasy that shouldn't be seriously considered at this juncture. 

The majority of many suburban communities note a lack of sidewalks, bike lanes, or convenient active transportation access to buildings/facilities as a major compliant. The DOT needs to work with state DOTs and local governments to implement funding plans and incentives to rebuild streets that prioritize ped/bike travel, and incentives for localities to adopt form-based codes and eliminate off-street parking requirements.",,,,,,,

Each year about 350 people die, and thousands of others are injured, in automobile accidents caused by wrong-way drivers. Drive-tron is a software laser scanner apparatus, that’s specifically designed to detect and to reduce the speed of wrong way drivers on a freeway or double lane highway.
The software scanner system will be created and designed to detect all opposite facing traffic signs and symbols.  Opposite facing traffic signs are the images that one would see if he or she was driving on the wrong side of the road; Such as the back view of the stop sign or traffic light, or the backside of the speed limit sign, or the opposite facing pavement turning arrows.
To achieve its objective, the software scanner system will employee one or two scan heads, along with a kill switch for reducing the speed of the engine. The sensor apparatus will be attached to the center front (inside/outside) of the vehicle with a daytime scanning range of 42ft. horizontally and 80 to 120 ft. vertical.
Due to the loss of visibility after dark ranges will be altered.  For after dark hours, the concept creator envisions the ranges to be 24ft horizontal and 80 to 120 vertical, also night time scanning ranges should rest at the 3 o’clock mark.  The controlled invisible laser beam system may require the use of a laser rangefinder.
Important note:  Recognition of the DO NOT ENTER or the WRONG WAY sign, will prompt the immediate activation of the system.  Meaning the system would turn the lights off, the emergency signal on, and kill the power to the engine.
The system will be of a continuous run nature; it will activate and deactivate with the turning on or off of the ignition. The design of the system will better serve the general public by protecting them from wrong-way drivers.  All final dimension and specification will be determined by those trained in the field of laser technology. For the safety of the general public, autonomous vehicle should possess such technology as well.

How will it work?
The scanning of two opposite facing traffic objects, will serve as an indication to the system itself that a motorist is driving in the wrong direction. Upon detecting that a motorist is driving in the wrong direction, the system within two hundred feet of additional driving, will turn the lights off, the emergency signal on, and kill the power to the engine. 

Claims:
1.	Method of claim:  A method whereby a computer software program consists of opposite facing traffic and roadway signs/symbols.

2.	Method of claim:  A laser beam scanner comprised: of a beam, scanning, distance, and control device that interlinks with said traffic software.

3	Method of claim:  A method whereby said software and laser scanner interconnects with a kill switch in order to reduce the speed of a vehicle.
 
4	Method of claim: A method whereby said software and laser scanner turns off the head lights, activate the emergency signals, and downgrade the power of the engine.

5	Method of claim: A method whereby said program is able to reboot itself with the short passage of time.

Field of background:
Wrong way driving is the leading cause of head on collision.  About 350 people die, and thousands of others are injured, each year in the United States as a result of automobile accidents caused by wrong-way drivers on highways, including those driving the wrong way on highway ramps.  
Summary of concept:
For all concerned, the idea addresses the need for a more predictable out come when encountering wrong- way drivers. Upon detecting that a motorist is driving in the wrong direction, and to ensure that the RIGHT driver maintains his or her visibility at night, drive-tron will simultaneously #1.  Turn off the head lights of the WRONG driver, #2. Activate his/her emergency signal, and #3. Reduce the power to the engine; resulting in a more favorable out-come for all involved.

If we re-envision the vehicle as a module, we can practically harness available technology and greatly improve transit.

Modularity is inherently responsive to demand. It reduces congestion, crashes, and trip-time. Energy consumption is more efficient and drivers don’t lose time while driving (if they don’t want to).

NEXT Future Transportation Inc. proposes a modular, electric, public transportation vehicle that revolutionizes the way we get around.
 
Instead of a single car, my “pod” joins up with other pods already moving, I'm prompted to move to my destination module, which then detaches and drops me off.
 
Taxi joins into a bus..I switch seats…the bus separates back to a taxi.

We can expand road capacity by 33%, reduce delivery time by 50%, and cut road congestion by 80%...all while utilizing existing infrastructure.

Traffic congestion is those “other people” getting somewhere and, as individuals, we don’t move efficiently in our single car. An interchangeable modular public vehicle works because there is an accessible, ubiquitous, and less expensive transit option available. It’s just more efficient.
 
A gain in efficiency is a “value add” for owners of capital AND individuals. If we do transit better, it enables positive social, environmental, and economic change.
 
This technology is relevant for a large consortium of stakeholders and generates near universal interest.

————
Next is a 'swarm vehicle', that greatly outperforms conventional transportation when used in conjunction with other modules. Its strength lies in its considerably greater room for optimization compared to conventional cars. A swarm of Next modules improves traffic fluidity, commute time, running costs and pollution prevention by optimizing each module occupancy rate, while being backed by solid design choices.

————

NEXT Future Transportation was founded by Tommaso Gecchelin and is engaged in the EU. We have requested a vehicle interpretation from NHTSA (Fall 2021), and we are a US company incorporated in Delaware.
There are many regulatory issues to address as this type of vehicle does not yet exist.

As long as there is a, “I’ll believe it when I see it” ethos, the promise and potential of modularity languishes. We believe modularity satisfies ALL 6 of the DOT Strategic Framework’s goals (as spelled out in your RFC). This paradigm would greatly benefit from institutional traction (pun intended) from US DOT.

Thank you.

When space becomes more and more limited, emphasis should be shifted to model the whole transportation system, suggesting solutions to reduce congestion by shifting some people to public transportation (buses, trains). Multi-modal traffic simulation must be adopted and/or emphasize its importance to suggest improvements to the road system, in order to reduce congestion and plan for future demands to avoid road network collapse. 

• Climate & Sustainability:  Traffic multi-modal simulation currently becomes even more important as combustion engine cars still dominate the vehicle space. The study of urban mobility should be stressed as it considers how people get to their destination by all modes: car, buses, trains, walking, taxis, ubers, lyfts, cycling, etc. Results for microsimulation calculate benefits combining time saved but most importantly, distance and stops saved. These last two benefits contribute to shorter distances and fewer stops resulting in Less Fuel Consumption and Lower CO2 Emissions helping Climate and Sustainability of Cities/Counties. DOT's must also be immediately prepared for the indisputable fact related to Electric Vehicles in the short and mid term future. Electric Vehicles are a reality and will continue to grow exponentially as they are cleaner for the planet and the environment and help save on fuel and maintenance costs.

• Transformation:  As Electric Vehicles are now a reality, DOT's should be ready to transform and build a proper charging infrastructure to accommodate high EV demand as adoption forecasts create massive demand for charging stations throughout the entire road network system.

Particularly for large, oversize loads. These loads can not use the average truck stop. They end up having to use exit ramps or vacant lots which causes safety concerns to not just the load, but the motoring public. Give tax breaks to truck stop owners wishing to expand. Open more rest areas.

Address driver's education on how to drive around trucks. Get rid of hand held devices of any kind. There are many accidents due to inattentive drivers of all kinds of vehicles. Levy stiff fines. Distracted driving should have same penalties as drunk driving.

Fix the delays at shippers and receivers. The average driver looses 20 hours per week due to delays. This would fix the supply chain issues.

Create known heavy haul routes across the country such as they have in Canada.

Everyone walks -- or rolls in their wheelchair.  For at least part of their journey.  Yet many roads and streets around the country are designed entirely for cars and trucks.  This causes many people to purchase, maintain, and use a car to do simple trips within walking distance.  It kills people who cannot afford to do so, as they walk down rural roads with no sidewalks, high speed limits, and poor visibility, and get hit by motor vehicles.

Historically, it was understood that roads were for people.  They were taken over by cars in a documented series of events.  In some places, sidewalks were built to restore travel options for people.  In some places, roads were designed with lower speed limits to enable cars and people to coexist.  In many other places, neither of these things were done -- and car-dependency was created.  And carnage ensued.

DOT must stop funding projects which build roads for cars and trucks with no associated or parallel facilities for humans.  The strategic plan must put humans first.

DOT should measure progress by measuring percentage of the route network which can be traversed by humans in wheelchairs safely without a car.  ""Safely"" will require further definition, but your average 55 mph rural road with no sidewalks isn't safe to walk.

This is crucial for Safety, Equity, Climate & Sustainability, and is key to Transformation.  Yet it has never made it into a strategic plan.  Put Humans First.",,,,,,,

Climate and Sustainability - I am concerned that replacing internal combustion engines with electric vehicles is the only objective for reducing our vehicle emissions. An electric vehicle is still a vehicle. The electricity still has to be generated, the vehicle has to be manufactured, and congestion will still be a problem. The solution to congestion in most places is to build more roads, which is in itself a very carbon intensive process and is a poor use of valuable land. As a nation we have shied away from what is really needed which is behavior change. We must reduce our VMT and make it possible for people to lead productive lives without owning a car at all.

Whatever policies are adopted, more effort needs to be made to include making roads safe & accessible for non motorized users, such as creating separate pathways from motorized users, connecting those pathways so that their are routes that people can actually use, & that are maintained at least to the level of motorized routes & do not just become spaces to dump trash & snow. Doing this makes sure that roads are part of livable communities. 

Given that electric vehicles are becoming more widely used, developing that infrastructure makes sense too.

Especially when it comes to transportation dollars, I would like to request that Worcester County and the Worcester County Board of Supervisors get an equal seat at the table.  The City of Worcester does not have an elected Mayor to speak out for the City, so it is ignored.  In the 10 years I have lived here I can not remember one visit by a Senator, nor any announcements of federal dollars outside of the airport.  But Worcester is the 2nd largest city in the state of MA!  Home to 7 universities, a major medical school, an extremely large CSX train yard (plus MTA and Amtrak, so there are multiple railroad bridges and crossings in need of major overhaul), and the city sits at the head of the Blackstone River Corridor, an historical and environmentally important river that leads directly to the Port of Providence (RI).  Worcester has a large working class community and a great many of these people don't drive- instead many, many residents take the bus so how about some funds for electric buses?  Worcester is a challenge to drive in and park in because the streets are a maze of one-way streets and serious pot holes- a perfect candidate for the Smart Streets program.  And roundabouts!  Next door to Worcester is the Town of Shrewsbury, which has a huge UPS distribution center, the intersections of rt 140 and rt 20 are a sea of constant brown vans.  I just ask that somebody ask ""hey what about Worcester County"" to officials at MassDoT and continue to ask them, because ""business as usual"" will not benefit Central Mass.",,,,,,,

SANDAG supports the U.S. DOT strategic goals as outlined in the Strategic Plan framework and is pleased to see such direct alignment with California’s and the San Diego region’s goals.  

SANDAG supports the Organizational Excellence goal of “establishing policies, processes, and an inclusive and innovative culture to effectively serve communities and responsibly steward the public’s resources.”  As such, we encourage further progress in the application of “one voice” on National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) clearance for projects.  While we appreciate previous efforts, more work is needed. For example, grantees delivering rail projects that serve regional and interregional passenger services as well as freight services often fund projects with a combination of Federal Transit Administration and Federal Railroad Administration funding.  On occasion, the entity with the funding for environmental clearance is the only entity that participates in NEPA. When funding changes for final design, we are often delayed because pre-award authority is not applied to the other entities funding for final design. These types of issues cause duplication of effort and unnecessary delays in delivering critical projects. 

Additionally, SANDAG suggests that the Strategic Plan prioritize safety and provide financial resources for public agencies to invest in quickbuild infrastructure solutions that enhance safety for people using transit and active transportation options. Quickbuild infrastructure solutions include temporary or semi-permanent materials (e.g., paint, bollards) which offer an interim solution for protecting public safety while long-term capital projects are being considered or are under development. 

Furthermore, consider adding the element of “reuse” to federal grant program requirements. In order to ensure greatest return on investment and see maximum effectiveness of grant funded projects, grant applicants should demonstrate how they are leveraging and reusing lessons learned from other programs nationwide that have proven to be successful and can be replicated to ensure maximum results. Alternatively, applicants can learn from less successful projects to avoid replicating past mistakes.

Lastly, In addition to advancing sustainable transportation system infrastructure, SANDAG encourages US DOT to offer grant opportunities that provide funding for the operation of transportation beyond traditional transit services, including on-demand mobility services such as micromobility, rideshare, microtransit, and last mile delivery options.

The plan can be viewed on the first page of solutionaryrail.org. this is the fastest decarbonization plan for America and has great potential to cut pollution in long-needed remediation areas such as transportation depots in cities where health effects are high. Shipping congestion would also improve with coordination of increased rail everywhere, carrying out the common carrier obligations of the freight industry which is overdue. Trapped wind power in the midwest can be utilized and carried to the coasts by electrifying passenger and freight via catenary and buried high-voltage DC renewable energy cable on portions of the rail corridor instead of continuing the madness of transportation money going almost completely to ever more highways to further damage them, our health, our atmosphere. The ATA, Rail and other industries assume that these incorrect paths will continue to be taken however if the public is presented with better options that's what they want every time. 
I agree with other individuals comments such as Dot setting up local and State offices to help coordinate better planning, including much more ground transportation (not necessarily public! I know people say public when there needs to be partnering with private, they just don't think about that)
These rather than corporate-driven decimation of forests, natural habitat, and waterways by every company that pretends jobs will come and have precedence over any other issue. ",,,,,,,

Safety: Policing measures in transit systems produce disparate impact on communities of color.  We believe the DOT should examine and promote meaningful solutions.  DOT might also add a specific objective.  For example: Race & Disability Conscious Safety: Decrease disparate impact of transportation policing strategies and increase attention to mental health and other social needs of the riding public.  DOT can play the role of promoting and organizing strategies similar to BART’s ambassador program by holding up best practices and supporting through any applicable competitive grant programs.  

Economic Strength and Global Competitiveness: A transit operator shortage is preventing transit agencies across the country from restoring service to pre-covid levels and damaging our ability to get ridership back to where it needs to be.  It threatens implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure plan, and if passed elements of Build Back Better.  We suggest that DOT add an objective such as: Transportation Jobs: Boost recruitment, training, hiring, retention and the number of good paying jobs that move both the riding public and goods and services.  DOT’s role could include convening senior officials from Labor, Education and DOT to look to targeting federal funds to ensuring an expansion of educational and apprenticeship opportunities to recruit and train operators. DOT could also examine and promote best practices used by transit agencies to make for good paying, safe and rewarding transportation jobs.  This should be measured in real numbers by looking at the extent to which the shortage improves or worsens. 

Equity:  Determining what policies and investments really work to improve equity is not an easy task. DOT can promote the use of access-to-destination analysis.  Also, DOT should consider editing the goal statement to add the word measurable and consider adding an objective such as: 
Smart Measurements:  Support the implementation of systems and analysis that better measures transit’s ability to connect people with the destinations they value. 

We also suggest strengthening the “Expanding Access” objective by making specific mention of fares as a barrier. DOT can help transit agencies and local government implement low-income and other discount fare programs that are easy for riders to apply for and use.

DOT can strengthen the “Power of Community” objective by speaking more directly to the role of DOT itself.  DOT might affirm your intention to look for and work with local government for opportunities to revise local rules and governance structures in order to support expanded public participation. 

DOT can strengthen the “Interventions” objective by making specific mention of the intersection of transit and affordable housing, such as:  Highlight the importance of coordinating high-quality transit with affordable housing and other measures that combat displacement

Climate and Sustainability:    There is a wide underappreciation for the role transit investment can make to reduce GGH emissions. There is a need for broad public education. We believe the problem warrants an objective such as:  Education: Design and implement a national public education campaign designed to expand knowledge of the climate benefits of expanding and increasing frequency of mass transit. Additionally, the agency can put some teeth into this goal by adding language to the “Climate Culture” such as:  Incorporate climate-informed decision making into federal programs, as well as in the federal government's oversight of regional and state transportation projects.  One example of how that might work would be reviewing MPO transportation models, state laws and constitutions that are barriers to sustainable transportation investment, and paying special scrutiny to highway expansions that have the potential to harm public health in environmental justice communities.

I wish to comment on the Department of Transportation’s strategic plan. As a long time advocate and Transportation  Advisory Council Chair  serving Great Falls and north central Montanans with disabilities, seniors  ,and as   public transportation user a s well as a person with a mobility and visual disability, I can tell you that I am very excited and  pleased to comment on this strategic plan. Many  of the questions asked by the Department  of Transportation  are seeking to advance not only climate sustainable transportation technology but  also advance future transportation technology and  goals. The challenges that rural and frontier states  face ,like Montana ,involve modernization  of our existing infrastructure while also adapting to future needs and climate and other sustainable technology. As a person with a disability who utilizes Montana’s  public transportation  systems  and services,
I can assure you that we need to focus on connectivity, funding ,modernization and future technologies that may enhance disabilities  accessibility  for all Montanans and for all frontier residents   of the United States.We need to employ strategies that will enhance coordination in connectivity of our transportation services.  The Department  of Transportation  must work with small urban , rural, and frontier providers and community developers of our public  high way and  sidewalks infrastructure to ensure not only that existing public needs are taken in to account, but  future needs  as  well! Sometimes, when I advocate for  north central Montanans with disabilities and transportation  needs I feel that many systems are struggling to meet current needs and  because of  this can not looking forward into the future. This may be because no state’s infrastructure is  ever perfect  .  As an agency ,I would hope that DOT would help and assist all  states  and transportation  providers of all transportation   on making their  fleets  mobility and   sensory 
accessible as we do need to be looking to the future .I would hope that DOT  and the AccesBoard  would  implement ideas outlined in the  report :Inclusive Design  of Autonomous Vehicles : APublic Dialogue  This technology could benefit not only autonomous vehicles but 
  future  electrical vehicles technology so that people with disabilities can access those technologies. I am hopeful that many grants  for  funding will adopt best practices of comparable areas so that states and systems can benefit from the information sharing.  For rural  and frontier areas Essential Air
Service  is vital as is
Amtrack.We need to ensure that those airports are also receiving modernization and best practice guidances not only accessible  services but also practices to expand services in  rural and  frontier areas.
For pedestrians,I am hopeful that DOT will continue and expand upon the work of Safe Transportation   for Every  Pedestrian planning    well as  Vision Zero   and Complete   Street plans not only on the federal level but also the state and local level .I am excited also  that PROWAG   guidance is coming out in   2022 . The DOT and HHS need to ensure that people with disabilities can remain as mobile and active in our communities as possible particularly after disasters transportation including medical and non-emergency medical transportation  can assist communities in these efforts and I hope do you see this discussed
Enhancing equitability and equity involves not only land-use planning as well sustainable business  practices but also understanding that cultural significance is highly important for communities who are  BIOPC. This means people and communities should not only be utilizers of transit but also planners of transit and designers and champions of transportation projects and the  wider communities they serve as a whole.Thank you for allowing me to submit comments on behalf of the DOT strategic plan.

The Honorable Secretary Pete Buttigieg
U.S. Department of Transportation 
1200 New Jersey Ave., S.E.
Washington, DC  20590

RE: Docket No. DOT-OST-2021-0140

Dear Secretary Buttigieg:

Zync respectfully submits the following comments in response to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (USDOT) draft Strategic Plan. Zync supports DOT’s plan to create a safer, cleaner, more efficient, and more equitable transportation system for all Americans. Zync welcomes the opportunity to provide comments on how USDOT’s Strategic Plan can ensure motor vehicle safety as new technologies are introduced, while also providing sufficient flexibility to foster innovation in both convenience and safety features.

Zync is a Porsche-backed automotive software company building the future of in-vehicle experiences. We believe the increased digitization and electrification of vehicles presents incredible opportunities to transform the way we think about transportation. Our mission is to deliver the benefits of these new experiences safely, efficiently, and equitably across all demographics. 

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provides unprecedented funding for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. This funding, combined with the auto industry’s continued push towards electrifying more and more of their vehicles, will go beyond only making America’s transportation ecosystem cleaner and more efficient. The electrification of consumer vehicles and evolving demographic of car buyers is creating a paradigm shift in how automakers differentiate themselves from their competitors and market their vehicles to consumers. With focus on powertrain decreasing and a demographic of consumers accustomed to digital experiences at their fingertips increasing, automakers are now focusing on building the most compelling infotainment systems and digital experiences. As cars emerge as the next great media and entertainment platform, we will soon see features like streaming video content, gaming, e-commerce and targeted advertising as a way for brands to reach new audiences. 

Zync applauds US DOT’s commitment to study and research how driver monitoring systems (DMS) can enhance driver focus and curb distracted driving as a part of the IIJA. As automakers race to develop and implement Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), it is imperative that critical steps are taken to ensure drivers do not become over-reliant on these technologies to execute critical safety measures. As large infotainment screens become the norm and vehicles’ capabilities begin to look increasingly similar to our smartphones, ensuring proper and safe engagement with these new features is critical to the safety of all road users.

USDOT should prioritize the study and research of DMS, ADAS, and other occupant monitoring systems (OMS). These technologies have the capability to save lives on America’s roads on a timeline that is realistically foreseeable. As vehicles become more engaging to their occupants through the infotainment system, USDOT should also prioritize how apps and other services are being presented to consumers while the vehicle is in motion. Bespoke applications tailored to the in-vehicle use are considered key to ensure a high degree of safety and usability. Ported web apps, initially developed for the mobile phone or the TV, that are too complex and not intuitive to the vehicle’s situation can have deadly consequences, as has been seen in recent high-profile accidents now under investigation by NHTSA. We encourage NHTSA to focus on updating the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) with increased emphasis on DMS, ADAS, OMS and infotainment in order to identify potential safety risks with these new systems, and to ensure that consumers are the driving force behind the adoption of these new technologies.

USDOT should emphasize creating consistent messaging and terminology for the aforementioned systems to ensure that the public is properly educated and aware of the features, capabilities, and other risks. Larger, more intuitive screens in the vehicle provide the perfect medium for automakers to continually educate their consumers on these systems. USDOT should collaborate with OEMs, Tier 1s, Tier 2s, technology companies, the private sector, and advocacy groups, to develop this messaging.

Thank you again for the opportunity to provide comments on these very important topics. If your office should have any questions regarding this submission, please contact Will Simon, Director of Business Development and Policy at will@zync.com. 

Sincerely, 

Will Simon
Director of Business Development and Policy

Docket No. DOT-OST-2021-0140
U.S. DOT Strategic Plan
ACTION: Notice of Request for Public Comment (RFC)

Dear Sirs,
My name is Roumen Markov and I’m the General manager of Large Infrastructure Projects LLC - a developer of projects in the field of transport infrastructure and water management.
Most of our transport projects are related to infrastructure development in Europe but in the last two years we are developing the Motorways of the oceans project.    Its main goal is the creation of streamlined and efficient ocean born and sea born container transport, which to provide:
1.	Predictable conditions such as time, price and carbon footprint for all players in the maritime container business.
2.	Low and zero GHG emissions from transportation of containers.
3.	Reducing the costs for transportation of containers
4.	Termination of congestions in ports, container terminals and hinterland
5.	Reducing the time for the goods delivery
6.	Discontinuing the ""race"" for reconstruction of canals, rivers, ports and container terminals to call and operate larger and deeper-going container vessels
     The elements of the project are:
-	New technologies in shipping, including electrically driven ships without crew;
-	New technologies for the container terminals, which are relevant to the new ships and which secure fast processing of the ships, the containers and the hinterland;
-	Building of new and reconstruction of existing terminals and for the first ones there are three important requirements – 1. the place 2. the place 3. the place;
-	On the basis of the new ships and the new container terminals – optimization of the lines.
  Through the combination of the elements we can reach the goals of the project.
  At a conceptual level we have developed ships as follows:
-	for intercontinental lines, container vessels with a capacity of 42 500 TEU
-	non-traditional by capacity feeders for 10 000 TEU and 4 000 TEU
-	the conventional size of feeders – 2 000 TEU, 1 000 TEU, 750 TEU, 500 TEU
 All the feeders are electrically driven and without crew (remotely controlled and autonomous). 
 On the basis of the traffic analysis and forecasts we have developed in details the routes of the overseas lines in the regions of East Asia, in the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, North Europe and the Baltic Sea, the Eastern and Western coasts of USA.  
Worldwide the project envisaged the development of 9 new hubs for transshipment of containers: 2 in Asia; 5 in Europe and 2 in North America.
Due to the short period of time, in which we were supposed to send our comments on the draft DOT Strategic Framework with the draft strategic goals and strategic objectives to be included in the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Strategic Plan for fiscal years (FY) 2022-2026, we send hereby attached the presentation of the Motorways of the oceans project and the brief information about each project for the container hubs, including the ones to be developed in the USA. 
Having in mind the current problems with the congestions at the West Coast ports and the situation with the development of the East Cost ports, we are convinced that our project proposals are the perfect solution and we hope to be taken into consideration when finalizing the Strategic plan of DOT for fiscal years 2022-2026.

I urge federal transportation officials to better support, through funding and professional resource supports, regional coordination between and among suburban and semi-urban governmental agencies to provide practical, cost-competitive alternatives for regional daily commuters who travel between five and thirty-five miles for their jobs. 

I have observed that there are good opportunities for single local governmental agencies to pursue federal grant dollars for local projects. State transportation officials are skilled at pursuing money for intrastate projects, and for projects that impact interstate travel. But for regional travel changes, and projects aimed at mode shifting away from SOV travel, it appears that local governments are often in competition with neighbors, when the best solutions are likely to be shared approaches and incentives common across a multi-jurisdictional area. We should be subsidizing and prioritizing regional VMT reduction strategies, rather than pitting small governments against one another with schemes that charge or incentivize drivers based on where they start or end their trip, instead of taking their entire daily/weekly/monthly travel impacts into account. Federal grant opportunities that foster regional solutions, and uniform incentives across city and county lines to reduce less efficient, more harmful travel patterns, would yield a net benefit to states. It is a missed opportunity that should be addressed. ",,,,,,,

A more resilient, accessible, equitable and sustainable economy requires an infrastructure that is primed to amplify those values. 

Sadly, over the past four decades, economic globalization and transportation deregulation each amplified the other in a positive feedback loop with extremely negative consequences. The result is that many were literally and figuratively “left behind.” This is increasingly attributed as a cause for the current rise of negative populism and the dangerous level of political polarization. It is time to return and expand reasonable, reliable, accessible, clean and affordable rail service for passengers and freight. 

The attached Moonshot Modeshift (MSMS) paper was submitted by Solutionary Rail (SR) to the Select Committee on the Climate in 2020. Today, we offer it to the USDOT to inform its strategic planning.  MSMS describes the multiple public interests served by an aggressive ""moonshot"" shift of North American freight off of roads and onto tracks. In contrast to the modest mode shift often mentioned in passing by the Association of American Railroads our recommendation is  proportionate to the climate crisis and other public's interests. It describes potential obstacles and opportunities for policy makers to address them. 

Also attached is Solutionary Rail's recent sign on letter to STB Chair Martin Oberman. This letter, signed by over 135 groups and individual leaders updates the Solutionary Rail position with some key regulatory suggestions for addressing the four decade lapse in oversight of corporate controlled railroad infrastructure. We ask for further leadership to clarify and update the common carrier obligations of the class 1 railroads to serve 21st-century public interests, revoke service and commodity exemptions, and emphasizes the critical need for the USDOT and partner agencies to collaborate to build a tool for characterizing/calculating the external costs of freight transport as described in our mock-up/prototype External Cost Calculator available at http://SolutionaryRail.org/extcostcalc 

The US public, planners and policy makers would be well served if the USDOT would draw inspiration from the EU's 2019 External Costs of Transport Handbook, apply formulas on wear and tear, emissions, safety, congestion, noise, tire pollution etc. to FAF/waybill/and other other data to characterize the current costs/true costs of how we move people and freight, but especially freight. Solutionary Rail submitted a comment with more detail on the above, i.e. Comment ID DOT-OST-2021-0106-0387 in response to a request for comments regarding supply chain resilience. (Also attached) 

The Solutionary Rail project is eager to work with USDOT to help align its values, vision and strategy. The new Freight Research body and Undersecretary position offer opportunities to make sure public interest advocates have a seat at the table. 

Thank you for this opportunity to submit comments.
