This comment is regarding the issue of selecting a EAS carrier for the Cape Yakataga, Icy Bay area.

It is my understanding that two carriers have submitted proposals, Alsek Air and Copper River Air Taxi.

We have been dealing with Les Hartley of Alsek Air for many years.  He is an honest and reliable person, who goes out of his way to accommodate his customers.

The advantages of service to and from Yakutat are:
Yakutat has an airport with two Alaska Air flights a day. 
The main advantage to service from Yakutat is the weather, which is generally better than the weather to and from Cordova.

We have done business with Larry Hancock of Copper River Air Taxi several times.  From what we know he is also honest and reliable.

The advantages of service to and from Cordova are:
Cordova has a hospital.
More weekly flights out of Cordova via Alaska Air and ERA.
Cordova also has year round ferry service.
There are more hotels in Cordova.
There are no large waterbodies to fly over.

The disadvantage of service to and from Cordova:
The weather can sometimes be a problem.

After reading the proposals, I believe that they are all good.

I greatly appreciate the efforts to establish a reliable EAS service.

The important matters that should be handled and revised are:
	Collectors should have proper training to detect any mishap or mistake that may happen in the testing process.  
	Drug and Testing Forms and Materials should be stated in both English and in foreign form.  This way if there is any question, the forms cover all angles of miscommunication or misunderstanding. 
	Collection Process should understand that someone may not be able to produce urine on demand and they should give three hours for them to be able to produce it.  These people should not be allowed to leave the organization or premises.  
	Directly Observed and Monitored Collections should be limited.  The direct observation will violate the privacy act and I believe it is Unconstitutional.  However, I do not see how monitoring someone is violating any privacy.
	Adulterated, Substituted, and Dilute Tests should not be ignored.  If a persons test is suspected of having any of these, the person should be requested to retake the test.  If they refuse, there should be appropriate measures taken.  Perhaps if one refuses then the organization/company will give them one month suspension and upon returning they must past the test.

Los Angeles, Denver, Phoenix and Seattle are each much easier entry points for a terrorist or terrorist sympathizer to board a plane and head for the primary Al-Queda target : Washington D.C. 
 
Their desire to strike the White House, FBI Headquarters, the Washington Monument, or the Lincoln Memorial exponentially rivals their commitment to attack the World Trade Center. These flights should be tracked from take-off to landing, air-marshalled, passenger-screened, or cancelled. 
 
Al-Queda (and DOZENS of other fundamentalist groups) still think they can take control of a plane with a handful of Muslim-Americans sympathetic to islamic resentments.
 
And the preference given to new carriers or new nonstop service to small hub or non-hub airports is particularly unwise. New carriers will have lax, less-experienced security; as will small hub and non-hub airports. This is a weakness sure to be probed and/or exploited by islamic extremist organizations.

I wholeheartedly endorse the new provisions with respect to the substituted criteria, and the provision for recollection under direct observation of dilute specimens with creatinine levels greater than 2 mg/dl but less than 5 mg/dl. 

However, I would encourage you to consider eliminating the dilute-negative category consisting of specimens with creatinine levels greater the 5 mg/dl but less than 20 mg/dl. I believe that this category causes confusion and is unnecessary given the new dilute-recollect category. 

Sincerely,

Ref. EAS Community Participation

Dear Chief DeVany:

In the economic development arena, air service is an essential marketing tool used in the recruitment of new business and industry and the overall development and growth, especially for a smaller community.  As the lead economic development agency for Northwest Alabama, we are constantly asked accessibility questions for the community, specifically the proximity to a local, commercial airport.  The Northwest Alabama Regional Airport, located in Muscle Shoals, Colbert County, Alabama, offers not only Northwest Alabama but also Northeast Mississippi and Southwest Tennessee an opportunity to qualify for numerous site selection searches for growing companies.  

The entire Shoals Area, which includes the cities of Florence, Muscle Shoals, Sheffield, and Tuscumbia, and the counties of Lauderdale and Colbert, understands the importance of transportation and accessibility in developing and growing the community.  A new 450-acre industrial park is currently under development on property adjacent to the Northwest Alabama Regional Airport.  Commercial air service in close proximity to this park will accentuate the community¿s modes of transportation to companies searching for locations.  

Northwest Alabama has been fortunate to have local airport facilities, and we feel that continued air service is vital to the community¿s growth.  The Northwest Alabama Regional Airport presently serves the tri-state area with direct commuter service twice daily to Memphis via Mesaba Airlines, Inc., a Northwest Airlink code-shares affiliate of Northwest Airlines.  The limited number of flights in and out of the area makes it difficult to schedule travel.  An increase in the number of flights per day would increase the daily boarding numbers, allowing personal and business travel to be scheduled in a much more effective manner.   

In your evaluation of communities, we hope that Northwest Alabama will continue to be a community that will receive the benefits offered through the Essential Air Service (EAS) Program.

							Best regards,



							Forrest Wright
							Exe. Director

disability in air travel

comment on page l4 of 74 - what is the penalty if the
carrier does not have a copy of the policy available
for the disabled person to see. I think the financial
penalty should be $200,000.  There is no question it
should be there.  How do we make sure it is there if
the foreign carrier fails.  Also the document should
be available immediately - which means in ten minutes
not l0 hours of waiting.  

comment on page l5 - I think six months is maximum
feasible time for compliance with this proposal.  I
think disabled people should use the regular customer
service lines and that they do not need access to
kiosks. they need personal attention. this is an
overrreaching thought.  

comment on page l6- everyone, disabled or not, needs
to be subject to full security. disability is no
excuse from a security check.  

comment on page l7  - new aircraft should have more
accessible lanes on the aircraft. the laws now to not
even have enough room to turn around. you have to back
into the loo.  

comment on page l8 - i think airline wheelchairs
should be the ones used in the airport/airplane, et.c.
 Folding wheelchairs belong in baggage.  

I do not think waivers should be granted from this
requirement.  Everything should be spelled out in the
last paragraph on this page.  No private deals with
assistant general counsel - it leads to corruption and
graft money.  

comment on page l9 - first large para - there are so
few of these people that this is not necessary.  

comment on page 22 - comment on first para - maybe
passengers with disabilities need to use another
means. this is not a perfect world for anybody.  

comment on page 25 - if a foreign carrier fails to
make contact _ my answer is NO, they must make
contact. It is the responsibility of the airline. And
if they fail to do it penalty is $100,000.

comment on page 26 - i think 24-7 telephone service
should be available re para mid page.  

comment on page 27 - There should be animal relief
areas assigned by every single air terminal. If you
are going to allow animals to be carried on planes,
the airlines must make arrangements for this.  l4-l8
hour flights are a real problem. There are diapers for
most smaller animals.  Maybe that can be required.  

comment on page 37 - no waiver requests permitted.  no
special deals with certain people - it leads to
corruption.

As a blind individual who gets most of his information on various matters of interest through the web, it is critical to me that pricing, scheduling, sales information, in short, all important dynamic information provided by carriers via the web should be as accessible to me as it is to anyone else.  Given the current high state of sophistication of screen readers, which read web sites aloud to the blind, it is now completely reasonable to expect that carriers and their representatives can construct fully accessible web sites without in any way sacrificing functionality or look and feel.  Given this current ease of accessible design, I encourage the Agency, in its capacity as regulator, to adopt this paragraph fully.  In doing so, you will be adding to the quality of life of blind and disabled individuals everywhere, who rely on the web to provide them with salient life-enhancing information.  For blind people, the addition of paragraph B is a great boon and will truly enhance our lives.

Department of Transportation

Washington, DC 20590.

Docket Number OST-2004-19626-1

Dear Docket Clerk, 

As President of the International Association of Assistance Dog Partners, I want to thank the Department of Transportation for providing the opportunity to comment on the Notice of Proposed Rule making published in the Federal Register on November 4, 2004.  IAADP is a consumer advocacy organization with 2,000 disabled members working with guide, hearing and service dogs. IAADP shares with DOT the goal of eliminating all barriers to air travel for passengers with disabilities and guaranteeing no vestiges  of discrimination remain in the air travel industry. 

Many elements of the proposed rules go a long way toward meeting this goal.  In particular the mandate that foreign air carriers must meet the accessibility requirements of the ACAA and that all airline and air travel related companies must make their websites accessible to blind and visually impaired travelers using screen readers are welcome additions to existing regulations. 

In the proposed new rules, there are a number of issues raised that IAADP would like to comment on. 

1. One of the most vexing issues for IAADP assistance dog partner members and all passengers with disabilities traveling with assistance dogs is the suggestion that airlines may charge for an
additional seat if the service animal cannot fit in the floor space available, either in bulkhead or under the seat in front.  If airlines move in this direction, air travel by a class of disabled people will become unaffordable and have a direct and discriminatory impact on their freedom to travel by air.  

For a small number of disabled people teamed with assistance dogs, the nature of their disability has a direct impact on the size of the dog needed or the ability of a canine partner to fit
in the allotted space provided in the cabin.  

For those whose dogs provide support while walking or getting in and out of chairs, tall dogs are essential.  In some cases, these service dogs wearing harnesses with rigid short handles, are too large to fit in the allotted floor space in the cabin.  Some guide dogs are also too large to exclusively fit in the limited floor space in front of the blind passenger.

Where wheelchair pulling is an essential part of the service dog's trained tasks, large dogs may be required.

Some service dogs cannot fit in the space allotted because of the need to wear backpacks.  Such backpacks may contain medications required by the disabled partner during the flight, and because of the nature of the disability, the disabled passenger does not have access to the overhead compartment.  

All of these elements represent a small segment of the total population of passengers with disabilities traveling with assistance dogs, and accommodating their needs would not present an undue hardship to any air carrier.

Since carriers are generally placing more seats in the available cabin space, dogs who could in the past fit under the seat in front of the passenger with a disability are no longer able to do
so.  This trend limits the ability of passengers with disabilities from having their service animals occupy the floor space in front of them.  It is well known in the industry that the interior configuration of the aircraft can be modified.  In fact, during the last decade the trend has been to increase the number of seats and decrease the amount of space in front of and between seats, exacerbating the problem based by passengers with disabilities traveling with assistance dogs.

By suggesting that airlines may charge for an additional seat if the service animal intrudes into the neighboring passenger's space, DOT is violating basic principles of non-discrimination.  
In addition, 382.67  permits carriers to comply with the wheelchair storage requirement by using a strap kit across two or three seats to store the wheelchair and if other passengers are bumped they receive compensation equivalent to denied boarding. No mention in this rule is made of additional charges for the extra seats provided for wheelchair stowage.  Providing such an accommodation to the stowage of wheelchairs but not to the placement of service animals can be viewed as discrimination toward one class of disabled passengers.  382.11, Section 3 states: that whatever services are offered to one passenger must also be offered to disabled passengers.  If wheelchair users are offered additional seats for the stowage of their wheelchairs, then an equivalent accommodation should be made for assistance dog partners.  Providing additional space for mechanical assistive devices and denying additional space for live assistive devices, namely assistance dogs, is discriminatory.  Paralleling the language used in relation to wheelchair stowage, IAADP would like to suggest the following language be adopted:
      ""If other passengers are bumped because of a service animal, they receive compensation equivalent to denied boarding.""
  
The NPRM document states that it is considered an undue burden to furnish more than one seat per ticket or ask another passenger to share leg room with a service animal or providing a seat in a class of service other than the one the passenger purchased.  Why would asking another passenger to share leg room on a voluntary basis or shifting the passenger next to the service animal or the passenger with the service animal to a seat in another class of service be considered an undue burden?

To a certain extent, this question is addressed in 64393, right hand column, ""If the service animal does not fit, it should be relocated to another space in the cabin if possible in the same service class. If no single seat will accommodate you may offer the option of purchasing a second seat, traveling on a later flight or having the service animal travel in the cargo hold.""  IAADP considers these options unacceptable and discriminatory.

IAADP would like to see the following language adopted: ""you may offer the passenger sitting in a seat adjacent to the disabled passenger traveling with a large service animal a seat in the same class of service in another part of the cabin.  If no seats are available in that class of service, you may ask for a volunteer willing to occupy the seat next to the disabled passenger requiring sharing of leg room.  If no volunteer is forthcoming and seats are available in another class of service in another part of the cabin, you may ask the adjacent passenger or the disabled passenger to occupy a seat in that other class of service.""  

The NPRM states: ""The Department seeks comment on whether there should be any exceptions to this principle (e.g., when a documented medical condition would preclude a passenger traveling in the space available to passengers in coach, but the additional room in business or first class would permit the individual to travel).""  page 34.  IAADP would suggest that when the nature of the disability or medical condition requires an assistance dog unable to fit in the leg space provided in coach class, that the disabled passenger and the assistance dog be offered accommodation in business or first class.  Since such accommodation will only be offered in rare circumstances, this would not be an undue burden  or lead to abuse.

In summary, 382.13  states air carriers must modify their facilities to assure nondiscrimination.  The airplane is their facility.  The air carrier must modify its facility, the aircraft, to accommodate assistance dogs of all sizes.  In addition to dealing with facilities, the ACAA addresses the issues of programs, services and policies.  By adopting the IAADP recommendations proposed above, air carriers will avoid potential discriminatory behavior toward disabled passengers traveling with large assistance dogs.



2. 382.41 indicates information must be provided to a passenger by specific row and seat number and any limitations on storage capacity must include information concerning storage of passenger's assistive devices.  Since IAADP members' assistive devices are guide, hearing and service dogs, information about floor space in front of the selected seat should be made available to accommodate their particular assistive devices.  The suggested language: could describe the space in front of the disabled passenger's seat measures 3 feet from front to back and 2 feet from side to side.


3. In the current rules a disabled passenger may not be charged for extra baggage if the additional bags are used to transport medicines, wheelchairs or other mechanical equipment.  IAADP would like to see added to the list food and equipment required by the assistance dog.  Additional equipment could be a harness or second harness required for other assistance dog-related activities.  Although most dog food is available at pet food stores, the need to obtain food on arrival at a destination would present an undue burden on the disabled passenger.  Getting transportation to and from the pet food store and carrying a large bag of dog food back to a hotel or hospitality center for people with disabilities would be a hardship or burden.  These are living assistive devices, and without food they could not continue performing their assistive functions.

When my wife and I travel with our guide dogs, we bring their food, pills and dietary supplements with us in the luggage.  For a one to two week trip, this means adding another piece of luggage or loading existing luggage beyond the 50 pound domestic luggage weight for a single item.  Many other IAADP members face the same problem.   


4. IAADP agrees with DOT's recommendation  that pre-boarding should continue to be offered by airlines.  For those of us with assistance dogs, this policy provides the opportunity to settle the dog under the seat or in bulkhead before other passengers board.  Many IAADP members choose this option but airline staff must be aware this is a choice, not a mandate.


5. IAADP agrees that the air carrier's acknowledged commitment to providing meet and assist or escort services promptly or in a timely manner are commitments that are too vague and unspecific.  There should be a standard time after arrival for such services to be provided.  A reasonable waiting period based on current time frames for connecting flights is 10 minutes.  To make this recommendation work, some penalties for airline non-compliance should be instituted.  Another suggestion is that until the requested escort service arrives, an airline staff member stay with the disabled passenger until the connection is made.     


6. IAADP is part of a Task Force convened by the National Council on Disability dealing with the establishment of relief areas for assistance dogs at airports.  The Task Force recommendations are in the process of being submitted to DOT.  The goal is to establish relief areas within the protected perimeter of the airport so passengers with disabilities will not need to re-enter the terminal and repeat the process of going through the security check.  The relief areas need to be kept clean and maintained, contain a diversity of surfaces, be fully accessible for those
with a variety of disabilities and airport personnel, including gate agents, CROs and escorts must be aware of their location.  Using these facilities should be considered a desirable option and not a mandate. 


7. Several questions raised in the document need to be addressed:

1. ""What about long flights with service animals lasting 14-18 hours?""  

My wife and I flew from Atlanta to Capetown, South Africa, almost two years ago.  We were accompanied by our guide dogs in the cabin during the 14.5 hour flight.  The dogs had no difficulty waiting until we landed to urinate and defecate.  More recently, four IAADP board members flew from the west coast to Tokyo, a flight of 12 hours, to participate in the first Japan Assistance Dog Partners Conference.  None of the dogs had a problem remaining continent.  

Decisions about how long a service animal can fly in the cabin is one that should be left up to the disabled partner.  Raising this question in the NPRM gives the appearance of treating service
animal partners as incapable of making these decisions or choices.  It reminds me of a recent flight I took with my wife when a gate agent stated he would be the one to determine if our
guide dogs could fit comfortably under the seats we had selected. 


2. ""Should modifications be made to Appendix A, which is the guidance on service animals?""  

IAADP strongly recommends that emotional support animals be removed from the class and definition of service animals.  A fundamental element in the definition of service animals is task training.  This element is not part of the definition of emotional support animals.  Therefore, they should be treated as a separate class or category of animals permitted in the cabin of an aircraft.  

Since the current proposed rules will extend ACAA coverage to foreign airlines using United States airports, I believe this issue may become a point of conflict between ACAA regulations and those regulations established in the home countries of foreign air carriers.  By removing emotional support animals from service animals, this issue can be more effectively negotiated.   

3. ""Should a carrier have advance notice that an individual arriving at the airport requires escort service?""  

This suggestion has its limitations.  For a passenger with a disability to provide the escort service with an exact  time of arrival is impossible, since many airports are located in major metropolitan areas with corresponding traffic delays.  If the recommendation were adopted, how would DOT guarantee that the escort service would be available at the time agreed on?  Even today when notice is given about the need for escort service to connecting flights, the timely availability of this service remains a fundamental problem resulting in many complaints.

The current design practice is to maintain a distance of minimum 6 inches from the backrest to the most forward hard point of the endbay for passenger egress.  This figure should be the parameter fixed by the Rule for assessing the nondiscrimination for disable people.
