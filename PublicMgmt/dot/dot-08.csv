I was recently bumped from a flight, and the airline's next flight with an available 
seat would have gotten me to my destination after the meeting I was flying out to 
attend.  As such, I cancelled my flight, was reimburst for the ticket, and was 
offered a voucher for my 'troubles'.  I accepted the offer, not having any idea what 
my alternatives were.

Regardless of what changes you make with regards to adjusting the 
compensation to involuntarily bumped travelers (suggestion below), I think airlines 
should be required to verbally (not in fine print) inform bumped passengers of what 
their rights are given their situation.  Having read up on this after the fact, it is not 
too onerous of an ask on airlines.  For example, they should have told me I was 
entitled to $400 compensation (I'm assuming this means a $400 check), but was 
only offered a travel voucher for another ticket.

With regards to compensation: while I like the idea of an auction, whereby the 
airline would pay whatever it takes until all seats have been voluntarily given up to 
those who want to be on said flight; it would be far too onerous on airlines to 
execute, and would probably only increase the times it takes to load a plane.

I think a straight forward 100% of total ticket value for a 1-2 hr delay and 200% of 
ticket face value for a >2 hr delay, WITH NO CAPS, would be a very straight 
forward way to ensure passengers are adequately covered for their troubles.  This 
approach also ensures that you won't have to waste tax payers money revising 
the figures again in a few years after inflation has erroded the new caps, they'll 
automatically adjust as prices go up.

While some would object to this on the grounds that airlines will then prioritize 
highest paying customers over lower paying, it has two benefits: 1) it aligns with 
the airlines priority of maximizing profit by minimizing losses and 2) people are 
paying for convenience; if it is communicated at the time of purchase that cheaper 
tickets are more likely to face a 'bump' than more expensive tickets, passengers 
can choose how important it is to get there on time.

David Kottcamp

the right direction. The airlines have shown that only punitive measures against 
them will yield a positive reponse from a customer perspective. Actrually, given 
inflation, the proposed limits are not punitive at all. They are less than the 
increase should be if said compensation were indexed for inflation. The rates $200/
$400 rates were set in 1978. Using a standard measure of inflation, $200 in 1978 
dollars is on the order of $642 in 2006 dollars. NACA arguements that the 
proposed modest increase are draconion are absurd.

2) European Union rules regarding passenger rights which are currently in effect 
appear to be more stringent than those proposed. The EU rules appears to be well 
thought out and are intended to promote appropriate behavior by airlines in regards 
to the passenger expierence. I would propose that EU regulations regarding 
passenger rights serve as the model for future US regulations.

denied a seat due to overbooking.  In addition, I support requiring the airlines
to pay any other costs incurred by the customer as a result of being denied a
seat on a flight.  For example, someone going on a short 3 or 4 day getaway
vacation who is denied a seat but manages to get a flight the next day has been
greatly inconvenienced.  The customer has had to pay, in advance, a
non-refundable hotel bill that has now been partially unused.  Also, the
customer may have their vacation ruined due to the loss of time spent on
vacation that was short to begin with.

I really would like to support even stricter rules.  I would like to eliminate
the practice of overbooking entirely.  Most airfares cannot be canceled at a
late date, with the expectation of getting any money back (tickets are
non-refundable).  Therefore, the airlines should in general be required to not
sell more seats than they have, they are compensated already should the traveler
cancel.

measure for passengers who have lost travel, prepaid vacations (hotel, rental

gate space lined up, crews and aircraft allocated, and provided all of the 
communities with a start date of September 5th or 6th.

During the community discussion process, the incumbent claimed to be able to 
interline with ""hundreds"" of airlines and offer a seamless connection, which 
according to the manager of the Macon Airport, was the reason they chose 
Pacific Wings over VPJ. (We later found out that number doesn't come close to 
100).

In Athens, the incumbent even went as far as to claim 'if you lose an engine in a 
twin, you will roll over, burn up, and kill everyone on board' (public record on or 
about May 20th at the Airport Advisory Board meeting).  Yet in in the past 2 
months, there have been serveral Caravan-engine outs that have resulted in the 
loss of life.  They also claimed 
excellent service in Hawaii by removing 3 cities off of the EAS books - while true, 
he failed to mention that competitor Mokulele was submitting a competing bid that 
was lower than their current subsidy rates.  The residents in Hana have also sent 
the DOT and Congress numerous letters complaining about the service provided.  I 
do not think that an aviation-enthusiast magazine calling the incumbent ""the best 
airline in hawaii' the merits to claim its on equal footing as receiving the Triple 
Crown (ref: Southwest Airlines). 

The notions of Wings Air are calling out irresponsible bidding that has caused a 
disservice to the community.  The carriers that bid on EAS need to be held 
accountable for their claims and actions otherwise it undermines the due process 
set forth by the DOT.",,,,,,,

Question Nine: MINIMAL PROTECTION: I urge the DOJ to remove the phrase
""minimal protection"" from the new definition of a Service Animal. ""Protection""
means aggression training in the dog industry; this will lead to misinterpretation.
2. Question Ten: OTHER SPECIES: I ask the Department to consider establishing
guidelines that would limit the use of other species only to animals who can be
trained to meet the same standards for behavior and training that assistance
dogs must meet to qualify for public access.
3. Question Eleven: A SIZE OR WEIGHT LIMIT: I oppose a size or weight limitation
on common domestic animals like assistance dogs! It would discriminate against
disabled persons whose weight, height and/or the severity of their mobility
impairment necessitates that they work with a dog of a breed of sufficient size
and strength to prevent falls or perform other tasks without injury to the dog.
4. Problem: The DO WORK phrase in the Definition: I urge the Department to
eliminate the ""do work"" phrase in the proposed Definition and continue to
include the requirement that service animals must be individually trained to
perform ""tasks"" for the benefit of a disabled individual.",,,,,,,

I have two documented disabilities.

I am blind

I have epilepsy

I also have a mobility impairment which is arthritis

Due to these unpredictable/ihibiting conditions that have pernanently affected my 
life I have a service animal. It is domestic. It is not a dog, it is not a 
miniature pony. It is in fact 4 feet tall at the shoulder. I am 4 feet tall at the 
shoulder. It carries me wherever I go and tends to my disabilities exactly as a 
seeing eye /seizure/mobility alert dog do. This equine was individually trained to 
serve my needs.

A dog will not perform all the functions as completely as my current service 
animal. I would not live my life as fully nor independantly. My service pony is all 
i need. I am happy with her and she serves me very well. SHe is and has never 
been a danger to me or others. She is entirely faithful and dutiful.

Therefore I deeply protest/question this new supposed change in law to define an 
exact service animal. I have been lead to believe that equines, ALL 
equines will be removed from the preceeding law. In effect dismissing them as 
suitable service animals. The irrefyutable fact is that they DO service 
perfectly fine. Mine being no exception as for others.

What I propose is that the law simply be adjusted but allow for the disabled to do 
as they have, make their own judgements and decisions freely as they 
have at their discretion. Otherwise you people are the ones violating our rights 
when you dictate what animal may be used. You will in effect limit my 
quality if life in choose for me what I can or cant do, how far and fast I can travel, 
and if I can even travel at my own choosing. 

Buses, taxis, service buses and even my own human support do NOT get me 
where and when I need/want to go at my choosing. My service pony 
accomodates my life in a pronounced manner. She fullfills my life more than they 
all do combioned.

What exactly will this law do with regards to equines and me personally.

If it does as I have been lead to believe, then I WILL fight this until I die.

And if I am given my ""rights"" back, I intend to have my pony formally accepted by 
the state of texas in which I reside. There arent even any schools here! 
And a school for guide dogs would not even be apropriate! Unless they can 
combine the duties of a seeing eye/seizure/mobility dog into ONE assessment 
course upon which to properly test my pony. She serves three of these major 
functions in my life! She doesnt do just one thing.

I'm a thoroughly pissed off and fearful disabled human being who thought I was 
protected and had my freedom.

So much for justice and freedom.

I can not help being a cripple

And I'll damned if some shmuck tells me my pony isnt a service animal due to her 
species. Test her, watch her in action and you'll see she does fine. 
She's BEEN doing fine for 7 whole long years!

When humans are not there, what is left?

Even if they are where is my right to do what I please, how and when?

Thats the whole point of having a service animal FREEDOM.

Shasta","CA","96067","United States",,,,,,,"The new standards for drug testing as described in sec 40.67 b are outlandish. I 
am outraged at this new proceedure of a type of strip search. After 42 years in the 
railroad industry I now have to strip down in front of officers or whoever the RR 
finds acceptable and do my ""business"" in front of them. I have a very big problem 
with this. It is totally unacceptable to me and my co-workers. The problem with 
this type of testing is that if an individual rejects this conduct from the governing 
bodies he or she is labeled as a ""druggy"" and only those who have ""nothing to 
hide"" will resent this type of testing. How about having those in government who 
supervise or judges or even presedents of the US do this same proceedure. I do 
not think it would pass. I believe that where there is a problem with drugs that the 
problem is suspected and due action will occur. 
I find the biggest problem with the Railroad industry is with fatigue. This issue is 
only brushed over and eyes are turned the other way. Another factor is male 
pattern depression because of the hours worked, meals and sleep coming at 
bazzar times causes many stresses at the RR work place for those in Engine or 
Train service. The government bodies that regulate are totally out of touch. Have 
them work the crazy hours and put up with the work condidions and then have 
them submit to rude and embarassing searches of their private parts. I did not like 
Gym in highschool because of the environment in the showers. Being naked in 
front of others is not one of my preferences and I am abhorred at the prospect of 
stripping down in front of others and treated to embarassing searches. If you want 
a ""clean"" environment then treat those in the industry with respect and not with 
abuse! The results of ""dirty"" tests is very low on the rail industry. How about going 
after the truckers or Government workers who can affect so many people. The 
highway patrol can't even keep truckers to the posted speed and now you want to 
go after Railroaders....this is truely bizzar. Mark Telegin",,,,,,,

extremely hard drug is out of a person's system within 24 hours.  I suggest that 
we do late night test for those addicted to alcohol and they have like 30 minutes 
to make it to the testing sight for a breathalyzer.  I suggest that all vehicles that

operator has a substance abuse history.  I would much rather be on the opposite 
side of the highway approaching a vehicle operated by someone who smoked 
marijuana last weekend than a vehicle operated by someone who drank a 6 pack

fatal drug in the world. The Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor

escorted and has no time to cheat the system. Well perhaps where she works, 
but that is hardly the case across the board. I find the system quite loose with 
many empoyers with plenty of time for the employee to implement a devise or 
adulturate the urine. I would support tightening up the system at the employer's 
end as well. I have found the trucking industry especially uneducated about the 
DOT regulations. So, I do support this idea, but do wonder with the current

I am 
presently managing the case of a driver, who for the second time has substituted 
his wife's urine for his own. He had done the same thing at a random test in 
November of 2007.  The second episode was a follow-up test.  

In November as now, The driver was very ""up front"" about his desire to use 
marijuana as a method to unwind at the end of a busy day, like others come home 
and have a drink or two.  He has the usual pseudo-intellectual arguments about 
alcohol versus marijuana and the number of people injured related to alcohol daily, 
and said that he will never be convinced that pot is dangerous.  I suggested that 
he simply get another line of work outside the bounds of DOT rules, so that he can 
live his life unfettered by the testing regulations.  Of course the income would be 
significantly different, and he is not willing to give that up. The employer is aware of 
his substitution, being made aware by me at the initial violation. 

Thought he is complying with the treatment intervention.  No matter how 
compliant, I have no faith in this individuals promise to remain abstinent, that he 
will make at our post-treatment interview.  He made that promise 10 months ago.

My thinking is that any violation related to an attempt to beat a test by adulteration 
or substitution, etc., should result in DOT mandating a long, if not permanent, 
removal from safety sensitive duties, thus relieving all from the discomfort and 
obstacles related observed return to duty and follow-up test.  

Whether those involved in trying to cheat a return to duty or follow-up test are 
addicted, abusers, or naïve should be of no concern to DOT. As one comment 
says, and the case above proves, those who do it once will try to do it again.  
Those individuals should not be allowed to put the public at risk.

I'm in a safety related 
field here in 
california.   I had recently been tested on tuesday september 9 2008.  
Unfortunately, the MRO who administered my test wasn't aware of the new rule 
change being 
pushed back to Nov. 1st.  Therefore, he had told me that he was gonna have to do 
an observe 
collection, which I couldn't perform.   After trying to go several times I finally 
convinced him to 
call 
his lab which was quest Labs, which was when he found the ruling had been 
pushed back.  I find 
the observe collection to be degrading, humiliating, and extremely stressful.  I've 
had over 8 test 
this year which have all been negative, but these weren't observe collection.   I find 
it hard for 
me to go to urinate in any situation when I have people standing behind me or 
close by.  I don't 
mind being padded down to see if I have any device which could alter a test, but I 
can't pee 
when someone is around me.  From this I find myself to be very stressed out at 
work, 
humiliated, and embarrassed, which has affected my job performance. It's the only 
thing on my 
mind, which isn't a good thing being that I'm in a safety related position.  I feel as if 
the Dot 
should come up with another form of testing such as a saliva, blood or hair follicle 
type of test 
for individuals with the problem I have when it comes to urinating in the presence of 
another 
person.  All the rest of my co-workers who are in line behind me will know that I 
have a problem 
urinating in front of someone when they see that I'm not able to produce the 
sample, which is 
another issue I have with it.   It would be very hard for someone with my condition 
to face 
another another co-worker.  Also, feel that the DOT will find out that many more 
people have this 
problem which I have, as far as an observe test if this rule stands since it's an 
embarrasing 
problem, which most keep private.   I hope you consider my thoughts and will 
make it more 
comfortable for a hard working American who shouldn't lose his job due to not 
being able to 
produce a sample.  I've heard of the shy bladder syndrome which I might have so I 
hope the 
DOT will read my comments and consider the pain and the stress which it has 
already caused 
me as far as not being able to produce a sample upon observation.  Lastly, I would 
like to stress 
that I have no problem with a drug test, but just with the new rule change",,,,,,,

The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO
Docket Number OST-2003-15245
Submitted September 25, 2008
Via Federal eRulemaking Portal

The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO, which represents 55,000 
Flight Attendants at 20 airlines, applauds the Department of Transportation’s 
postponement of 40.67(b) to allow for a formal comment period on its proposal to 
make direct observation testing mandatory, rather than discretionary, for return to 
duty and follow up drug testing.  We hope that our comments will be considered 
and that DOT will eliminate this proposed rule change in its entirety. 

Before we share our concerns specifically about 40.67(b), we offer our concerns 
about the August 25, 2008 change to the direct observation (DO) collection 
procedure which requires prosthetic device inspections for authorized and 
mandatory DO test situations.   Given that prosthetic device inspections will be a 
part of return to duty and follow up testing if 40.76 (b) is adopted, our objections 
should be considered. 

We oppose the August 25, 2008 inclusion of a prosthetic device check for all 
direct observation collections described in 40.67 (i).  DOT made this change 
without a formal notice of propose rule making and without a formal public 
comment period.  In the Federal Register Vol. 73 No. 166 page 50225, DOT 
states that the department “explicitly sought comments in its October 2005 
Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) on whether collectors should check to 
make sure that employees providing a specimen under DO are not using a 
prosthetic device to cheat on the test (e.g. by having an employee lower his pants 
and underwear so that the collector or observer could determine whether the 
employee was using such a device)”. This request for comments was in the 
NPRM but it was not in direct response to a notice of proposed change.  

In the October 2005 NPRM, DOT actually asked, “Would it be appropriate to 
require that collectors and observers, as appropriate, check for these devices by 
having male employees lower their pants and underwear just before observed 
collections take place?”  Procedurally and in spirit, this “explicit opportunity” could 
best be characterized as a request for an initial reaction to the use of prosthetic 
device inspections just for men, only as appropriate, and requiring limited frontal 
exposure.  AFA believes that expanding the DO process to include mandatory 
prosthetic device  inspections for all employees with a naked pirouette is such a 
significant departure from DOT’s prior DO collection and from all other regulated 
collections that a formal comment period should have been afforded.  Witholding a 
NPRM and formal comment period for 40.67(i) demonstrates an extreme 
insensitivity towards and devaluation of personal privacy and dignity. 

The rationale that DOT has offered for the implementation of 40.67 (i) is that 
prosthetic checks are necessary to safeguard the integrity of the drug testing 
process.  According to DOT, the increasing availability of prosthetic devices on 
the internet suggests that the integrity of the drug testing process is 
compromised.  However, DOT has offered no evidence to substantiate any 
relationship between the availability and/or number of prosthetic devices on the 
internet and acts of drug test cheating by DOT safety sensitive employees. While 
the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA is a full supporter of ensuring optimal 
safety for our members and the flying public, we believe that alternate measures 
exist for ensuring the integrity of the drug testing process.  Improved collector 
training, enforcement of existing collection safeguards and legislative action which 
bans the sale of substances or devices used to beat drug tests are three such 
measures that are reasonable and achievable without compromising testing 
integrity and the dignity of the person being tested.  

Part of the rationale that DOT has offered for the immediate implementation of 
40.67 (i) is that direct observation occurs in only a very small percentage of DOT 
test situations.  While this is an accurate characterization today, it is a 
misrepresentation of what the future holds should 40.67 (b) be implemented.  If 
DO collections are required for drug tests conducted as a part of the return to duty 
process (which minimally includes 1 return to duty drug test, at least 6 follow up 
tests in year 1 of return to work and an unlimited and unspecified number of follow 
up tests in years 2 through 5) then the number of direct observation tests will be 
significant.   

Under existing DOT requirements, every employee who has a verified positive drug 
test result on any type of test (including pre-employment, random, post accident, 
and reasonable cause/suspicion) whether for alcohol and/or drugs, is subject to 
return to duty and follow up drug testing based on the formula explained above 
regardless whether the DOT violator returns to their existing employer or finds 
another employer.  Alcohol test violators could also be included in the potential 
pool of return to duty and follow up drug tests since Substance Abuse 
Professionals are authorized to require drug testing in the return to duty testing 
plan for alcohol violators. 

Given that the current drug test positive rate for safety sensitive employees is  2% 
and there are approximately 12,000,000 DOT safety sensitive employees, it is 
estimated that up to 240,000  employees could be subject to 40.67 (b) procedures 
each year.  In the first year of return to safety sensitive duty, this potential pool of 
240,000 employees (which does not include alcohol test positives) would 
minimally be required to submit to   1,680,000 DO tests.  Given the potential 
number of drug tests subject to 40.67(b) and 40.67 (i) as well as the potential 
administrative and cost burdens associated with these changes, (including donor 
and observer gender matching and lost productivity), the DO requirement for return 
to duty and follow-up testing is an unreasonable assault on employee privacy and 
business margins.  

An added and unfortunate result of 40.67 (b) may also be employer retrenchment 
from offering employment, reemployment and/or continuing employment to those 
who have completed a rehabilitation/education process.
 
Recently, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) reported that 75% of 
inspected drug testing collection sites failed to secure their facility from 
substances that could be used to adulterate or dilute a drug test specimen.  For 
example, sixty-seven percent (67%) of the sites failed to secure all sources of 
water in the restroom so specimens could not be diluted.   Forty-two percent 
(42%) did not ask employees to empty her/his pockets to ensure that no items 
were present that could be used to adulterate specimens.  Nineteen percent 
(19%) failed to check the temperature of the specimen.  These are simple and 
very basic DOT collection procedures established to safeguard the integrity of the 
testing process against cheating.  Adding a controversial and time consuming 
procedure like DO collections when collectors are already struggling to comply 
with existing safeguards will surely burden an already troubled collection system.  

The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA challenges the need for 40.67 (b) and 
40.67 (i).   As reported in Quest’s 2007 Drug Testing Index, drug use by safety 
sensitive employees is at an historic low.  The positive rate for safety sensitive 
employees is currently measured at 2% which is down from 2.5% in 2002.  Safety 
sensitive employees have a 250% lower drug test positive rate compared to the 
general US workforce.  Over the past five years, reliable data proves that there has 
been no significant change in the rate of tampering with drug tests by safety 
sensitive employees as evidenced by Quest’s non-negative specimen validity test 
results between 2002 and 2006.  In fact, non-negative rates by oxidizing 
adulterants have dropped 500% from .05% in 2002 to 0% in 2006.  The low 
positive and even lower adulteration and substitution rates for safety sensitive 
employees offer evidence that there is no compelling public need for 40.67 (b) and 
40.67(i).  

Of paramount concern to the Association of Flight Attendants –CWA are the 
prejudicial thinking and proposed discriminatory practices underpinning DOT’s 
40.67(b).  According to the Department, substance abusing and/or dependent 
rehabilitated employees, as a group, are at higher risk of tampering with their drug 
test specimens than the rest of the workforce  because they have a heightened 
motivation to cheat on their  return to duty and follow up tests  should they 
experience a relapse which would jeopardize their jobs if detected.   Therefore, 
40.67 (b) proposes that these employees should be subject to direct observation 
testing for all return to duty and all follow up drug tests.   In unraveling this multi-
speculative thinking, the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA offers the below 
objections.    

Employees who test positive have statistically demonstrated a higher propensity 
towards honesty in the drug testing process than one can logically ascribe to the 
general DOT drug testing population. They submitted their dirty urines for testing 
rather than adulterate or substitute it.  

Safeguards are already built into the return to duty process to address relapse.  
Those safeguards include an initial and return to duty substance abuse evaluation 
by a professional, mandatory education and/or treatment, and unannounced and 
accelerated testing for up to five years.  Moreover, there has been no evidence or 
documentation put forth by the DOT demonstrating that the DOT return to duty 
process needs fixing or enhancing.   

Rehabilitated employees who are returned to work after a test positive must 
remain clean as a part of their continuing employment.  Conditional employment 
actually serves as a protective factor not as a relapse factor. Recovery rates are 
significantly higher for employer monitored rehabilitated employees than the 
general population.  

While employers have been authorized to conduct DO collections  for  return to 
duty and follow up tests, their petitions to postpone the implementation of 40.67 
(b) and 40.67 (i) suggests that they rarely, if ever, utilized this invasive 
procedure.   

All other DOT mandated DO collections are based on evidence (either a lab test 
result or an observed behavior) that one donor during one collection may have 
cheated on one drug test.  Additionally, this donor is not automatically subject to 
DO testing on future tests.  However, in 40.67 (b) the DOT proposes that all 
individuals who belong to the group of successfully rehabilitated employees must 
be subject to DO testing on all occasions because of fears rather than evidence.  

AFA-CWA vigorously opposes direct observation testing and any enhancement to 
and/ or expansion of that process as proposed in 40.67 (b) and implemented in 
40.67 (i).    DOT has not provided any measurable evidence to support the notion 
that cheating is on the rise or that cheating cannot be contained by existing 
collection safeguards when followed.  The mere availability of internet devices 
does not justify the erosion of personal privacy for millions of DOT safety sensitive 
employees.   

Using items displayed on the internet as a rationale for significant procedural 
changes and ignoring empirical data from established and certified laboratories is 
a troubling precedent. 

Requiring rehabilitated employees to submit to DO testing for all return to duty 
and follow up tests is a discriminatory policy which mandates unreasonable 
searches.
  
We request that you rescind 40.67 (b) and 40.67 (i).  We ask that you identify non-
invasive measures to protect the integrity of the testing process, like improved 
collector training, enforcement of existing safeguards and legislative initiatives to 
ban drug test tampering devices. This is the best path to ensuring the integrity of 
our drug testing process and ensuring the safety of our transportation system.  
This also is the path recommended by the GAO in its recent report on collection 
safeguards.

That the new policy focuses on already identified offenders, and not to anyone

The new policy seems to be highly intrusive and potentially embarrassing. What,

During this time, attempts to ""beat"" the drug test have increased significantly.  
Drug abusers will go to any length to continue using, therefore those who have 
tested positive in the past, and who continue to abuse drugs, are motivated by 
their addiction to adulterate, substitute, or use prosthetic-type devices to provide 
a ""clean"" specimen at the collection site.  Direct observation drug collections that 
took place prior to 8/25/08 did not effectively deter such individuals because real-
looking prosthetic devices could successfully be used without detection by the 
observer.  Therefore I believe DOT has taken appropriate and justifiable actions to 
combat the problem.  

Revised direct observation collection procedures create increased responsibilities 
for the direct observer.  Observed collections have always been awkward, and will 
continue to be so.  Collectors, and individuals they designate as observers, should 
be given crystal clear guidance on how to conduct these collections.  DOT has 
made a good effort at providing guidance for collectors and observers.  Our 
company, Alpha Pro Solutions, a national drug and alcohol test training 
organization, has taken additional steps including providing a suggested 
verbatim ""script"" to our clients with recommended communication and observation 
techniques in line with DOT requirements.  Unfortunately, I believe some collection 
sites will gloss over the revised DOT observation regulations, and will not 
implement proper ""update"" training of collectors.  Therefore, I believe ""update"" 
training should be mandatory, with a specific training agenda provided by DOT, 
and a mock proficiency requirement as part of the required update training.  I 
believe collector role-play scenarios will greatly increase the level of 
professionalism and accuracy that should be exhibited by each trained collector 
and/or their designated observer.  I do not believe we should assume that 
collectors who have been ""told"" about the revised procedures have a practical 
understanding of how and when observed collections should be properly 
conducted. 

Regarding mandatory Return-to-Duty and Follow-Up testing observed collections, I 
believe this requirement is prudent and appropriate given the individuals' former 
attempts to ""beat"" the DOT drug-free rules by either refusing to test, or by 
providing a positive, adulterated, or substituted specimen.  Mandatory direct 
observation collections for RTD and FUP testing is truly a deterrant, and in line 
with the intent of the Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Program.  

Lastly, I believe DOT should strongly consider making additional drugs of abuse 
(namely drugs available by prescription but abused) part of the mandatory 
substance abuse testing panel.  

Respectfully and in support of DOT drug test revised regulations, 
Sue Clark

someone who is reqired to, and does get tested under the  FMCSA  rules for 
drugs and alcohol, I would like to submit my objection to the new direct 
observation testing rule;  DOT-OST-2003-15245-0139.

I feel that this new rule is a violation of my personal rights.

If for any reason the tester or employer feels that the person being tested needs to 
be retested, even if there is no grounds for it except to cause an extreme 
inconvenience to the person being tested, knowing that under the new rules the 
person must then be directly observed. This means they must raise or lower there 
clothing and expose themself to the tester. Further more if the person being 
tested refuses to be observed, under the new rules the person is then 
disqualified.  That means UNEMPLOYED.

Why can't less invasive more acurate retesting be done?   If the employee or 
person being tested attests that the negative results are false or incorrect. Or that 
the presumtion of falsification, or use of adulterants, are also not correct, why then 
can't the person then have their blood drawn? 

By having their blood drawn you would get much more acurate extremely less 
invasive positive or negative results.  This could be done with the understanding 
that if the person being retested still tested positive, the cost of the retest would 
be at the expense of the that person being retested.  If a negative test result or 
confirmation that the employee or person being tested is infact drug free the cost 
would then go to the agency that felt a retest needed to be done.

with other disabilities is just as discriminatory as treating people with
disabilities differently than those without disabilities.

Permitting emotional support animals in aircraft is problematic because the
animals are not necessarily temperamentally suited to be in that type of
stressful situation, or trained to behave properly including toileting and how
they interact with other passengers.  However, in order to permit emotional
support animals on aircraft, the DOT established a policy of asking for
documentation for the animal, not of temperament or training (for the purposes
of protecting the public safety) but of proof of disability (for the purposes of
discouraging pet owners).

Many pet owners have already figured out it is easy to ask their family doctor
for a note so they can take their show dog or pet in the cabin with them. 
Requiring additional documentation of another type of animal, a psychiatric
service animal, will not decrease the number of pets in the cabin for this reason.

Many others have discovered they can get their pets ""certified"" as a service
animal by merely claiming that it is one and paying a $40-$50 fee over the
internet, to organizations such as SARA.  

The DOT also established the opportunity for airline employees to ask the owner
of an animal for credible assurances the animal is indeed a service animal. 
That can include asking precisely what the dog is trained to do.  This is an
accepted method for determining whether a given dog is a service dog in other
public accommodations covered by the ACAA's sister law, the ADA.

If the DOT wants to seriously curtail false claims of pets as service dogs, they
should 1) notify airlines they may ignore documentation from known ""diploma
mills"" such as SARA and base their determinations solely on credible verbal
assurances rather than ""certification"" and 2) create penalties for pet owners
shown to have made a false claim that a pet is a service animal.

People with psychiatric disabilities are already singled out in our society
because of the nature of their disease.  Many consider them mentally weak or
simply lazy.  Others consider them down-right dangerous.  Solely because of
their disability.  It is the very worst kind of discrimination because it is so
socially accepted that most do not recognize it as discrimination.

People with mental disabilities should not be singled out for special
examination and the humiliation of being treated inferior to others with other
disabilities.  Of all disabilities, those with psychiatric disabilities are most
negatively impacted by being put under undue emotional stress.  They would be
forced into the very situations they find difficult to manage because of their
disability.

Presumably this discrimination would further be perpetrated by employees making
value judgments on whether a given dog might be a service dog based on its breed
or size.  Therefore, those with disabilities other than mental illness who
coincidentally use service dogs of unusual breeds or sizes, will also be
subjected to additional inspection.

What, then, will be the consequence if a person with, say, a Papillion service
dog is asked for a letter from their doctor because the employee thinks that a
Papillion couldn't possibly be a real service dog?  What happens if the person
explains the dog is a hearing dog or seizure alert dog?  Will the employee then
be allowed to refuse boarding based on their own opinion as to whether small
dogs might do service work?  What would stop someone with a psychiatric service
dog, or emotional support animal or pet for that matter, from lying about the
nature of the work their dog does?

The clearest evidence of whether a dog is truly a service dog is his
professionalism and demeanor and the credible verbal assurances of his handler,
without regard the questioner's personal biases about service dogs.",,,,,,,

Gulfstream to provide subsidized essential air service to Parkersburg and the Mid-
Ohio Valley.  Gulfsteam’s bid, with more frequent service, is the key to allowing 
the airport to emerge from the EAS program in the next two years.  

Since taking over the service in Parkersburg, Colgan has been unresponsive to the 
community.  Repeated emails and phone calls go unanswered, airfares make no 
sense, and on occasion, the interiors of the aircraft have been less than clean.  
During the bidding process, Colgan made no attempt to work with the community 
to craft a creative alternative to two flights per day.  

The text in Gulfstream’s bid indicated that they have researched the history of the 
area and the air service before submitting the bid.  I believe that they share the 
goal of the citizens of emerging from EAS and supporting profitable air service.  
That goal will not be realized with two flights per day to any city.  

I believe that we can count on local and state politicians as well as airport officials 
and possibly a U.S. Senator to support Colgan’s bid.  Their short-sided goal is to 
keep the larger (albeit empty) aircraft flying into Parkersburg.  

If Gulfstream is selected, hopefully they will work directly with the frequent flyers 
in the local communities to craft air service that meets the community’s needs 
and is operationally efficient and eventually profitable for them.  Thank you for your 
time and consideration.

Office of the Secretary
Proposed revisions to 49 CFR parts 18 and 19
DOT-OST-2007-0021
RIN 2105-AD60

The proposes revisions make minor referencing revisions to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) cost principle circulars and make significant 
revisions to prohibit the payment of profit or fee to grantees and subgrantee 
covered by 49 CFR part 19.  

I support the prohibition on profit.

The revised referencing is needed as the OMB cost circulars have been published 
in Title II of the Code of Federal Regulations since August 2005.  However, these 
OMB circulars are only published as guidance (see 2 CFR 1.105(a)).  Also, the 
OMB circular number has been retained in the title of each circular, for example, 2 
CFR part 225, “Cost Principles for State and Local Governments (OMB Circular A-
87).”

As you can see in the titles, the circular numbers have still been retained by 
OMB.  I have no problem with using the new CFR references, but I believe that the 
title for the CFR part, which includes the OMB Circular number in the title, should 
be included in the reference for all three cost principles.  In addition, this would 
make the formatting of all titles in 49 CFR sections 18.22 and 18.27 consistent.  
For well over 30 years, Federal and grantee officials have been using the OMB 
circular number for cost principles.  To just list CFR part numbers without their 
titles could cause unnecessary confusion.  Listing just the CFR part would leave 
the impression that these cost principles are regulations which is clearly not the 
case a noted in the previous paragraph.

Finally, I see no reason for the two regulations to be different.  Therefore, I 
recommend that the cost principles for hospitals be added to 49 CFR 18.22.  The 
only reason to leave that cost principle out would be if state or local governments 
do not award any grants or contracts to hospitals.

The comments below are based on my 30 years of experience in Federal grants 
management and 5 years of training Federal and grantee officials.

requirements for trains.  However, the proposed regulations seem to have been
written by someone who has never been on a long train trip.  They should be
amended to reflect a better understanding of intercity trains.  In intercity
trains, level access to all cars is desirable and appropriate; but level
boarding of all cars is totally unnecessary for this, and costs a lot extra.

In an intercity train, the train cars are generally designed so that passengers
can walk -- *or wheel their wheelchairs* -- between cars.  This is in fact
crucial to accessibility, as passengers will want to travel to the lounge car,
or the cafe car or dining car.  The trips are long, so there is plenty of time
to travel to your seat or compartment from whatever car you enter in.  There is
no need to be able to level-board at all cars; if you can level-board at one,
designated point on the platform, and then walk level between cars, then you
have full level access to the entire train.

Where the cars on the train do *not* provide level travel between cars, and do
not need to provide such travel -- as with some bilevel commuter cars, where
there is no intercar travel and no cafe cars -- then it makes some sense to
require level boarding for all cars.  But where the trains *do* provide level
travel between cars -- which is more common -- and where the trips are of the
longer commuter and intercity lengths, it makes no sense at all.  

Amtrak currently has two classes of intercity trains.  The Superliners are
bilevel cars; passengers can travel level between cars at the upper level only,
and can board at the lower level only, at low platforms (15 inches above top of
rail).  The two levels are interconnected by stairs.  This is clearly not an
ADA-accessible design because it does not allow passengers to get from their
seats to the dining car.  It should be largely ignored for purposes of platform
design, as future trains should not be designed this way, and will not be
designed this way.  

As a side note, future ADA-accessible design requirements for intercity trains
should make level travel from one's seat to all amenities, like the dining and
lounge cars, a requirement; this is fairly straightforward to include in a
brand-new design (perhaps by including an ""elevator car"").

The second class of trains used by Amtrak are the single-level trains used on
the Northeast Corridor, the route from Chicago to Albany, and several other
routes with lower clearances.  These can be level-boarded from high platforms
(48 inches above top of rail) -- but they have full level travel between all
cars at all times.

Intercity trains are very long.  The proposed rule could require stations to
have 12-car or 15-car-long high platforms, which are very expensive compared to
low platforms with a short high-platform section.  And it would be utterly
pointless, because a station with a short 1-car-long high-platform, which is
much cheaper, would serve the same purpose: wheelchair access to all cars.  In
fact, historically intercity stations often have had platforms much shorter than
the trains which serve them, and board only through certain cars; passengers
then comfortably walk through the train to get to the other cars.  The proposed
rule would be akin to requiring an elevator for every staircase into a subway
station, rather than simply requiring elevator access to the station.

In addition, there are many stations which may need to be served both by trains
which level-board at high platforms, and trains which level-board at low
platforms.  This includes every station from Chicago through Cleveland
(currently served by both types of Amtrak trains).  What sort of platforms
should they have?  The most logical thing to do would be to provide full-length
level-boarding for low-level trains (which are less likely to have level passage
between cars), and one-or-two-car level boarding for high-level trains (which
will almost certainly have level passage between cars).  The proposed rule would
actually make it harder to make this sensible choice.

In summary, the proposed rule suffers from confusion between level *boarding*
and level *access*.
*Where a train allows for level travel between cars*, and the train trip is
*long enough* that the extra travel between cars is not a serious inconvenience,
then level boarding is only necessary at *one designated point on the platform*
in order to achieve the *actual goal*, which is *level access* to all cars.

Please amend the rule to take account of this crucial issue.

Thank you for your time and attention.",,,,,,,

to add one.  On a recent trip, it became obvious that airlines need to commit to 
training their gate agents and other airport-based staff members better in matters 
of customer service during extensive delays or flight cancellations.  

In December 2007, I was on a flight from Detroit that couldn't land at its intended 
destination (Minneapolis) due to poor visibility conditions.  After circling Eau Claire 
for an hour, we were redirected for re-fueling out in Fargo (ND).  Once we had 
landed, the Fargo ground crew took well over 3 hours to refuel us, and as a result, 
our flight crew's duty time expired.  Our flight was cancelled, and some 125 
people were left at this rather tiny airport on a Sunday evening with only a few 
Northwest staff in evidence.  

I should insert here that our flight crew took very good care of us while we waited, 
and did everything in their power to keep things moving.  However, the Northwest 
Airlines staff at the airport did a terrible job of handling the situation.  Consistent 
communication of information (ranging from whether hotels would be provided, how 
to contact hotels in the area, what time everyone had to be back for the flight in 
the morning, etc.) was completely non-existent.  Instead the only way anyone got 
answers was by information of varying accuracy trickling through the crowd.  

Additionally, while we were on the airplane, we were told we would be put up at 
hotels.  Once off the plane, we were told the exact opposite.  This left many 
people in a very uncomfortable predicament, since not everyone could shell out 
$100 or more for a hotel room that night.  There were elderly people, handicapped 
people, single mothers with small children, single women traveling alone, none of 
whom could be imaginably made comfortable to spend the night in a terminal with 
no amenities.

This entire situation would have been dramatically improved had any one of the 
Norwest staff at the airport had enough training and leadership skills to deal 
properly with the situation.  Dealing with large numbers of passengers is not the 
exclusive territory of large metropolitan airports, and ALL airline staff should know 
how to handle customer service whether with one person or over a hundred.

Thank you for your consideration.

An aircraft is a vehicle for transporting passengers from one place/city to another. 
An aircraft should not be viewed as an extension of airport waiting areas. In the 
event a flight is delayed, passengers should have the right to leave the aircraft up 
to 10 minutes before takeoff. Passengers should not be kept on board an aircraft 
which does not provide adequate ventilation, water, and working restrooms. Food 
service should be provided according to the original schedule, as if the aircraft had 
departed on time.  Airline and airport officials may retain the right to limit 
passengers to secured areas only, except for a passenger's urgent needs. 
For many passengers, retention on a crowded aircraft with concerns about 
departure/arrival times, connecting flights, lost baggage, missed appointments, or 
urgent personal and family matters causes significant distress. Airline and airport 
officials are taking an unnecessary risk when detaining passengers in what 
constitutes a ""holding cell."" This issue is a serious one and should be considered 
with passenger welfare the most important element. To continue present policy is 
to offend the paying passenger. Many will find a more reliable and more 
comfortable means of transportation. Airline officials, beware: the decisions made 
today may lead to an even greater decline in the air transportation industry.

time is the development of Deep Vein Thromboses.  According to the National 
Institute for Health Website, ""The risk increases if the travel time is longer than 4 
hours, or if you have other risk factors for DVT.

During long trips, it may help to:

Walk up and down the aisles of the bus, train, or airplane. If traveling by car, stop 
about every hour and walk around. Move your legs and flex and stretch your feet to 
encourage blood flow in your calves. Wear loose and comfortable clothing. 
Drink plenty of fluids and avoid alcohol.""1

For this important health reason, which can affect all travelers, the proposed 
regulation must not permit delays or confinement for any time greater than four 
hours, must ensure that during any delay passengers are permitted to move freely 
about the cabin, and must be provided with adequate non-alcoholic fluids at no 
cost to the passengers.  Failure to provide passengers with this could lead to 
DVT.  

Consequences of DVT can include pulmonary embolisms, damage to the lungs 
other organs or death. 2

airline sites that leaves consumers with incomplete information.  When a flight
is ""operated by"" another carrier (such as a regional carrier), I often see no
information on that flight, but only the carrier's so-called ""mainline"" flights
it directly operates.  My preferred carrier, USAirways, currently operates their
site in this manner, where I can only see one flight's statistics listed, but
not the second leg of my flight on their regional carrier.   Therefore, I
propose that rulemaking require a carrier to list performance statistics for ALL
flights it tickets through its site, whether it be by code-share, sub-contracted
carrier, etc.

I also propose that 3 hours is unacceptably short period for a carrier to allow
passengers to be essentially hostage. Airlines also must be held accountable to
a standard of being a business. Every plane delayed contains passengers, often
on business, where the delay of that passenger's business has a direct or
indirect impact on that passenger's livelihood, often manyfold beyond the cost
of the airfare.  Even if the proposed maximum is shortened, the regulations
should be written that provide the passenger with rights to:

1. Beverages (non-alcoholic) shall be provided for free, even if the airline
customarily charges for them. At least 1 serving, per hour of the delay.

Reasoning: Passengers with certain health conditions require hydration at least
once per hour.

2. Use of any and all accceptable electronic devices during a substantial delay,
including mobile telephony, until the aircraft is the #5 aircraft in taxi line
for takeoff, or less than 15 minutes to takeoff, as ascertained by the captain.  

Reasoning:
This is particularly important for passengers who could possibly call into a
meeting, and not miss it completely because of airline electronic sterile-cabin
rules being enforced unnecessarily.  Passengers might also wish to modify other
travel plans, as a result of the delay, and would wish to accomplish this while
onboard the delayed plane, rather than waiting until arrival at destination. 
Current cabin rules on electronics are unacceptable during delays, and current
policy of crew discretion should not be a passenger's only option.

3. Reasonable Reaccommodation to destination: If the aircraft is delayed at the
gate, and has been delayed in pushback from gate or gate areas more than 30
minutes by any mechanical delays, customers should be allowed to request
accommodation to board another flight(s) on the same airline, departing from the
same airport, at their choosing, with no financial penalty or fee, so long as
the non-delayed flight has seating capacity. The regulation should require this
option be made available, so long as the alternate flight(s) are scheduled to
depart more than 1 hour after the delayed flight's original departure time.  If
necessary, passengers should also be allowed to opt for connecting flight(s) to
their original destination, at no financial penalty or fee, even if their
original and delayed flight was a non-stop flight.

Reasoning:   This is just common sense. If another flight gets the passenger to
their destination in a more certain or opportunistic way or schedule for the
passenger, it should be their right and choice.

4. Airlines shall be prohibited from boarding the aircraft when a known ""no-fly""
maintenance issue is in progress, until a reasonable time for resolution can be
guaranteed that does not delay the flight by more than 30 minutes. Passengers
should be notified of the maintenance, and offered to be re-accommodated with
alternate reservations at no additional costs, if the passenger so chooses, and
seats are available.  

Reason: Countless travelers such as myself would take another flight option, if
the delayed flight could be avoided before I was on-board.  It is unacceptable
for an airline to board and delay passengers, when the condition existed on last
flight of the aircraft, and it is known before boarding has even begun.  To
force customers to board is an unacceptable practice, regardless of the
airline's ground-crew availability, scheduling, or other labor / profitability
concerns that may be mentioned by airline comments. Passengers often have 
other
flight options, and would choose to use them, if airlines were more honest and
transparent about delay potential. Business travelers on refundable fares, would
want to exercise this option, for example, just to change over to another flight
without the problems.

I'm disappointed by the lack of enforcable language in this document. Nothing in
the recent history of the airline industry suggests that airlines will
voluntarily act to reduce ground delays.

Rather, commercial pressures will continue to force them to keep planes away
from the gates as long as possible, in the hopes they will soon be in the air.

Be setting strong, enforcable rules you can create shared market conditions that
will force airlines and airports to work together to develop commercially viable
solutions that work for airlines and passengers.

First the airlines knowingly schedule more flights than the rated capacity of
airports, which not surprisingly, creates congestion and thus ground delays. 
The reduction in personnel below the minimum to provide the right level of
service is another.

In short, let's not allow the airlines to pull-the-wool-over-our-eyes with
tired, old ""sound bites"".

Root cause analysis is a mature, tried and true methodology that can get at the

Docket # OST 2007 268299
ADA Passenger Vessels

St. George's School operates Geronimo, a Sailing School Vessel (Subchapter R) 
in
the waters between New England and the Caribbean. We typically sail with a total
complement of ten persons onboard. Our school has demonstrated a strong 
support
for the ADA in it’s recent history, but concede that there are circumstances
that preclude some of our students from sailing aboard Geronimo. We make this
decision based on the safety and well-being of all persons on board and the
compatibility of our program with an individual’s particular circumstance. 

In response to sections 39.25, our vessel is quite small, with little room on
deck, and can only accommodate 13 total persons on board at any time. Being
required to accommodate disabled persons on board would prove, not just
challenging, but sometimes impossible in the interest of safety. Although our
vessel was designed in close cooperation with the USCG to comply with current
regulations and safety considerations, we simply are not able to accommodate all
disabled individuals. 

In light of the fact that a significant part of our program involves individuals
on our vessel embarking and debarking via a small inflatable boat, it would
significantly alter the nature of our program, in terms of program content and
operating area. We support the clause proposed in section 39.21(b), that makes
exceptions for vessels that would “fundamentally alter” their operation in
complying with said regulations.

I believe that the proposed regulations are not compatible with a vessel of our
size and purpose, and are clearly not compatible with the sustainability of our
program.

River in the Tunica, MS area. We offer sightseeing and dinner cruises 9 months a 
year. We have 7 full employees and approximately 35 part time employees. We do 
experience a high turnover rate due to the seasonality of our business. Our average 
passenger load per trip is less than 50. As you can tell by this overview, we are a very 
small family owned business and 

ADA TRAINING: Very few of my employees have formal education with regards to 
maritime training. The bulk of employees are service staff that work other jobs as 
bartenders and waiters. Because of this and the previously mentioned high turnover 
rate, it will quite difficult to conduct formal ADA training and be able to maintain ADA 
trained staff. To require formal ADA training for employees that interact with our 
passengers will create a tremendous burden on our operation and will be ineffective 
because of the high turnover rate.

TTY REQUIREMENT: At this time we do not know if TTY services are available to our 
rural area. We urge to determine the availability and cost of this service before making 
it a requirement. We do not use internet sites to sell tickets to passengers. 

 
LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF DISABLED PASSENGERS: In reviewing the proposed 
rule it appears that it was based on larger passenger vessels like cruise ships. Rather 
than using a specific number as a limiting factor we suggest that a sliding scale based 
the vessel capacity be reviewed.
 
MANDATORY COMPANY ADA COMPLAINT RESOLUTION OFFICIALS and VESSEL 
ADA COMPLAINT RESOLUTION OFFICIALS: This proposal appears to have come 
straight from the commercial airline industry and while it might be appropriate for and 
operation like Carnival Cruise Lines, it is totally inappropriate for our small company. 
We cannot afford this additional cost burden. As a small family owned business, any 
complaint regarding any issue is handled my wife or me. We are capable of dealing 
with ADA complaints as well. On board our vessel, our Captain has the necessary 
experience to deal with any possible problems, as he has done throughout his career. 

Propriety of Crew Assistance in Boarding/Deboarding: Our crew is quite competent in 
assisting passengers with boarding and deboarding when needed and they have the 
necessary training for dealing the nuances of our vessel. They must be allowed to 
continue to perform these functions for the safe operation of our vessel. 
 

In closing, please?.please review the practical aspects of these proposed rules before 
implementing them. This is not a case of one size fits all.

regional authority tasked with implementing new public commuter ferry service 
within the San Francisco Bay Area as well as serving as a conduit for the region 
during disasters or emergencies.  WETA is concerned about the detail imposed 
on passenger vessels as it appears that the language is intended for large cruise 
ships as opposed to our small 149 passenger-only vessels.  
1.  Should vessel personnel be required to have training in ADA and accessibility 
matters?  Although not currently in the proposed rule, it is understood that DOT is 
considering same.  A formal ADA training course with certification is not 
customary within the small passenger-only industry.  A company developed 
customer service training which includes ADA is the norm.
2.  TYY and other information Services:  DOT asks whether the rule should be 
amended to incorporate accessibillity standards for vessel company web pages.  
WETA urges DOT not to address this question in the passenger vessel 
rulemaking; but, addess same in a future rulemaking applicable to web sites of all 
types of businesses, not just the passenger vessel industry.
3.  Possible limitations on number of disabled Passengers/advance notice 
requirements:  The DOT proosed rule does allow a 72-hour ""advance notice"" 
requirement for a group of 10 or more passengers with disabilities.  DOT was 
considering large curise ships with hundreds or even thousands of passengers 
when this 10-person group exception was developed.  This could be challenging for 
our small 149 passenger vessels.  Suggest DOT impose a ""sliding scale"" for the 
size of a group for vessels with relatively lower passenger capacities.
4.  Should company ADA complaint resolution officials and vessel ADA complaint 
resolution officials be mandatory?  This proposal is based on the exsiting 
commercial airline model.  WETA won't have the typical resources, number of 
employees, or management structure equivalent to the typical billion dollar airline 
industry.  WETA will employ a feasible and reasonable program to deal with 
customer complaints of all kinds with ADA being one of many.
5.  Propriety of crew assistance in boarding/deboarding.  DOT has expressed an 
interest in this question and has indicated that it anticipates that crew assistance 
will be both appropriate and necessary in certain instances (although it should not 
be veiwed as the customary method of boarding individuals with disabilities.)
WETA strongly states that the rule must allow for crew assistance where 
appropriate.  This is a safety issue.  Safety is paramount as slips, trips, and falls 
are among the most common causes of injuries for all passengers whether 
possessing a disability or not.  Many technically non-disabled passengers request 
crew assistance in boarding and disembarking; consequently, this is not a matter 
of discrimination againsts those with disabilities.  Safety of crew members is also 
a factor and there can be some situations where crew assistance is neither 
possible nor safe, e.g., attempting to lift passengers in heavy motorized chairs or 
scooters.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments to the proposed rulemaking.

BPJ, a company founded in 1883, offers ferry service across Long Island Sound 
between Bridgeport Connecticut and Port Jefferson NY. The service operates on a 
year round basis and utilizes three passenger/vehicle ferries with passenger 
capacities of 1000 persons each. Two of the vessels can carry up to 120 vehicles 
and the third up to 90 vehicles. Utilization in 2007 was approximately one million 
passengers and approximately four hundred sixty thousand vehicles.
BPJ is a small business as defined by the Small Business Administration with 
peak season employment in the 175-200 range with winter employment 
substantially lower.
Regarding the question as to whether vessel personnel should receive special 
training on matters pertaining to ADA and accessibility, our company has the 
expectation of our personnel that they endeavor to assist ALL passengers 
regardless of ability or disability as a need presents. Such expectations should 
cover the intent of the goals of any special training. This, we believe, is consistent 
with the requirements of safety aboard ship, good customer service and maritime 
tradition. It is unfortunate that the strong possibility exists that offers of assistance 
could be misinterpreted as somehow a ?violation? of a regulation. That said, should 
the DOT, or any other agency, develop a short, easily assimilated pamphlet or 
guideline on ADA and accessibility, such material would be welcome indeed.
With respect to text telephones (TTY) doesn?t a combination of website 
availability, telephone option and printed material cover the intent of information 
and reservation accommodation? Further, we believe that the DOT should hold in 
abeyance a decision on web accessibility as this is an issue that pertains to 
businesses of every kind, not just to passenger vessel operators.
With respect to the establishment of company ADA complaint officials and the 
same aboard vessels, we believe that complaints of this nature should be handled 
in the same way that all complaints are handled. In our company, complaints of 
any nature are investigated with the goal of resolution. This is consistent with 
sound business practice and good customer service. Additionally, it is our belief 
that resolving issues, including accessibility issues, can contribute to greater 
utilization of our service and revenue enhancements.
With respect to the propriety of assistance in boarding or disembarking, we again 
refer to the maritime tradition of helping all customers, both able and disabled 
where required and with regard for safety. Marine operators frequently assist 
passengers, again able and disabled, in moving on, off or about a vessel. One can 
envision a scenario where a crew member might hesitate to assist someone 
based on fear of violating a regulation. This would serve neither letter nor the intent 
of accessibility regulations.

Passenger Vessel Operational Requirements under the ADA Act

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Lake Michigan Carferry is a small business and a member of the Passenger 
Vessel Association.  The following comments are in response to your efforts to 
impose operational requirements to all passenger vessels for the DOT ADA rule.  
Lake Michigan Carferry operates the S.S. Badger. The Badger was built in 1952-
53 by the Christy Corporation in Sturgeon Bay, WI and put into service in March of 
1953. Since 1992, the Badger has been in service transporting leisure travelers, 
their vehicles and commercial trucks between Ludington, MI and Manitowoc, WI   
Lake Michigan Carferry is a team of dedicated people committed to expanding our 
100-year car ferry heritage by providing a unique travel experience enhanced by 
superior customer service.  The Badger is a Registered State Historic Site in both 
Michigan and Wisconsin.  The coal fired steam engine propulsion system is 
designated a Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the National Society of 
Mechanical Engineers.   The Badger is a continuation of a vital maritime tradition, 
and we celebrate that heritage by offering a rare opportunity for our passengers to 
enjoy a little history - and a lot of fun.
Our sailing season is from mid-May to mid-October.  At the peak of our season, 
we employ up to 230 employees, half of which hold positions on shore in 
Ludington and Wisconsin.  Aside from approximately 25 employees that work 
through the winter in the corporate office or winter work aboard the Badger, the 
rest of our employees are summer workers.  Our sailing season fits so well with 
college and high school schedules, a large majority of our employees are 
students between the ages of 18 and 22.      
The Badger transports approximately 100,000 passengers, 30,000 autos and 1200 
commercial trucks per season.  The route from Ludington, MI to Manitowoc, WI is 
60 miles, approximately four hours en route.  We have 50-60 crewmembers 
aboard for each trip.
Potential requirement for training in ADA and accessibility.   The crew of the 
Badger consists of both licensed and rated personnel, pursuant to the 
requirements of the Coast Guard.  Outside of our Navigation and Engine 
crewmembers, all other employees do not attend formal courses for maritime 
training.  The students that are hired for the summer season have the most 
interaction with our passengers.    We conduct mandatory safety training 
sessions each season for all crewmembers.  CPR training is required for all 
crewmembers in a supervisory position.  Customer Service training is required for 
all new hires.   A formal ?ADA training course? with certification is not in keeping 
with our current schedule of training sessions.  As a large majority of our 
employees are students, the longevity of their employment is, at the most, one or 
two seasons.  Due to scheduling restraints and the small window of opportunity of 
time that we have with our employees, additional training would create a hardship 
for our company and extra burden to the preparation of our season.   
TTY and other Information Services  The reservation system that we have does not 
currently provide this service.  When a reservationist receives a call from a hearing 
impaired customer, the customer will make the call using operator assistance.  
This allows the hearing impaired person to use a TTY phone on their end.  This 
has proven to be a successful way of communicating with the hearing impaired 
customer and has never been a deterrent or a point of concern.
Historic Vessels  The S.S. Badger and her sister ship the S.S. Spartan were the 
last ? and largest ? coal fired, steam engine carferries built in the U.S.  The 
Badger being the only one of the two that is operational offers an authentic 
historical experience to our passengers.  The engines are two Skinner Unaflow 4-
cylinder steam, rated 3,500 hp at 125 rpm.  The boilers are four Foster-Wheeler ?D-
type?, burning domestic bituminous coal.  The services and activities that are 
offered on each voyage are unique to the history of the Badger and have grown to 
be expected by each and every passenger.  The proposed modifications would 
be ?unduly burdensome? and would ?require a fundamental alteration? to the nature 
of the services and activities that we provide. 
Should Company ADA Complaint Resolution Officials and Vessel ADA Complaint 
Resolution Officials be mandatory?    With every trip across the lake, our 
passengers are handed a ?customer comment card? and encouraged to comment 
on the services they received and suggestions they may have.   We value what 
our passengers have to say and take stock in their suggestions.  Complaints are 
handled in a timely manner by the Cruise Director that is on duty during that 
voyage.  We believe that the personal attention our passengers receive from the 
LMC staff is one of the many unique aspects of sailing on the Badger.  Any 
questions or concerns regarding ADA issues would be handled by the personnel 
with the most knowledge on the subject.  To date we have had very few, if any, 
ADA complaints.
 Propriety of Crew Assistance in Boarding/Deboarding  Our crewmembers are not 
only expected to assist passengers when necessary, but they are encouraged to 
assess every situation for the possibility of slips, trips and falls whether the 
passenger is disabled or not.   We provide a chair-lift for passengers that are 
wheel-chair bound and we offer the chair-lift to any passenger who feels they are 
unable to use the stairs to board the Badger.
Thank you for this opportunity to participate and voice our opinions in this 
rulemaking process.
Respectfully,
Bob Manglitz			Don Clingan
President/CEO			V.P. Marketing

US flagged small passenger vessels that 
carry 62 overnight passengers and 24 crewmembers.  The National Geographic 
Sea Bird was constructed in 1981 and the National Geographic Sea Lion in 1982.  
The vessels are inspected by the US Coast Guard under Subchapter K of Title 46 
CFR.  The vessels operate year round in Southeast Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, 
the Columbia and Snake Rivers and Baja California.  Trips are generally 7 day 
long ?expedition style? voyages in remote areas of the regions we travel focusing 
on Natural History.  Shore landings are done via 19? Zodiac inflatable boats for the 
purpose of offering guided hikes.  Passengers are also offered opportunities for 
kayaking in one and two person sea kayaks.  Snorkeling is offered in Baja 
California.

Given the nature of our operation (i.e. landing people in remote locations on shores 
where no facility exists and taking them on hikes through rugged terrain) we are 
particularly concerned about Section 39.21(b).  We specifically support the 
retention of the ?fundamentally alter/undue burden? clause in the proposed section.

The Master of the Vessel deals with any complaints on board made by our 
guests.  They attempt to address any concerns in a way that satisfies the guest 
without compromising safety or security.  However, due to the size and date of 
construction of our vessel there area some complaints which cannot be resolved 
(e.g. the size of a cabin, removing furniture built into the ship, etc.)  Any 
complaints which are unable to be resolved on board are dealt with by our Guest 
Services Department.  Any complaints, regardless of the nature, are handled the 
same way.  While we acknowledge that some senior Company personnel will 
need to have a basic level of understanding of the responsibilities imposed on a 
vessel operator by the ADA, we suggest that accessibility complaints be handled 
in the same way as all other complaints.

Lastly, regarding the issue of crew assistance there are many occasions in our 
operation where crew assistance is necessary for the safety of both the guests 
and crew, whether they are disabled or not.  For example, when transferring from 
the ship into the inflatable Zodiacs we currently require ALL (crew and guests) to 
take the hand of two other individuals to assist.  Our vessels are certified for 20 
nautical miles off shore and consequently are frequently subject to extreme motion 
in inclement weather.  In these occasions crew often have to assist guests about 
the ship.  Conversely, there are also some situations where it is unsafe for crew to 
provide assistance (e.g. attempting to lift passengers in scooters or move them up 
and down steep stairways in rough weather).  The rule must allow for crew 
assistance where it is deemed appropriate in order to ensure the safety of not only 
our guests, but also our crew.

vessels in Tampa and Clearwater Florida.  Starship employees 50 full time 
employees and another 25-75 seasonal empoyees.  Our cruises consist primarily 
of lunch, brunch and dinner cruises.  We operate year round, however our volume 
of business greatly varies in the different seasons; Spring, Summer, Fall and 
Winter.  The seasonal nature of our business results in a large turnover of 
employees. The  largest dining yacht in our fleet carries 600 passengers and is 
one of the only yachts in its class to have an elevator, built in 1999.  The smallest 
dining yacht carries 150 passengers.

In regards to personnel being trained in ADA accessability matters, we think the 
primary responsibility remains with the Captain of the Yacht.  The USCG licensed 
Captain has the responsiblity to train all crew members for all safety conditions.  
Which include the safe loading and discharging of passengers with disabilities.  
With the many different docks, gangways and tide heights Starship no one 
situation is the same. Boarding and Disembarking of all passengers is the 
responsibility of the Captain and its under his/her direct supervision that this take 
place.  Yacht Starship's safety record and experience with handling passengers 
with disabilities speaks for itself and does not mandate any additional training.

We oppose text telephone messaging for passengers with hearing disabilitites.  
The cost are unknown and in 7-years of operation and 500,000 passengers carried 
to my knowledge we have not had one request for text messaging.

We support any provision that requires advance notice for passengers with 
disabilities.  Vessels are weight sensitive and a disabled passenger may travel 
with equipment that substantially adds to the weight of the passenger.  Each 
vessel has a maximum allowable weight (calculated on a per passenger basis) 
and the Captain must take any additional weight over and above the normal weight 
and subtract it from the total passengers allowed.  Generally the smaller the 
vessel the greater the affect of additional weight from a disabled passenger 
traveling with a lot of support equipment.  Total passengers carried may have to be 
reduced in the event of passengers boarding with substantial additional weight (i.e. 
electric wheelchair), therefore notice should be required.

Yacht Starship docks at undeveloped remote barrier islands along the Florida 
Coast and uses temporary gangways for offloading.  Sometimes placing 
passengers in six inches to 1 feet of water upon offloading and loading.  We 
cannot accomodate passengers with disabilities when operating at these remote 
islands.  We oppose any requirement for accessiblitiy at these remote locations.

ADA complaints should be responded in the same format that we currently 
address customer complaints.  This varies from complaint to complaint based on 
the format (phone, email, fax, written, verbal) of the complaint.  This should be left 
up to the company to respond as it would any other complaint.

We strongly support the crew assisted boarding and disembarking for all 
passengers on our Yachts.  The safe boarding, disembarking and movement of 
passengers is the responsibility of the Captain.  All passenges are evaluated and 
the appropriate assistance is provided.  We currenlty provide more assistance to 
children and elderly passengers than passengers with disabilities.  Please do not 
discourage the safe boarding/disembarking by making any changes to current 
system managed by the Captain of the vessel.

Should you have any questions I am available at your convenience.

Sincerely,

Captain Troy Manthey
President and CEO
Yacht Starship Dining Cruises

on the operation of sailing vessels certificated as passenger vessels.  My wife and I own and 
operate a traditional sailing vessel, the schooner Mary Day, offering week long overnight adventure 
vacations along remote sections of the Maine coast. 

Since I submitted my first comments another summer tourist season has come and gone.  This 
year I have some employees returning and a few new employees as well.  Once again I am in the 
cycle of preparing my crew to safely sail a large vessel with no inboard engine.  Once again we are 
drilling to keep ourselves and our guests safe.  In 8 weeks time this crew will have been through a 
very rigorous training program that includes over 2,000 people hours of maintenance for only a 4 
month revenue generating season.  

I am overwhelmed as I reflect upon the idea that this rule making process may some day require 
this young crew to learn sign language, for instance, or deal with disabilities far beyond the 
practicable means of our current level of service.  The idea that we shall lose the discretion as to 
which disabilities we can safely accommodate in this remote environment seems counter-intuitive.  
The Maine windjammer fleet, composed of 14 historic vessels, some of which are National Historic 
Landmarks, has never turned away reasonable requests for passage from people with disabilities.  
To take away the discretionary powers that the Coast Guard has authorized us to use seems to pit 
one set of federal regulations against another.  Would it not make sense to give small passenger 
vessels the ability to conform where practicable after the Access Board has determined design 
standards for these historic sailing vessels and the disabilities they can safely accommodate on 
discetionary adventure travel vacations?  And when will the SBA have its opportunity to justify that 
the expense these ""mom and pop"" businesses will face is not an undue burden?  Once again I 
invite anyone to come tour our vessels and see first hand the incredible treasure that is the historic 
Maine windjammer sailing fleet found here on the Maine coast and no where else in America.  

While some members of lobbying groups may send form letters lacking any real insight into the 
passenger vessels industry, masters of traditional sailing vessels speak from practical experience 
and genuine concern for the public we serve.  To quote a few of the first round comments ""More and 
more people are coming home with disabilities. Please give these people and all those with 
disabilities the respect they deserve. Make the world more accessible to all!"" ""I support that all 
cruises company USA and International must provide interpreter and close caption on all cruises. 
Please listen.""   While I admire these comments in their intent they offer nothing in the way of 
practical experience with passenger vessels, let alone historic and traditional sailing vessels. At 
what point in time does it makes sense to legislate that all passenger vessels, regardless of means 
of propulsion and all that entails (i.e. angle of incline under normal operating circumstances) must 
accommodate all disabilities with absolutely no regard for the way we operate our vessels in an 
environment that does not discriminate and cannot be tamed by a simplistic and linear rule making 
process.  Asked directly, does lobbying group XYZ want to go sailing safely with knowledgeable 
crew that can safely operate a large traditional sailing vessel or sit at the dock while an intertpreter 
with no experience in traditional sail tells what it is like to feel the wind in the sails. While a crew 
member with broad interpretaive skills, a strong background in traditional sail, and great people 
skills is not impossible to find they are quite rare.  Qualified crew to operate these very unique 
vessels do not appear out of thin air nor can they be trained overnight.  Heck, it takes us at least 8 
weeks just to get themn a TWIC card from the TSA! Hiring additional crew is not financially 
feasible. Again I invite anyone from any lobby to examine my books and tell me how to find the 
money to pay additional crew while losing revenue generating capacity.  

In short, I ask that the DOT use a little common sense and honor practical experience when 
creating broad sweeeping rules that will impact small passenger vessels, traditional and historic 
sailing vessels in particular.  I would hope that those of us whose disabilities have yet to appear 
would deserve the same respect that those with current disabilities ask for in return.

Respectfully submitted,
Captain Barry King
Master, Owner and Operator
Schooner Mary Day

While accomodating disabled persons in public transportation is a basic right, 
some passenger vessels because of their intended use, size, or approved design 
should be exempted from common carrier disability access for the following 
reasons:

1. Small sailing vessels conducting multi day cruises offer an elective vacation in 
which there is an implied a level of mobility, as an integral part of the outdoor 
adventure nature of the experience. In the normal course of their operation sailing 
vessels react to  random forces of wind in strength and direction, causing the craft 
to heel ( incline) and demonstrate irregular motion. The value of the experience 
offered to passengers involves some physical agility, whether in negociating the 
ladders to cabins and facilities below decks, in boarding small boats to row 
ashore,or in landing on deserted beaches or at docks in small fishing harbors we 
visit along the coast. 

2. As National Historic Landmarks, many of the Maine windjammers are subject 
to period review to maintain their landmark status. Thisd is a hard won honor and 
reflects national signifigance. Any modification to meet new accessiblity 
standards would very likely challenge this historic status. Obliging small wooden 
vessels to install ramps, lifts, power driven machinery for access, lower thresholds 
in violation of presdent watertight safety standards.. all these possible impositions 
to address ADA demands would challenge the character and viablitiy and 
authenticity of these unique passenger vessels.

3. The outdoor  nature of windjammer cruises on the Maine coast means that the 
small harbors and conservation islands visited by our passengrs for shore 
explorations are not and in most cases cannot be made handicapped accesible. 
The average tidal range in this area is ten feet: ramps and docks do not meet the 
incline parameters for disability access. Adapting shore landings on national or 
state parks or conservation islands for handicap access would spoil the nature of 
these preserved places.

4. Vessels not engaged as common carriers and not recieving state or federal 
subsidies should be viewed differenetly from ferries that are part of government 
transportation systems.

5. A lower limit breakpoint of 49 ovenight passengers and 100 tons register (Coast 
Guard regulations subchapter T) would be a reasonable upper limit for any new 
ADA regulations for small passneger vessels.

I believe they have a great business
plan and will be servicing many companies as well as families.  Their choice of
aircraft as it pertains to their vision is quite compelling.  To be able to take
one product and have multiple profit centers such as : cargo carrier, food and
beverage in flight for sale, entertainment and wireless access are also money
makers.  They will definitely blow the failing airline companies away in fares.
 The only request, as a consumer, is that we, the passengers are not treated
like cattle as is the case of SW airlines.  I have flown with them for their
lower rates but you get what you pay for, horrific customer service and boarding
like cattle.  SW over books all of their flights, and as a handicapped person, I
happened to be in the bathroom while my cattle group was called ( I have a
bladder disease) and was told my seat was given away even though my co- owner
and a manager of my business were there, they refused to accept that I was in
the bathroom and gave my seat away, after being at the airport 2 hours early,
checking luggage, getting a cattle boarding pass , and was treated very poorly.
In fact we had to file a police report as my partner in business was physically
assaulted by their boarding pass collectors.  He was just trying to make my
case, I was only gone 3 minutes and was not allowed passage.  Instead I was
routed through Reno and had a 4 hour delay , it was  supposed to be a non stop
flight to Portland OR. in 2000. My partner in business, was upset by this poor
treatment and wrote on the barf bag on the way to Reno that ""SW Airlines Bites""
and attached it to his shirt. In Reno they deplaned him, keep in mind we should
have been to Portland long ago at this time, and called the police who refused
to arrest him as no crime was committed.  The customer service manager put him
under citizen's arrest and the police had no choice but to take him to the Reno
sheriff's office.  I deplaned to go bail him out, his first and only arrest(
quasi as it was a citizen's arrest)  We attended a court hearing in Reno and he
was acquitted immediately as he posed no threat, this was pre 9-11.  It cost us
over 3,000 dollars and we intended to sue and then 9-11 happened and we figured
it would be difficult in the state of high alerts to get a jury trial that might
have seen his writing on the barf bag as a threat. what a joke.  They kick
people off for the content of their t- shirts since that time.  Please allow
this family airline to operate as I believe that their business plan is sound
and that they would never treat a passenger as we were treated. I have an
incurable disease, I am handicapped and covered under ADA and they gave my 
seat
away because I had to urinate prior to what could be a long wait for take off. 
This is well thought out with alternative means of profitibility and as long as
they don't cattle herd the passengers and treat the passengers with one ounce of
respect, they will be my new carrier and my company's.
Thank you for your time, and please let this company try to beat the
competition, SW is cheap and illegal in their behaviors, I will never fly with
them again.  Assigned seats would be nice, and double booking should be illegal
if someone has purchased the ticket, checked in their baggage and were there in
plenty of time.  As a matter of fact the people in the last herding made it on
but not me.  ADA discrimination is wrong and SW will go down at some point and
time due to their despicable behavior, especially if I have another choice such
as Family Airlines.  Let them enter the market please, it is much needed.  It is
not like you get fed on SW, but at least on Family Airlines, you have the
opportunity to purchase food, which is really helpful to hypoglycemic customers.

over $1,300 for 3 one way tickets on a low cost carrier so I could go home to take 
care of his funeral.  This, in my opinion, is ridiculous.  A carrier such as Family 
would make it possible for people who have more than one or two people traveling 
to do so on a budget.  This would help boost the economy because when people 
travel they tend to spend a little more freely and the boost in retail sales would be 
a benefit to everyone.  ",,,,,,,

moment because here it is Thanksgiving and Christmas and it has been 3 years 
since I've spent the holidays with my friends and family back home.It would be 
much easier to spend the holidays with them if there were cheaper ways of 
transportation for my husband,our son,and myself to get back east to see 
them.But everywhere I have looked it will cost us 2500.00 or more to go.Alot of 
people unfortunately at this day in age cannot spend nowhere near that kind of 
money.So I absolutely think this airline has a good idea about themselves to 
make airline flights cheap enough to where families and businesses can fly for a 
cheaper price.So I am hoping with all my heart that you allow this airline to get 
liscensed to transport people like my family to see their family members that 
aren't within a driving distance of 9 hrs away when its time for all of us to get 
together to make those special holiday memories that mean so much.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2008-0029-0058/attachment_2.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2008-0029-0058/attachment_1.jpg",

The March 25, 2008, approval of AVIANCA exemption from 49 USC&41301 
(Docket DOT-OST-2008-0106) is a major victory not only for the two nation's 
capital but also for the rapidily increasing US/Colombian residents in the Loudoun 
and Fairfax counties. They would no longer have to endure the more than 8 hours 
trip via other connecting cities along the eastern seabord. The proposed AVIANCA 
non-stop route (4:30 hour) is a blessing, specially as both nations embark in a 
Free Trade Agreement (FTA). My congratulations to the Department decisive and 
quick approval.

Respectfully yours,

for the following reasons:

Hubs Will Be Eliminated
All the major airlines operate a hub and spoke system. A combination of two or 
more airlines will create a redundancy of hubs, forcing the closure or substantial 
reduction in flights at some hubs. This will lead to a great loss of jobs at not only 
the airlines involved, but also at the dozens of service companies that support 
airline operations in hub cities. 

Service Frequency Will Be Reduced
If two airlines merge, frequency of flights between cities they both serve will be 
reduced. A major goal of airline mergers is to reduce capacity, which means fewer 
seats available for travelers.

Competition Will Be Diminished
Fewer airlines and fewer flights mean fewer choices for consumers. This leads to 
higher fares. 

Jobs Will Be Lost
Airline employees lost jobs after the 9/11 attacks.  They lost jobs after painful 
bankruptcies.  Mergers are just another avenue for airlines to cut even more jobs. 
This will lead to increased unemployment, as well as a reduction in taxes paid by 
airline workers and less money spent in their communities.

Customer Service Will Deteriorate Further
Customer service in the airline industry is legendary, legendarily poor. Merging 
two major airlines will force executives to pour resources into integrating the two 
companies and two different corporate cultures. This means customer service will 
not be a focus the combined airline.

Pension Obligations Will Be Jeopardized
Many airlines have frozen or terminated pension plans. If a merger takes place 
between two major airlines with company-sponsored pension plans, and the 
combined airline ultimately fails, the pensions will be forced onto the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). If, for example, a Delta-Northwest 
combination failed, the PBGC would be burdened with more than $7 billion in 
liabilities. The PBGC has already expressed concerns about such a scenario.

A Merger Will Do Nothing to Lower Fuel Prices
Airlines cite high fuel prices as a reason to merge, but the cost of a gallon of fuel 
for two individual airlines will be the same as for one large airline. 

If airline executive spent as much time running the airline and improving their 
product as they do searching for the next big deal, the industry would be better for 
passengers, employees and the communities the airlines serve. I hope you will 
speak out against the consolidation of major U.S. airlines.

risk the safe harbor of NWA built on the massive paycuts of it's employees. It
will reduce service to small towns served by NWA. It will drive up air fares.
This merger is a get rich scheme by NW executives who have demonstrated time 
and
time again that they do not have the best interest of the company at hand.

This merger is being driven by Hedge Funds (unregulated, and manipulating the
BOD of both companies) It is being driven by NWA BOD Chairman Roy Bostock, 
who
was put in place for the specific purpose of selling NW to Delta. It is being
driven by NWA CEO Doug Steenland who stands to profit by $22 million dollars.

Delta Airlines has a long history of being anti union, it has already
demonstrated it's intent to de-unionize NW (evident by the assistance given by
NW in the firing of 5000 NW mechanics in bankruptcy)

This merger is bad for NWA employees, the communities it serves, and the flying
public.",,,,,,,

really dont like the ideas of having northwest being bought and be called delta for 
some reasons. 1) northwest is an internationally recongized company that are 
being recongized and accepted by many around the world while delta is strictly a 
domestic carrier. 2) both japanese and chinese governments have recongized 
northwest as the airlines that they have agreed and accept to let them into their 
respective japanese and chinese cities whereas northwest have served for more 
than 60 years now. delta lacks that and both governments dont recongize delta. 3)
northwest have more experiences particlarly in pilots that they knew and maintain 
their reputations and practies whereas they have done for years of bring 
customers anywhere in the world. 4)Northwest have managed their budgets and 
fleet very well and responsible whereas delta dont. In conclusion, If you 
government, the justice dept, congress people take harder look at that knew that 
northwest have better reputation and recongizations than delta, to make merger 
more properly accepted that it should be therefore be called northwest instead of 
delta for many reasons as shown above. I am sure that you would have fully 
agreed with me on that one. ",,,,,,,

information to the State CDL licensing authorities. I make that recommendation
because there are only a handful of MRO's in each state typically assisting with
positive drug test reviews and the chances of a report being made by an MRO is
much more likely, with a higher degree of accuracy.  Actually Alabama would
prefer to receive the information directly from the MRO who is viewed as an
independent third-party professional.  Additionally, under the procedure which
Alabama is considering, a SAP or MRO may need to be in a position to release
information to the State CDL licensing authorities relative to license
reinstatement and continued compliance with follow-up testing.  Alabama is
considering a procedure whereby upon receipt of notice of a positive drug test,
the CDL driver’s license is temporarily suspended and reinstated on a medically
restricted basis once a negative return to duty test has been very performed and
reported to the State CDL licensing authorities.  The CDL driver would then be
issued a medically restricted CDL license with the restriction being removed
upon notification of the successful completion of follow-up testing. Because
many times these positive drug test drivers have been terminated by the
employer, it is critical to allow other ""service agents"" to provide this notice
to the State CDL licensing authorities.  I am also aware that other positive
drug test state reporting statutes require reporting by the MRO.  My second
comment is that you also refer to ""state regulations"" and not just ""state laws""
as you currently have.  If you will merely add ""State laws and State
Regulations"" that will allow Alabama to swiftly consider implementation of a
regulation. I wish to applaud your office for the innovative approach to help
States remove drunk and drugged drivers from the roadways of America. Tommy
Eden, Attorney, Capell & Howard, PC Montgomery, Alabama
As I propose the regulation would read as follows: 
40.331 (g) Notwithstanding any provision of this Part, Service Agents are
authorized to comply with State laws and State regulations requiring you to
provide to State CDL licensing authorities information about all violations of
DOT drug and alcohol testing rules (including positive drug test and refusals)
by any CMV driver holding a CDL, as well as information concerning a CDL
driver's subsequent compliance with return to duty and follow-up testing.

[Docket Number—DOT–OST–2008–0196]
Renewal of Approval of Information Collection Requirements
OMB Control No.: 2100–0019

Recently I learned that the Program “Llame y Viaje” from the Metropolitan Bus 
Authority in Puerto Rico was experiencing a State of Emergency when their fleet 
of 45 vehicles broke down to 5 vehicles.

From this notification I went to the phone to ask the office of the Ombudsman of 
Persons with Disabilities in Puerto Rico of other choices for the Community of 
Persons with Disabilities in the area to travel.

They offer the following information:
787-758-3514 “Transportación Accesible” no respond
787-449-2999 Taxi Left a message 
Wheelchairs get away 787-726-4023 phone disconnected 
1-800-868-8028 Raphael but this number left me with an odd taste for his service
787-784-8050 Van Rental disconnected 
The phone number 1-800-868-8028 was answered by Mr. Rafael which describe to 
me his service and sounded to me as a bully which does not has a license with 
DTOP or the Commission.

I decided not to engage him because what he told me on the phone was not 
appropriate.

Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance is a major factor in San Juan 
Puerto Rico.  This company with phone number 1-800-868-8028 is private 
company and he assured me that he does not had to comply with the ADA Law.  

There is a misconception in Puerto Rico for privately operated over-the-road buses 
(OTRBs) as required by the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) of 1990 and the 
information is reaching neither the territory nor the customers.

If there is an Over-the-Road Buses in Puerto Rico recordkeeping and reporting are 
important.  I believe that the 48 hour advance notice and compensation can be 
used to leave the Person with Disability stranded in many ways plus it can be 
dangerous too.

I believe that the second change should not be question, when the transportation 
services in Puerto Rico are so unreliable.  For a person with Multiple Sclerosis it 
can be deadly.  Since heat exacerbate to MS.  The service has to be equivalent 
service to the compensation only after the service only. 

The third change should not be discouraged in Puerto Rico.  Keeping track of 
services should be a requirement.  Report information on ridership on accessible 
fixed route buses should be mandatory. 

In Puerto Rico the local politics tends to destroy everything and to make my point 
the recordkeeping should be extend to 8 years. 

The fifth which has to do with report submission to DOT annually should be 
mandatory.  Is this done to the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation 
(PRDOT) or the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT)? 

The sixth that has to do with reporting information on the purchase and lease of 
accessible and inaccessible new and used buses should be done on situations 
immediately.  Right now the program from the Metropolitan Bus Authority in San 
Juan “Llame y Viaje” is experiencing a State of Emergency when the fleet broke 
down.

The collection of information should be still promoted to far to reach territories of 
the United States.  The agency does not have a way to have inspections on a 
round of clock basis.  The Federal Funds used for these services should be 
audited because the services render are not complying with the ADA.  

The exercise of surprise visits should be encourage because the ADA Law is to 
be enforce 100% in all the territories of the United States.

We should encourage the practice to not to believe that the agencies, states or 
territories to timed necessary to comply with the information collection 
requirements.  They should comply with reports, accounting and audits on a 
timely basis to make sure that the funds are reaching the needy community.  

Estimates from bus operators should not be encouraged compliance must be 
done.   Reporting rates have not been done in Puerto Rico. The purpose of the 
information collection requirements is to provide data that the Department can use 
in reviewing the provisions of its rule and to assist both the Department and the 
state, territory, etc. in its oversight of compliance by bus companies. 

The data should be use to assist the Department in conducting the reevaluation of 
the requirements of the over-the-road bus rule mentioned in the regulation itself.   

Mr. Robert C. Ashby my late husband was an accountant and auditor and it is my 
interpretation that your federal agencies have not being diligent with the 
requirement of reports from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  Citizens of 
Persons with Disabilities are suffering the consequences.  

I lived in Puerto Rico for three years.  Three years of suffering thanks to the 
sloppiness of the bus employees and the administration.  Lack of knowledge is 
not an excuse Mr. Robert C. Ashby in this modern date and age.  Your agency 
should revise the requirements with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and all the 
other territories should comply with the ADA Law.

Stopping this require paper work can only make easy the corruption on the 
island.  The 2000 Census showed that the population on the island of Persons 
with Disabilities is more than 26.8%.  I have multiple sclerosis ( MS) and heat 
does not do us well and living in a country as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 
where MS is just a new kid on the block and services are of no existence does 
not make our lives easy.  

I had to move back to the United States because live in Puerto Rico was difficult.  
I had to stop driving in the year 2003 due to my MS.  I have a child to take care 
Mr. Ashby.  This should have been a concept understood by the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico but still today the representative in the Metropolitan Bus Authority 
puzzles herself for my complaint to the  United State Department of 
Transportation DOT # 2005-0030.

Your agency should make the requirements Sir.

inadequate given our current circumstances.  There is virtually no mention of non-
motorized modes save for the cursory mention of bike and pedestrian safety as 
one of 9 priority areas.  How can this be a priority if there isn't a single mention 
thereafter of bike and pedestrian modes?  Continued focus on only automobiles 
will do nothing to address the safety implications of non-motorized modes sharing 
the roadways, especially as their numbers increase as is being seen as a result 
of high gas prices.

Further, given the current gas prices, isn't it about time we actually got serious 
about facilitating and encouraging bicycling as a mode of transportation?  Our 
national infrastructure is so lacking in complete, connected and safe non-
motorized transportation networks that most people won't think twice about it as a 
mode of transport.  This document further ignores the matter, thereby continuing 
to give precedence to autos despite our continued claims that we need to reduce 
our depedence on private autos.

Lastly, the over-simplified consolidation of of the many programs now in existence 
into a relative handful of categories will not eliminate them, nor the need for 
separate programs and funding mechanisms.  It is simply a shell game 
constructed to make this plan look as though it cleans up a bureaucratic 
spiderweb of programs, funding streams, etc.  In reality they will simply become 
sub-categories and remain in existence.  It is akin to Homeland Defense, the 
biggest bureaucracy ever created, all under the guise of streamlining and 
downsizing of government.

Mr. Miller wrote:

'It would undoubtedly be the ideal standard of travel if everyone were able and 
could afford to execute all his movements in his own car, with complete safety, 
free from all traffic annoyance and delay and have a doorman take and deliver the 
car whenever the need for parking arose. BUT UNLESS IT IS PROPOSED THAT 
WE FIRST WRECK FROM STEM TO STERN THE PRESENT PATTERN OF CITY 
STREETS WHICH WE HAVE INHERITED, WE KNOW THAT NO SUCH TRAFFIC 
UTOPIA IS POSSIBLE EVEN IF OUR NATIONAL ECONOMY COULD AFFORD 
IT. I conceive the only adequate approach to a lasting solution of the problem to be 
a comprehensive attack upon the broad and fundamental, though basically 
unsound practice which brings about this condition. The guilty culprit is the 
excessive and uneconomical use of the private automobile for daily travel to and 
from home and place of work or other occupation. It is not my idea that there 
should be less ownership of automobiles, but that those who have no need for their 
cars for their daily activities should leave them at home, and avail themselves of 
public carrier facilities'.
 
Mr. Miller gave a chilling hint of things to come,

In the USA the cities have been wrecked beyond recognition, the transit systems 
and railways have mostly vanished and now the world has to deal with a nation 
with 5% of its worlds population thirsting for more than 20% of its petroleum to 
support a destructive automobile traffic utopia.

Instead of drill-drill-drill,guzzle-guzzle-guzzle,slurp-slurp-slurp,drive-drive-drive,how 
about some FAST TRAINS?

Detroit, Michigan, USA.In its peak years more or less 125-150 passenger trains 
operated service between Detroit-New York-Chicago-Toledo and points South-East-
West and service North to Toronto-Montreal via a tunnel under the Detroit River.

The Station was designed as an intermodal facility, and that is a plus. It is located 
adjacent to major highways and approx 30 miles from Detroit Metro International 
Airport. There are rail-lines running alongside the airport. Rennovation and 
restoration of railway service woukld be a costly endeavor, but there is something 
related to rail travel that I think could take off like a rocket ship! 

Here it is briefly: An Auto-train-passenger service would enable Americans (who 
are afraid to give up their cars), to travel by train to far away destinations knowing 
that their cars are close to them in one of the following rail-cars and will be 
available for them after arrival at their final destinations.

The extremely heavy automobile traffic on Interstate 75 between Detroit and 
Florida could be the reason to justify an auto-train service. Millions of people own 
homes and cottages in Michigan and condominiums, apartment & homes in 
Florida and the various states in between.

The transport of thousands of cars daily via VIRGIN AUTO-TRAIN USA would help 
reduce a substantial amount of air pollution.

railway system. The US railways utilized a combination of fuels such as coal, oil, 
wood, & hydroelectric to power steam, electric & diesel railroad systems.

Total track mileage for passenger & freight service was approximately 300,000 
miles, with more than 50,000 passenger & freight terminals & stations giving 
anyone an almost infinite amount of routes from point A to B or C etc... Today, a 
mere skeleton of that system exists, named AMTRAK, meagerly & with route 
mileage of approximately 21,000 miles,(US track mileage prior to the Civil War)!

The colossal appetite for motor fuels is a direct result of the dismantlement of the 
US railway system in total favor of a motorized highway network and total

titled: “Refocus. Reform. Renew.” contains many interesting ideas about how we 
should manage transportation in the United States in the future. However, it does 
not express anything like a guiding vision that one expects from a policy overhaul. 
The true focus of this document is the business of how we pay for transportation, 
not what or why we should do to plan for the next 25 years of transportation in our 
country.

The central point of the entire document appears to be the concept of removing the 
gasoline fuel tax as a primary way of funding highway maintenance. Along the 
way, it refers obscurely to the efficiencies of other modes and the need to 
alleviate “congestion” in our system. The “System” here is obviously primarily 
thought of as the Interstate highway System. It pays short shrift to other modes of 
rail, air, and transit. The “vision” really does not provide a roadmap for the future in 
any sort of clear terms. As a policy map, the document is as clear as the muddy 
Mississippi. The document reads like something an accountant would write after 
receiving orders to draft a funding strategy based on guidance provided by a “real” 
policy document.

I ask here: “did anyone in DOT actually read or comprehend all the myriad studies 
of capacity shortfalls either here already or soon to arrive for ALL modes”? Does 
anyone in DOT comprehend the implications and possible unintended 
consequences of demand pricing of highway use and deleting the fuel tax? Does 
anyone in DOT comprehend the need to reduce the use and conserve hydrocarbon 
fuels for all the reasons too obvious to enumerate here? I suspect DOT does 
understand all of these overriding issues, but why have they not addressed them 
point-by-point in terms of an overall Federal policy? 

Where is the vision for transit? Where is the vision for commuters? Where is the 
vision for alleviating the coming massive shortfall in rail freight capacity? Where is 
the vision for repairing and maintaining bridges? Where is the vision for building 
first class highways and bridges instead of the band aid approach we typically 
take in the United States? Does anyone in DOT comprehend that if you build it 
better, the overall cost to own may be significantly lower over the lifetime of the 
system than what we currently do?

I appreciate the amount of work it took to write the “policy” document, but as vision 
and policy for the future it is sadly lacking. Please try again, next time with a 
higher level perspective, then allow the accountants to take over and propose 
various alternatives to pay for the vision.

After twice attempting to wade through this latest ""plan"" developed by your 
agency, I have a sincere question:

How do you live with yourself?!

To borrow from the text...

The approach as outlined will not alleviate congestion, nor will it fight 
gridlock - now or later. It is not visionary, not multi-modal, not policy 
oriented. It is not innovative, effective, or efficient. It fails to adequately 
address mobility, economy, or quality of life issues. There are no ""new ideas"" 
presented.

It is, in fact, a complete waste of taxpayer's money.

At this juncture, I should also state that your concern about ""eroding 
confidence in government"" is invalid, since many of us have essentially given up on 
our elected officials and their appointees to do anything substantive 
regarding transportation, energy or environmental matters.

My sheer disgust knows no bounds.

I would say, ""go back to the drawing board""...if I thought it would do any 
good. As it stands, my only hope is that a change in administration will both 
bring railway-based transportation technologies to the forefront and relieve 
you of your duties.

go far enough.  I do believe that we need more reform and need to better utilize the 
funding that is brought into the transportation trust fund.  But we still need to find a 
way to increase funding at the same time.  I think one thing that the government 
doesn’t take into account when it comes to transportation, is that transportation is 
an investment to the government and to the country.  Transportation is the life 
blood of the economy.  When we invest in transportation, we invest in the 
economy.  Lost dollars in the economy for commuting are saved.  Less time on 
the road means less fuel needed in our vehicles which is better for our environment 
and decreases our need for oil and energy.  Lost time for trucks and trains 
carrying freight is recovered, allowing more deliveries and lowering the costs for 
products.  More transportation construction projects means more jobs for all 
working class people, from the professional engineers (which I am) to the unskilled 
laborer.  And more capacity also means more growth, so that more businesses 
are built and more houses are erected.  I am in favor for a revenue increase in 
transportation, although I would be happy for starters if the gas tax would at least 
reflect the value of the dollar through inflation.  That would mean that the gas tax 
would keep up with inflation, in a similar fashion as the what the postal services 
are doing with the cost of stamps.

There is no other area that the government funds that sees as large of a return in 
its investment as the funding of transportation.  It is time that we streamline the 
way we work in the transportation industry to maximize its efficiency.  But it is 
also time to realize that funding transportation is a huge investment for the country 
that affects our lives in so many ways directly and indirectly, and we need to make 
sure that we increase the funding in a way that we maximize the investment.

Two, I agree that the interstate system needs maintenance, but what about new 
interstates to connect areas to help with congestion?  Many changes have taken 
place since the 50's and 60's, especially with residential and industrial growth in

The proposed ""Metropolitan Innovation Fund"" seems to me like a sure way for the 
federal government to hand out more money with less accountability. Already we 
are spending twice as much to get three times as much congestion, does this 
mean we need to build the highways three times as large? No part of the proposal 
that I can discern addresses this. Safety seems to be another large issue but 
there are no proposals that would seem to significantly affect the mortality on our 
highways. There also seems to be some awareness that oil for fuel needs to be 
changed but again no proposals on the scale necessary to do anything about it. 
Technology will supposedly cure the above ills but how? If we were to automate 
the entire road/rail system in America, power it with wind and solar energy, and 
populate it with on-demand personal vehicles, all of the above problems would go 
away or at least be much reduced. All of he technology required is in use today, 
yet where is the discussion about doing this? Any real improvement to our nations 
transportation structure must be done by the federal government, otherwise many 
states and municipalities just will not do it, as should be obvious by our current 
problems. Finally, I agree the 13 year process is entirely too long, in that amount 
of time we should be well underway in building an automated system if people 
actually want to do something serious to address our problems.",,,,,,,

NTSB reviews jet's skid landing at O'Hare 
By Alan Levin, USA TODAY

The pilots of an American Airlines flight carrying 185 passengers were
forced to make an unusual emergency landing last month in Chicago with
limited ability to control the jet after they lost electrical power,
according to newly released information from a federal investigation. 
The Boeing 757 skidded off a runway at O'Hare International Airport on
Sept. 22, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said. Although
none of the 192 people aboard was injured, the pilots flew on backup
battery power for long beyond the 30 minutes that their emergency
handbook said the batteries would last, the NTSB said. 

The pilots of the Seattle-to-New York flight drained the jet's battery
backup system, leaving inoperable vital systems that help stop a jet,
according to a preliminary report released this week. 

The pilots told investigators they had difficulty raising and lowering
the jet's nose and felt they had only one chance to land, the NTSB said.

""They should have landed as soon as practical,"" said Michael Barr, an
instructor at the University of Southern California's Aviation Safety
and Security Program. ""That would have been the conservative approach. I
don't see why they thought they could fly all the way across country on
their backup electrical system.""

The pilots had switched to battery power shortly after leaving Seattle
when electrical problems developed. The batteries last for about 30
minutes, but the pilots continued toward their destination until the
jet's electrical systems began failing about an hour and 40 minutes
later.

The need to land as soon as possible when aircraft systems begin to fail
has been reinforced by several accidents, such as Swiss Air Flight 111
in 1998, Barr said. The Swiss Air pilots attempted to diagnose where
smoke was coming from before deciding to divert, Canadian investigators
concluded. The jet became engulfed in fire and crashed off Nova Scotia,
killing all 229 people aboard. 

Last month, the American Airlines pilots had to stop the jet without
thrust reversers and other devices that help a jet stop, the NTSB said.
The electrical system failure was so complete that the pilots were
unable to shut off the engines after they came to a stop, the report
said. 

Barr said investigators will want to know what the airline's manuals and
emergency documentation instructed pilots to do, what the airline's
maintenance department advised the pilots to do and how pilots were
trained to handle electrical malfunctions. 

American and its pilots union, the Allied Pilots Association, declined
to comment while the case is under investigation.
