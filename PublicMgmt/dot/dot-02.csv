It is not clear that if new parts are installed would inspections under the AD still continue?  If a brand new spar is installed would inspections still be required? Every year? Longer time frames?

Simply put, the plethora of new mandates promulgated by the regulating agency, and Congress that must be adheared to and accomplished by our industry within a relatively short period has a devestating financial effect on operators, especially those that  have invested the most in their companies and  own all the aircraft they operate.
Each upcoming requirement in itself has a significant impact on the Air Taxi industry, cumulatively, they will destroy many smaller employers, and cause a great many lost jobs.

We simply cannot continue to pay for one government mandate after another. We have for instance one Lear 35A, that will be subject to the following costly mandates in short order:  TSA, RSVM, Increased Customs Bond Requirements, Ground Proximity Warning Equipment, and Collision Avoidance Equipment.  Total Cost of Compliance?  including downtime..easily $500,000.
Now, our company is a 14 year old Part 135 operation, and has a perfect safety record.  The only results I believe we will see in all of this is losss of customers during the extensive downtimes for installations, and an inability to justify the investment, hence our exit from turbine operations.  
Just how long does the federal government estimate it will take a small company like mine to recoup $500,000 in this industry?, for a single aircraft?  I'll tell you how long... about 10 years to break even, and that's in the unlikely event that no more costly regulatory mandates are forced upon our industry.  
I understand that we may be able to operate below 29,000 ft and above 40,000 ft...first, operating costs at lower altitudes are prohibitive.
There are not many flight levels above the bracketed altitudes, and the lengths of many trips would make climbing all the way thru the 30's impractical.  Further, the result of this propsal is going to have the opposite effect of that hoped for.  Traffic will be compressed below 30,000 ft creating a much greater degree of congestion in the 20-29 flight levels, and constant requests for altitudes in the upper 20's that will not be able to be fullfilled due to saturation....causing turbine operators such as us to have to fly at even lower FL's where operation becomes economiclly unfeasible while at the same time requiring a much greater workload on ATC, and much greater delays in the system. 
I see this proposal as it stands as a lose lose proposition for employers in the industry, their employees, the safety of the traveling public  who aren't priveledged to use the bracketed FL's and ATC with increased workload, and delays caused by saturation at various flight levels.
Further, technology, I believe, is advanced enough to maintain reduced seperation today, without the neccessity of the installation of such expensive equipment...and with the already mandated Collision Avoidance equipment required for the cockpit, safety margins should be enhanced.

This proposal is so strongly supported by the Airlines, who fly established routes on a repeated basis because  they see it as a means to remove traffic from their prefered FL's and reducing their delays. What about the rest of us?  This is a classic example of robbing Peter to pay Paul. We will reduce delays and congestion at certain FL's only to increase them at others.   
Obviously, General Aviation and on demand Aircharter would stand to benefit the most from the free flight concept. However the cost of taking advantage of it makes it unfeasible. 

The net effect in all of this is going to be negligible for the system, and extremely costly to the operator, unless or until a system is developed that will allow this activity at a cost to operators that is economiclly feasible enough to allow them to take advantage of it. 
I'm sure that the major corporations, the time share aircraft industry, and Warren Buffet can afford this.
Those of us who have struggled to grow our businesses over years, investing every penny back into them to grow them are being devestated by this never ending parade of rule making mandating extremely expensive, and safety negligible requirements.  I fear that in all of this, all we will do is cause aircrews to have their heads stuck evermore in a downward position in the cockpit, relying more and more on technological means for safety, rather than good advanced planning, good judgement, human control, and observation.
We are creating a system designed to the lowest common denominator....and we will create an atmosphere that encourages performance to that level.  Systems malfunction, and they cause people to become lax in their preperation, planning and vigilance.  When a situation presents itself hesitation will become a problem....""gee my system doesn't show that conflict"". Air transportation is the safest system of travel in the world....as we move farther and farther from reliance on well trained individuals constantly honing judgement and reaction skills....and the absolute neccessity for thorough advanced planning, we will create a whole new set of problems for ourselves.  Redundancy is smart.  Relying on it as a crutch is not...the human condition is such that once relied upon, systems become a crutch, and a rationale to cut corners in many peoples minds.
We have nearly eliminated accidents in turbine aircraft...we will NEVER eliminate them all together. The sheer addition of complex system after complex system is a threat to safety in itself.

No one has more systems, more redundancy, and more monitoring capability than NASA....how does their overall safety record stack up to turbine aircraft operations on ratio basis?
How complex do we intend to make our on board systems?  How much can people be expected to monitor, before some of the critical safety duties of the crew begin to suffer, at the expense of others less likely to present conflict on a frequent basis?
I urge the Agency to drop this proposal until such time as a system can be developed that is not cost prohbitive to operators, and economiclly unfeasible. 
We will not solve any problems overall going down this road, and that is what our goal needs to be.  The concept is outstanding, the potential enormus, the plan as it stands however is not affordable...we need systems that require lower cost operator investment.  We can't give up 3 years margin, for every proposal that comes along, you now have us up to 10 years.  This is nonsensical.

Pending mandates should be judged with the cumulative burden promulgated on the Indusrtry over a 10 year period, including all other mandates proposed or already approved over the period, regardless of the agency proposing the burden. Looking at each proposals economic burden independently DOES NOT present the true picture of the consequences we are causing ourselves economiclly.  None ever seem totally devestating in themselves...cumulative impact presents a whole other story. 
We will eventually eliminate the small business sector from this industry...the day is not that far away.  Perhaps that is the goal.  
Enough is enough. 

Respectfully Submitted,
Craig Devenport, president

From: Lawton Roberts

Subject: AIRFARE PRICE DISCRIMINATION, WEB-ONLY AIRFARES VERSUS CRS AIRFARES

On December 11th, I sent out a call-to-action to travel agents in over 30 states who had registered on the website www.TravelAgentsofAmerica.com asking them to submit specific examples of airfare disparities between prices quoted in CRS's and prices quoted on the same itinerary in airline website data bases such as delta.com, ual.com, nwa.com, aa.com, and orbitz.com.  This new call-to-action was based on a very enlightening meeting I had in Washington with the U. S. Department of Transportation in early December.  Now, on February 6, 2002, I am repeating this call to action, with one significant difference.  From now until the proposed revisions to the CRS regulations are published by the DOT in March, 2002, this specific call-to-action needs to be an on-going effort by all travel agents.  In football, it's called PILING ON!!!  Every time you or your staff encounters a specific example of fare disparity, whether it is first identified by your staff or one of your customers, you need to take the time to print all screens from all data sources and send it in to the DOT, per the instructions that follow.  This can be a weekly mailing of all such examples compiled during the week.  Simply prepare your cover letter once, and reuse it with a current date each time you send your examples to the DOT.  This material is definitely reaching the proper authorities, and is being considered in the revisions that are now underway to the CRS Regulations that are long overdue for rewrite.  The more examples you can provide together with your own concerns about this discriminatory and predatory impact on your business, the better our industry's chances of having this particular problem corrected by the DOT in 2002, through regulatory means.  Through my numerous trips to Washington on behalf of travel agents, I have been advised by both Senate and House counsel familiar with this problem that the DOT has the authority under existing law to correct this problem through regulatory means, without the need for any new legislation.  And the CRS regulations are the logical place to deal with it. By simply classifying Orbitz as a CRS, as Canada's Transport Union has done, this problem would be corrected, since under existing DOT regulations in the United States, airfares provided by the airlines to one CRS must also be provided to all other CRS's.

BACKGROUND TO THIS CALL-TO-ACTION:  For those who are new to Travel Agents of America, let me give you some background that led to the need for this specific action on your part.  In my meeting with the DOT in early December, I learned that the DOT had sent out what is known as an ANPRM in 1997, (Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making), to invite input to possible changes to the federal regulations that govern CRS's.  I knew that there had been much trade press written about CRS rule changes several years ago, but it had seemed to just go nowhere.  I was advised that the new DOT administration under Secretary Mineta was the reason that finally rewriting the CRS regulations had suddenly become a priority.  The DOT representatives advised me that one of the issues they were considering addressing was the issue of web fares that are excluded from CRS databases, the implications on the public, travel agents and airlines.  I informed them that Expedia had just fought for and received a favorable ruling from the European Union on web fares in the European community that were about to be in the European equivalent of Orbitz, Oboto.  Now, fares offered in Oboto must be offered in travel agent databases through CRS's as well.  I also advised them that the Canadian Transport Union had ruled that fares offered in Orbitz would also have to be offered in CRS's to Canadian Travel Agencies.  Orbitz is not yet available on line to the public in Canada, so I am told.  So web fares are not yet available to CRS subscribers in Canada.  As to the timetable for the process of CRS rulemaking and eventual implementation of any CRS rule changes, the U. S. DOT is currently in the process of rewriting the CRS regulations, and plans to publish a draft version to the public by the end of March 2002, as an NPRM, (Notice of Proposed Rule Making).  Then follows 60 days of invited comments from any and all affected parties, including travel agents, airlines, CRS's, and consumer advocates, then a final internal DOT review based on the feedback to the proposed rules, then the publication of a Final CRS Rule Change, followed by a period of allowing for all parties to make needed system or procedural changes in order to meet compliance by a certain deadline.  Optimistically, the DOT hopes to implement the revised CRS regulations by no later than the end of 2002.

Following my meeting with the DOT in December, I requested and received a favorable ruling that allows travel agents to provide individual comments or concerns about the unfair price discrimination issue NOW, although the published deadline for DOT receipt of invited comments in response to the DOT's Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule-Making had already passed.  In addition, whenever the NPRM is published this spring along with the initial version of the proposed CRS rule changes, we along with others will be invited to submit our comments again, based on the proposed revisions, whether they are favorable to travel agents or not.  I will keep you advised of this very important event and opportunity whenever it occurs.  So once again, it's time for action.  Here is your individual opportunity to express your concerns about web-only fares direct to the people in our federal government who can do something about it, and in fact are considering that very thing.  Because of Travel Agents of America, once again you have an opportunity to you're YOUR VOICE heard in Washington, unfiltered by any third party.  NOW IS THE TIME TO TAKE ACTION, AS FOLLOWS:

TRAVEL AGENTS OF AMERICA

NEW  CALL-TO-ACTION  February 6, 2002

(Even if you have participated in this call-to-action before in late December or in January, consider this a new strategy to bombard the DOT in Washington over the next several weeks with specific examples of airfare price discrimination.  Travel agency documentation on this problem that the DOT has received to date is now beginning to get serious attention and consideration during the CRS rule making process that is now underway at the DOT.  Now is the time to flood the DOT with specific examples of this serious threat to the travel agent industry.  Now is the time to PILE ON!!!)

YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO CONVEY YOUR PERSONAL CONCERNS TO THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION ABOUT THE IMPACT TO YOU OF THE AIRLINE PRACTICE OF AIRFARE PRICE DISCRIMINATION BY WITHHOLDING WEB-ONLY AIR FARES FROM TRAVEL AGENT CRS'S:

1.      STEP ONE:  Gather specific printed examples of airfare price discrimination comparing web-only fares quoted on airline web sites plus Orbitz plus your CRS.  Make printouts from all three sources for each example.  Label each one clearly so that anyone can easily compare the three sources of fare quotes for the same itinerary, airline, etc.  Be sure to compare base fares to base fares, as Orbitz does not break it out.  Find at least two or three examples.  I am sure you can find examples that show fare disparities of well over 20% between quotes. Recently, our agency identified a difference of 90%, or $1,500 between a CRS fare and an airline website fare.

2.      STEP TWO:  Write a cover letter on your letterhead expressing your concern about the airline practice of withholding the lowest airfares from your business, its impact both to you and to your customers, and why you believe it to be unfair competition.  Make a copy of all your correspondence and attachments, and file for possible later reference, if contacted by the DOT.  The heading of your cover letter should look something like this:

BEFORE THE 
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
WASHINGTON, D. C.

February XX,  2002

COMMENTS OF THE
XYZ TRAVEL AGENCY, INC.
IN THE MATTER OF
DOCKET #2881, CRS RULE MAKING 

3.      Send the cover letter with your attachments by overnight courier or by U. S. Mail.  I have been assured that overnight courier services like Federal Express are getting through almost without delay.  U. S. Mail is getting through, but with some delay.  Send to:

a.      United States Department of Transportation
b.      Docket Section
c.      Reference Docket #2881, CRS Rule Making
d.      400 7th Street, SW
e.      Washington, D. C. , 20590
f.      For a phone number on the overnight air bill, use 202-366-8822
g.      For a dept, use ""Docket Section""

You can expect that I will follow this entire process of CRS rulemaking over the next 12 months and that I will alert you at each opportunity to participate in it as the process allows, now that we know that such a process is underway!

I hope that every travel agent in America will take advantage of this important call-to-action.  With each new visit or phone call to Washington, I am learning more about how the process (in Washington) works and where your most productive efforts need to be focused.  But it's up to you to individually do your part in helping to make positive changes in our industry.  No longer can we sit by on the sidelines and expect someone else to deal with these critically important issues on our behalf, even if we paid them to.

Please tell other travel agents in your area how they too can get involved in fighting for the future of the travel agent industry by simply enlisting on the website www.TravelAgentsofAmerica.com.

There is zero confidence in the system as it is today.

I propose that all fares be made available to all accredited distribution sources without prejudice.

My main complaint is that online travel sites, particularly Orbitz, list air fares well below what an agent can sell. Since Orbitz is owned by the airlines, these Web fares are unfair and violate CRS contract rules.  For this reason, I am asking the DOT to subject online travel sites (particularly Orbitz) to the same CRS rules that the airline-owned CRSs have been required to follow. Orbitz, actual operations present competitive issues and I have a profound concern regarding the airline's practice of withholding lowest air fares not only from agents, but from anyone without access to a computer: I believe that all fares should be available, regardless of the technology used. It puts all agents in a very awkward situation, when a client informs us that they can acquire a lower airfare on the Internet. Also, I feel it is unethical to withhold these fares from those who are not computer savy. I have encountered an enormous loss of productivity in attempting to meet or beat the fares that my clients can acquire (on their own) by using the Internet. Furthermore, this creates confusion and distrust to the agent-client relationship. Please consider the impact that the Internet has had in airline distribution and extend the current CRS rules to to Internet.

Orbitz must be under the same guidlines as anyone else who sells through CRS. Orbitz has caused numerous problems with my clients. I quote Jani Miller, CEO Central Travel, ""Our concern about this marketplace reality is huge. The immediate impact on the customer is comfustion, distrust, loss of productivity and, at times, mothing more than a marketing ploy."" I wholeheartedly agree. I don't see how the airlines are allowed to withhold the lowest fare from the general public. Most of my clients in rural Georgia don't have internet access and can not even purchase these tickets themselves. Of course, my corporate clients have access to computers, but spend more time questioning the fares from the airlines to which we have access, than is necessary. I understand the need for competitive marketing, but if you have someone out there selling for you, why undersell them? You only create confusion and make the agents as well as the client distrust the airlines.

i am in jeopardy of losing my job because of the internet. my hours have been cut to 24hrs a week.
i have been searching the internet to see what the customers see, to my suprise as of 9mar02 the difference is in the neighborhood of 200.00 to 300.00 on some reservations.
i have lost many customers to the internet until they are burned at the airport because of a mistake in their booking.
since i became an agent i have never felt so lost as i do now. i have no idea where to turn next. i love being of service to the public but that is almost unheard of anymore. even our telephones are on automatic pilot, i have not spoken with a live person immediately for so long i don't know what to say if they answer too quickly.
all of the tour companies are going out of business after 20years and so are travel agencies. someone has forgotten that we are in need of food and clothing also. the airlines get help from the government and get bailed out after they loose business, what about the small agencies that keep their planes flying and full. we lost 65,000 worth of business in three months. who helps us? 
as always the rich get rich and the poor get more confused, wondering why or better yet why not!
our senior comunity really suffers because we all know that they do not understand our modern way of doing things. most of them do not have access to the internet, and after 70years doing everything manually, how do we train them to understand? 
they need some consideration here also. they don't get the low fares or the fare breaks unless someone helps them like the travel agent.
my point is don't they deserve the same treatment? some of them have 
earned so little in their lifetime and now they are expected to pay the higher rate. 
if the dot does not do something, we all go down. the internet included. the airline can do anything it wants to whomever it wants with the support of our federal government.
when 9/11/01 happened we all joined together to form a more united america. now that it is a an unpleasant memory, we must pickup the pieces dust the dirt from the terrorist off and go on. it is harder for some of us to recover economically than it is for others who have the support and funds from our federal government.
travel agents need help please listen.
thank you for your time

Small and medium sized travel agencies need your help.  We are in danger of being monopolized by huge airlines that want to take the human element out of booking an airline ticket.  With the travel agent consumer watchdogs out of the way, airlines will certainly take advantage of consumers.  Please require that any fares offered by airlines be offered in all methods, CRS, phone and Internet.  And, we need your help in regulating the airlines to require that agent fees be collected on the airline ticket.

eleminated commission payment to all US travel agencies-the wording in
their faxes is practically identical...collusion at its finest, Their decison will destroy an entire small business industry and throw thousands of travel agents out of work, and the traveling public will
have to fend for themselves.  Unfortunaltely most of our clients do not have a computer or a credit card and will have a great deal of trouble getting their airline tickets.  The internet will be of no help to them.  Those of our clients who have booked on the internet
return to us. WHAT DID THE AIRLINES DO WITH THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS??
The Bush Administration gave them Piles of money..They spent it on
what? upgrading ORBITZ?? I just signed a CRS contract with Worldspan
owned by Northwest-Delta and American...do they expect me to honor that contract when they no longer consider travel agents partners??
I would rather go bankrupt. Why dont the CEOs take a cut in pay?
Where is the US Government? Are they not interested in the tax revenue
or would they rather see the unemployment lines grow longer? 
The travel agency system is the most efficient and cost effective form
of airline ticket sales.  They dont have to pay for rent, insurance, payroll taxes, computers, office expenses, phones faxes.....they just pay a pittance AFTER the sale is made and the customer is handled.
The airline paycut to 0 has destroyed an entire industry.  Someone in
Washington should be paying attention.

This type of marketing not only keeps agents from selling these reduced airfares, but it also discriminates against citizens without access to a computers.  No one industry should be allowed to bully any all competition out of the mix, the way the airlines have for the past 10 years.  SHAME OUR COUNTRY AND OUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES!

If the rates charged per segment remain, then GDS should share this bonanza with producer. Also GDS are providing very little service, incluiding no toll free access and long waits to reach help desks.

Share profits with producers

Through numerous phone calls, endless searching on the web, and finally contacting the IC&RC and NAACAP via e-mail, we would like to encourage that the definition of an SAP be expanded to include state-licensed or certified professional counselors.  Trying to find a list of even three SAPs within the tri-city area should not take 7 days or longer.  The NAACAP responded to our e-mail with an internet address that sent us to a website that has not been updated since 11/20/2001, containing only one SAP name for the entire state of Michigan.  The other organization is getting back with us this week with some names of SAPs throughout Michigan.  
After calling multiple treatment centers throughout the state of Michigan, we have come to realize not many of them are familiar with this necessary certification, it seems to confuse them.  They either need to be informed of this certification, in detail, so they can help this industry, or the guidelines need to be widened.  Throught the attempt to explain to them what the Department of Transportation is, that there is an employee that failed a drug and/or alcohol screen, and they can only see Certified Substance Abuse Professionals should not confuse these centers, they should already know all about it, and more so than someone in our position.

I am an Alaska Airlines employee and am writing to express support for the companys application for two ""beyond-perimeter"" slots between Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA) and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

None of the current beyond-perimeter slot allocations are being used to serve California and approving our application would provide this badly needed convenient service. Approving our application would also provide ""domestic network benefits"" throughout the West Coast because together with our codeshare partners, we serve 43 domestic and international communities beyond Los Angeles.

Approving this application would also clearly ""increase competition by new entrant air carriers."" Although Alaska Airlines is a major presence on the West Coast, it currently has only two slots at DCAthe round-trip flight to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) authorized by the Departments slot award last year.

Alaskas DCA-SEA service has been a big success and has resulted in more competitive fares between Seattle and all Washington-area airports. It has led to the initiation of our new service to other East Coast airports---Boston, Newark, Washington Dulles and Miami.

Most importantly from my perspective as an employee, allowing Alaska Airlines to fly to Washingtons Reagan National airport from LAX will best serve the public interest because of the award-winning customer service we will provide. We live our values of Alaska spirit, resourcefulness, integrity, professionalism and caring every day as we serve the traveling public.

Please allow us the opportunity to offer our unique customer service to travelers between LAX and DCA by granting Alaska Airlines the two available slots at Reagan National Airport. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Kelly Kochanek

None of the current beyond-perimeter slot allocations are being used to serve California and approving our application would provide this badly needed convenient service. Approving our application would also provide ""domestic network benefits"" throughout the West Coast because together with our codeshare partners, we serve 43 domestic and international communities beyond Los Angeles.

Approving this application would also clearly ""increase competition by new entrant air carriers."" Although Alaska Airlines is a major presence on the West Coast, it currently has only two slots at DCAthe round-trip flight to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) authorized by the Departments slot award last year.

Alaskas DCA-SEA service has been a big success and has resulted in more competitive fares between Seattle and all Washington-area airports. It has led to the initiation of our new service to other East Coast airports---Boston, Newark, Washington Dulles and Miami.

Most importantly from my perspective as an employee, allowing Alaska Airlines to fly to Washingtons Reagan National airport from LAX will best serve the public interest because of the award-winning customer service we will provide. We live our values of Alaska spirit, resourcefulness, integrity, professionalism and caring every day as we serve the traveling public.

Please allow us the opportunity to offer our unique customer service to travelers between LAX and DCA by granting Alaska Airlines the two available slots at Reagan National Airport. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Julie Kochanek

Respectfully submitted to the DOT:

I feel I must respond to this Central Time/Mountain Time issue once again.  

The arguments of ""don't shove it down our throats,"" ""our children won't survive,"" ""it will ruin business in Mercer County"" just don't hold water.  My three children have been living on Central Time their whole lives (they are 16, 13, and 10 years old) and are surviving quite fine!  

We live at Pick City and they go to school in Hazen; so, we are constantly doing the conversion, or asking ""my time or your time,"" ""Central Time or Mountain Time.""  Yes, for a few short weeks in the winter we have shorter days which means on Central Time, children would go to school as the sun is coming up.  But conversely, on Mountain Time, they would be coming home from school as teh sun is going down!  I would rather that they be heading for school when the sun will soon be rising (school operating on Central Time) than coming home from school as the sun goes down and continues to get darker until the next day (school operating on Mountain Time).  And, really, this is for such a short time in the winter, I don't feel it is a major concern.

As for ""ruining businesses by changing to Central Time, I believe Central Time would only benefit business.  In this day and age with technology etc., you need to do business with Bismarck, Minot, Fargo, maybe even Minneapolis.  They are all on Central Time.  You may try to contact one of these other business in the Central Time zone only to find out that they're on their lunch break (oops it's that darn time change again) or they're gone for the day (there goes that time change again).  It has to be very frustrating for businesses to constantly deal with this day in and day out.  Television and radio stations for this area are on Central Time (yes, Beulah does have a radio station - but that is ONE station versus the multiple ones from Bismarck and Minot that serve this area).  

We are a family of five.  My husband works in Beulah for one of the energy companies.  There are many power plants/energy companies in Mercer County.  They employ hundreds of people and the majority of these companies, if not all, operate on Central Time.  We are moving to Hazen in September.  The schools operate on Mountain Time; so, the kids and I will switch to Mountain Time.  My husband, who works at one of Mercer County's energy companies, will go to work on Central Time, which is the time most, if not all, of these companies operate on.  I hate to be blunt but, ""it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this out!""  This is simply ridiculous!  Which clocks in my house shall I set to Central Time?  Which clocks shall I set to Mountain Time?  

Please, stop our confusion and let us all be on one time.  The only logical one is Central Time.  And yes, there was a vote, and the majority of that vote was for a change to Central Time!  Please, abide by this majority's decision of wanting to change to Central Time.  It just, simply, makes sense!!

Looking back at a November 30, 2000 copy of the Hazen Star, December 31, 2000 was set as a deadline to file comments.  Not making a decision is the same as a ""No"" decision.  There will never be complete agreement in the county as to the time change.     Just a fact of life.

If you do decide to go ahead as the majority of residents voted and approve the time change:


We would be able to watch television and the programs would be on the same time as
indicated on the channel guide.  We wouldn't always have to be thinking...it says 7 pm now that really means 8 pm.

We would be able to go to a movie in Hazen and know that if it starts at 7 pm, that really doesn't mean 8 pm.

We would be able to make a doctor appointment and not have to say, (as we always do), that's my time, not your time.  Right?

School kids in our community going to two different schools, would be going at the same times..not an hour apart as they are now.

Please give us a decision on the time change.   Even if you require another vote of Mercer County residents, please make a decision.

Once the airlines are responsible for the delay, the delayed passengers should be compensated for their delay.
If a passenger is late for a flight and the passenger has a ticket with a no change clause, the passenger is then responsible for any additional compensation to reach the intended destination.  But the airline can be responsible for a delay and cause the passenger to miss a connection to another flight on another airline or the one he was flying on and the airline doesn't have any responsibility to assist the passenger.  I feel that the airlines should be held responsible for any delay that they have caused and be made to assist the passenger to reach the intended destination as soon as possible.  The penalty should be semiliar to when the airlines overbook a flight and have to assist the bumped passengers.

Attention:  Docket Clerk

Re:	Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
Reporting the Causes of Airline Delays and Cancellations
	Docket. No. OST 2000-8164


Dear Secretary Mineta:

The City of Boston Environment Department has reviewed the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for Reporting the Causes of Airline Delays and Cancellations and hereby submits the following comments.

The City of Boston agrees with the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Advisory Air Carrier On-Time Task Force (Task Force) that changes in the current on-time reporting system are necessary in order that the public have clear information about the nature and sources of airline delays and cancellations.

The DOT is proposing that 14 CFR Part 234 be amended to require that airline carriers report the causes of airline delays and cancellations and that a new reporting requirement apply only to those air carriers already reporting under Part 234.  Small air carriers, medium and large regional air carriers, other major and national carriers and code-share partners of major carriers, accounting for 17 percent of enplanements, would not report data.  The inclusion of these carriers is to be the subject of a future rulemaking.  The NPRM recognizes that the absence of information from these carriers will potentially affect the utility of available information.

 BED Comments - Reporting the Causes of Airline Delays and Cancellations NPRM
Docket. No. OST 2000-8164
Page 2


Recommended in the NPRM are four categories for reporting delays:
h air carrier;
h extreme weather;
h National Aviation System (NAS); and
h late arriving aircraft.

Unclear from the list of activities to be attributed to air carrier-related and extreme weather-related delays is the assignment of deicing activities.  If deicing is considered maintenance, it would be under the air carrier category.  If it is attributed to extreme weather, it should be listed under the extreme weather category (delays caused by weather conditions, actual or forecasted at the point of departure, en route or at point of arrival that, in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and/or in the judgment of the air carrier, prevents operation of that flight and/or prevents operations of subsequent flights due to the intended aircraft being out of position as a result of a prior delay attributable to weather).

Bird strikes, coded as air carrier-related during a pilot program, may be more appropriately assigned to individual airports.  It appears that there is no such category unless airport-specific delays are assigned to the NAS category.

Given the significant and difficult changes in airport/airline security since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, we suggest that a separate security-related category may be helpful.  While we understand that the NAS category encompasses a number of operational eventualities, separating security-related delays from other operational events might aid the Department of Transportation (DOT) in determining the efficiency of new security procedures.

In discussing the NAS, the NPRM states that, ¡§Consistent high volume delays are an indication to airport operators and to state and local governments that there is a need for infrastructure investments and improvements.¡¨  We note that such investments and improvements need not occur at airports where there are high volume delays.  Consistent delays can signal an unbalanced regional air transportation system as suggested by the DOT/Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Notice of Market-based Actions to Relieve Airport Congestion and Delay (Docket No. OST-2001-9849) through which the DOT sought ¡§¡Kinformation on the possible role, feasibility, and effectiveness of using market-based approaches to relieve airline flight delays and congestion at busy airports.¡¨   These approaches include peak period pricing, the auctioning of landing and takeoff rights and offering financial incentives and/or infrastructure investment to increase the use of 
BED Comments - Reporting the Causes of Airline Delays and Cancellations NPRM

secondary airports.  The City of Boston believes that the subject NPRM must be informed by the comments on OST-2001-9849 and policy around market-based actions to relieve congestion informed by the subject NPRM.

Without delay information from the 17 percent of carriers not required to report under this NPRM, it will be impossible for the DOT to implement well-informed market-based approaches to minimize delays.  In addition, some air carriers track the initial cause of a delay for ¡§late arriving aircraft¡¨ and some do not.  Yet, the NPRM does not propose a standardized reporting system that would allow for the tracking of downline effects of earlier delays.  Giving carriers flexibility in this matter, consistent with the DOT¡¦s goal to ¡§require minimal change to the air carriers¡¦ internal tracking systems¡K¡¨ hampers the collection of accurate data and makes delay assignment factually inadequate.  While we are sympathetic to the financial constraints of air carriers, delay reporting is not credible to the public and not useful to policy-makers when consistent data is not collected from all carriers.  The City of Boston suggests that mandated, standardized reporting required of all carriers operating in the U.S. is necessary in order to gather precise and truly useful data.

Thank you for the opportunity to offer comment.


Sincerely,



Antonia M. Pollak

Re:	Docket Number OST-01-10380; Hazardous Materials: Knowledge Requirement of Civil Penalty Enforcement Proceedings (66 Fed. Reg. 42909)

Dear Sir or Madam:

On behalf of the Institute of Makers of Explosives (IME), I am submitting comments on the issues covered by the above-captioned notice.  

The IME is the safety association of the commercial explosives industry.  Our mission is to promote safety and the protection of employees, users, the public and the environment; and to encourage the adoption of uniform rules and regulations in the manufacture, transportation, storage, handling, use and disposal of explosive materials used in blasting and other essential operations.  IME member companies produce over 95 percent of the commercial explosives consumed in the United States.  IME member companies regularly engage in transporting hazardous materials and/or arranging for the transportation of such materials.  Accordingly, the issues covered by this proceeding have significant interest to IME.

IME supports the request submitted by Federal Express Corporation (Federal Express) that the Department of Transportation (DOT) develop further guidance regarding what constitutes constructive knowledge under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (Pub. L. 93-633, §110, 88 Stat. 2160 (Jan. 3, 1975).  Specifically, Federal Express has requested DOT to provide additional guidance providing essential criteria defining constructive knowledge of undeclared hazardous materials, that would allow the carriers to design and implement a viable system for training their employees and for identifying and reporting discrepancies .  66 Fed. Reg. 42910.

1120 Nineteenth Street, N.W., Suite 310, Washington, D.C.  20036-3605  Tel:  (202) 429-9280
 

The Federal Register notice describing the Federal Express proposal notes that the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) considers a carrier to have knowingly violated the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) when the carrier accepts or transports a hazardous material with actual or constructive knowledge that a package contains a hazardous material which has not been packaged, marked, labeled, and described on a shipping paper as required by the HMR.  Id. at 42910.  The legal standard remains that knowledge that a reasonable person acting in the circumstances and exercising reasonable care would have.  Id.   IME agrees with Federal Express that guidance providing greater specificity regarding what constitutes reasonable care and constructive knowledge will assist carriers in understanding their obligations under the law and in complying with the HMR.

As DOT is undoubtedly well aware, the question of whether the circumstances of a particular case are sufficient to give rise to an obligation of further inquiry often is fraught with appreciable difficulty  both for the carrier and DOT.  To the extent that DOT is able to outline a set of facts that will, in ordinary circumstances, be expected to trigger further inquiry on the part of a carrier, both the carrier and the DOT inspector will be better able to determine whether the actions of the carrier are/were appropriate to a given situation.

Likewise, IME agrees with Federal Express that providing guidance as to what types of documentation will not be reviewed, and, therefore, will not give rise to a claim of constructive knowledge, also will benefit carriers and DOT inspectors.  Because constructive knowledge is imputed only to those facts that are reasonably and naturally connected to a known fact and to which the known fact furnishes a clue, it is critical to understand that certain types of documentation will not be considered in determining what facts are known to a carrier and whether those facts should have spurred further investigation.  

Specifically, if a carrier has no legal or other obligation to review MSDS sheets, commercial invoices, packing sheets, etc. accompanying a shipment, it would be unreasonable to hold it responsible for gleaning facts or clues in those documents regarding the nature or content of a particular shipment.  Including a list of such documents in a guidance document would provide much needed clarification to carriers and DOT officials regarding the scope of the carriers obligation to inspect and investigate shipments placed in their hands.  No duty [to inquire] can exist without knowledge of the facts  upon which such duty rests.  58 Am Jur 2d §9.  

Similarly, carriers should not be imputed with constructive knowledge in cases where only broad, generic and ambiguous terms such as paint, chemical, this-end-up, fragile, caution, cold, UN, DOT, IMO, ICAO, or IATA, without further indicia of hazard, are used by the offeror of the shipment.  See, Federal Express Comments, February 28, 2002, page 3.

While IME supports the development of a guidance document, we also acknowledge that it is impossible  to lay down a general rule by which to determine what facts are sufficient to excite inquiry.  58 Am Jur 2d §11.  It seems clear, however, that Federal Express is not requesting DOT to prepare an exhaustive list of what information will or will not confer constructive knowledge in every circumstance.  Rather, the carrier industry is requesting DOTs continued assistance in helping the industry to better appreciate the types of information that DOT considers telling and/or suspect and, so, to help the industry devise more targeted and effective training programs to identify potential undeclared shipments of hazardous goods.  In this regard, IME is wholly supportive of the request made by Federal Express.

Your consideration of these comments is appreciated.

Sincerely,

sig

Re:	Docket No. OST-01-10380: Knowledge required for Civil Penalty Enforcement Proceedings


Dear Sir or Madam:

	E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) is a global science and technology company engaged in the manufacture, sale and distribution of chemicals, crop protection products, paints, textiles, resins, plastics and related materials.  Many of the products produced by DuPont or purchased by it are regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and fall within the definition of hazardous materials as that term is defined in the hazardous materials regulations (HMR) found in the United Stated Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  DuPont is grateful for the opportunity to share its experience and comment on the Notice and Invitation to Comment referenced above.

	DuPont is vitally interested in ensuring that its products and those it purchases are transported safely and in full compliance with all applicable law.  To accomplish this task DuPont maintains a hazardous material consultants group in its core and, over 25 years ago, established its RHYTHM (Remember How You Treat Hazardous Materials) network of knowledgeable and trained hazmat employees within its strategic business units and at all manufacturing and warehouse locations.  Annual meetings and periodic in-house training sessions are conducted for its hazmat employees.  In addition, employees are encouraged to attend outside hazmat training courses affecting areas or products within the scope of their employment.  DuPont also actively shares information concerning United States and international regulatory requirements and safe transportation practices with customers and suppliers throughout DuPonts global supply chain.

	Despite all the attention and resources dedicated to the training of its employees and others throughout its corporate supply chain, DuPont will, from time to time, receive shipments of raw materials, samples or returns which are not properly documented, marked, labeled, placarded or packaged in accordance with applicable hazardous materials regulations.  Investigation of these incidents has indicated that, as a rule, these incidents result either from negligence on the part of one or more employees or lack of knowledge on the part of the shipper or its employees.  The later case is more prevalent with overseas shipments than with those that originating within the United States.  Many of these incidents are brought to DuPonts attention by its able carrier partners.


	DuPont is also aware that, from time to time, unscrupulous shippers will purposefully tender undeclared hazardous materials to unsuspecting carriers for transport.  Whether this is done to avoid the added costs of compliance with the HMR, to avoid higher freight cost or for some other inappropriate reason, this practice is wrong and should be stopped.  Shippers, in cases involving willful and purposeful violation of the HMR, should be prosecuted  both civilly and criminally - and punished.  Cases involving conscience and willful misconduct, however, should be separated from instances where ,due to simple negligence or lack of knowledge, the HMR are violated.  DuPont will in the balance of its statement confine its comments to situations involving simple negligence or lack of sophistication on the part of shippers engaged in the distribution of hazardous materials.

Carriers, regardless of mode, are the last line of defense in protecting the public from the undeclared or improperly prepared shipments of hazardous materials.  Each carrier, therefore, should, and in DuPonts judgement has a legal obligation, not to accept for transport any regulated materials that are not properly marked, labeled, placarded, packaged or documented in accordance with applicable regulations..  

	As indicated in comments by the American Trucking Association in this proceeding, the HMR currently provides that the DOT may assess a civil penalty against a person that knowingly violates the law.  It further states that: 

		A person acts knowingly when  

(A) The person has actual knowledge of the facts giving rise to the violation; or
(B) A reasonable person acting in the circumstances and exercising reasonable care would have that knowledge. 

In 1998 The Research and Special Programs Administrations (RSPA) Chief Counsel offered the following guidance for use in interpreting this section of the HMR:

 (A) Carrier may not ignore readily apparent facts that indicate that either (1) a shipment declared to contain a hazardous material is not properly packaged, marked, labeled, placarded or described on a shipping paper, or (2) a shipment actually contains a hazardous material governed by the HMR despite the fact that it is not marked, labeled placarded or described on a shipping paper as containing a hazardous material .

In the case of an undeclared or hidden shipment, all relevant facts must be considered to determine whether or not a reasonable person acting in the circumstances and exercising reasonable care would realize the presence of hazardous materials . 

A carriers  employees who accept packages for transportation must be trained to recognize a suspicious package as part of their function-specific training as specified in 49 CFR 172.704(a)(2), because the legal standard remains the knowledge of a reasonable person acting in the circumstances and exercising reasonable care would have. 

	Based upon this interpretation and advice, carriers must exercise reasonable care in their acceptance of packages or other freight.  If freight offered for transport manifests an inconstancy in its offering, the carrier should question the shipper and resolve the discrepancy before accepting the freight for transport.  Inconsistencies might include the presence of hazardous materials labels or placards but the absence of appropriate shipping papers or the inclusion of a hazardous materials description on a shipping paper accompanying materials lacking labels or placards.  Similarly, if words, such as those set out on page two of comments submitted on behalf of Federal Express on February 28, 2002 are contained within the text of the shipping papers or other documents generally reviewed by the carrier in the normal course of accepting freight for transport, the carrier should not accept the material for transport.  If, under these circumstances, undeclared hazardous materials are accepted by the carrier for transport, the carrier should be liable for a fine for not acting as a reasonable carrier would (or should) act under the circumstances.

	Prudence would also indicate that a carrier exercising reasonable care, which has repeatedly been offered hazardous materials from a given shipper, should hesitate to accept packages from that same shipper which possess the same characteristics as those it has historically received but are not marked, labeled or otherwise documented as containing hazardous materials.  Prudence and public interest would indicate that the carrier, in such circumstance, should ask the shipper if it has made an error or if this is a different product from those it has historically been tendered.  Failure to do so would constitute a failure to act with reasonable care and should subject the carrier to a civil fine or other appropriate punishment.

	Prudence would also dictate that the carrier should have a notice process for use when dealing with new and/or unsophisticated shippers to ensure that they are aware of and can adequately fulfill their obligations under the HMR.  Simple inquiries of these shippers made prior to their initial shipments about the contents and preparation of the packages should be made.  Such inquires could parallel the questions raised by check in clerks for passenger at the airports.  Such inquiries should continue to be made until the carrier is comfortable that the shipper has sufficient knowledge to properly fulfill its obligations under the HMR.  This practice would parallel a similar obligation imposed upon importers of hazardous materials (dangerous goods) to ensure that their overseas suppliers are aware of all applicable hazardous materials (dangerous goods) regulations.

In addition, signs, similar in nature to those posted in passenger airports, should be posted in receiving areas for LTL, package and other carriers who receive small shipments at a central location away from the shippers principal place of business or  residence..  Written notices informing new or sporadic shippers of the existence and nature of the HMR, perhaps including the definitions of the hazard classes, should also be provided by carriers.

	Carriers, as the publics last defense, should, and DuPont believes do, have an obligation to make a reasonable, affirmative effort to protect the public from improper or unauthorized shipment of hazardous materials which can result in spills and other incidents.  This effort should be in addition to the obligations of shippers to properly prepare, package, label, placard and document hazardous materials shipments.  Failure to exercise reasonable care to protect the public in such cases should result in fines or other penalties.  The duty to act with reasonable care should apply equally to all  including shippers and carriers - of those involved in the distribution of hazardous materials.

	The DOT should assist this effort by helping to better define minimum obligations which carriers, shippers and others engaged in the distribution of hazardous materials, owe the public and which would be imposed upon them under RSPAs definition of constructive knowledge.  The practices which DuPont has suggested above as well as those referenced by Federal Express, if codified and included in appropriate rulemakings or other guidelines, would help define what these minimum obligations are and further enhance the safe transportation of hazardous materials which shippers, carriers and the DOT owe to the public.

As a owner operator of a small Part 135 Air Carrier I was very 
frustrated with the previous apllication process in seeking compensation. Like many small Air Carriers we have one bookeeper.
I was unable to complete the application criteria using an ASM
formula to determine losses. I discussed the application with
accountants and gave up. The fact is our aircraft were parked in the 
hangar and did not fly. I would very much appreciate a set-aside
exist, allowing small Air Carriers a chance to stay in business.

Set-Aside Funds Access?
All Part 135 operators small and big should have access.

How Should Funds Be Distributed?
The program needs to be simple. In our case as an Air Carrier
operating on demand Air Ambulance services 24/7. If the fleet
flew X hours per month prior to 9/11 and it flew X after.
What were the losses? In our case I tried to look at the lost revenue hours. Each Air Ambulance flight that we take has a base rate or 
some might call a lift-off fee plus a mile or hourly fee for the aircraft. So when our aircraft sat in the hangar we still paid the 
employees, banks, insurance, everthing a small business does to 
keep the lights on.

I do not have the answer or methodology to faily determine losses.

I cannot hire a herd of accountants to prove to the DOT what our losses were.

I can only use historical data, hours on the aircaft.

Whatever is decided ""keep it simple"" so we have an opportunity.

Re: Procedures for Compensation of Air Carriers


Dear Sir or Madam:

HealthNet Aeromedical Services is an air ambulance provider based in in West Virginia.  We operate 3 medically configured helicopters and a King Air E90 Turbo-prop airplane.  We provide emergency air ambulance transport services to ill and injured citizens of our state.

We experienced direct and indirect financial losses as a result of the tragic events of September 11, 2001.  We are pleased to learn that Congress and the DOT have recognized that the efforts to implement the initial relief efforts were targeted at commercial airlines, and did not adequately provide a mechanism for relief for air ambulances.

HealthNet supports the proposal from the Association of Air Medical Services (AAMS) to base the relief on the number of missed transports, determined by comparing the number patients transported during the 30 days prior to September 11th, with the 30 days following September 11th.  

Preliminarily, we have estimated that we experienced a decrease of approximately 17 patient transports during this time for one base of operation that had strict FAA imposed flight restrictions on our aircraft.  HealthNet estimates that these restrictions on our flight capabilities adversely effected our flight volume and corresponded to a loss in revenue.

HealthNet also support the proposal from AAMS that the relief be based on the proposed new Medicare Fee Schedule rates.  While these rates are far below our charges, and less than we would have expected to collect on the missed transports, we understand that it is a reasonable standard to
be used nationally.  Our average one-way (loaded) transport distance is 50 statute miles for helicopter, and 175 statute miles for fixed-wing transports.


We look forward to making a formal application for relief when the process has been formalized.

Docket Clerk,

Dear sir or madam,

University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics operates a two-helicopter air ambulance program based in Madison, Wisconsin.

We experienced a fairly dramatic decline in requests for transports after September 11, 2001.  I am pleased that Congress and the DOT is considering including compensation for air ambulance providers within the air carrier relief program.

We support the proposal from the Association of Air Medical Services (AAMS) to base the relief on the number of missed transports, based on a 30 day comparison, pre and post September 11th.  During the formal application process, we will be able to provide you with auditable records demonstrating the drop in requests and transports.

A preliminary review reveals a decrease of 18 transports and 43 requests during this time period.

We support the proposal from AAMS that the relief be based on the proposed new Medicare Fee Schule.  Though these rates are significantly below our charges and expected collections, we understand that it is a reasonable standard.

Our average one-way loaded transport distance is 40 miles.

We look forward to making a formal application for relief when the process has been formalized.

Respectfully,

M. Bruce Lindsay, MD, FACEP
Medical Director
UW Med Flight

We operate an air ambulance company based in Lawrenceville, GA. We operate fixed wing air ambulances.

We did experience direct and indirect financial losses as a result of the terrorrist attacks of September 11, 2001. I am very pleased to learn that Congress and the DOT have recognized that the efforts to implement the initial relief efforts were targeted at commercial airlines, and did not adequately provide a mechanism for relief for companies like ours.

I support the proposal from the Association of Air Medical Services to base the relief on the number of missed transports, determined by comparing the number of patient transports the one hundred and eleven (111) days prior to September 11th, with the one hundred and eleven (111) days following September 11th. We utilize the one hundred eleven days (111) days time frame to show a direct correlation from September 11th until December 31st, and the same number of days prior to September 11th. This is the time frame that we have felt directly and indirectly the effects from September 11th. During the formal application process, we will be able to provide you with accurate and auditable records demonstrating the change in the number of transports for the time period specified. Preliminarily, we have estimated that we expereinced  decrease of approximately 42 transports during this time frame.

We also support the proposal from AAMS that the relief be based on the proposed new Medicare Fee Schedule rates. While these rates are far below our charges, and less than we would have expected to collect on the missed transport, we understand that this is a reasonable standard to be used nationally.

Our average one-way trip (loaded) transport distance is 850 statute miles.

We look forward to making a formal application for relief when the process has been formalized.

Re: Procedures for Compensation of Air Carriers

Dear Sir or Madam:
Hartford Hospital operates an air ambulance service based in Hartford, Connecticut consisting of two helicopters servicing the state and surrounding regions.
Our air ambulance service experienced financial losses because of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  We are pleased to learn that Congress and the DOT have recognized that the initial efforts to implement the air carrier relief  were targeted at the commercial airlines, and did not adequately provide a mechanism for relief for air ambulance.
We support the proposal from the Association of Air Medical Services (AAMS) to base the relief on the number of missed transports, determined by comparing the number of patients transported during the 30 days prior to September 11th, with the 30 days following September 11th.  During the formal application process, we will provide you with accurate and auditable records demonstrating the change in the number of transports for the period specified.  Preliminarily, we have estimated that we experienced a decrease of approximately 5 transports during this time.
We also support the proposal from AAMS that the relief be based on the proposed new Medicare Fee Schedule rate.  While these rates are far below our charges, and less than we would have expected to collect on the missed transports, we understand that it is a reasonable standard to be used nationally.
Our average one-way transport distance is 24 statute miles for helicopter transports.
We look forward to making a formal application for relief when the process has been formalized.
Sincerely,


Sherry A.

Rooney",,,false,DOT-OST-2001-10885-0001,,,2002-01-18T05:00Z,2002-01-17T05:00Z,,,,,,,,"Comment(s)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Our company while operating as an air taxi under Part 135 is primarily an air tour operator.  We are supportive of the Department using its discretion to provide a set-aside for air ambulances, air tour operators and others for whom the ASM-based formula inadequately reflects their share of direct and incremental losses incurred in the post 9/11 period.

Many air tour operations were heavily injured in the post 9/11 period because in addition to their revenues being derived from discretionary expenditures by customers they are located in areas dependent on air carrier travel for the customer to get to the locality in the first place such as Hawaii.  This is in effect a double whammy.  Furthermore, costs per ASM are generally much higher due to the smaller aircraft utilized in air tour operations.  My calculations indicate that we may receive compensation from the Department under the current program equal to only about 15 percent of our projected losses as submitted.  I doubt that many, if any, of the scheduled carriers are receiving anywhere near that small a percentage of their losses.

The Department in its Federal Register Request for Comments stated that they had little information about the situation of air carriers other than air ambulances to which a set-aside could apply.  On the contrary, they already have significant data about them from the ""second increment"" submissions seeking compensation.  All that may be missing is identifying which carriers fall into particular groups.  That should be easily solved with an identification request to air taxi ""second increment"" submitters.

Much emphasis has been placed on compensating under the ASM approach regularly reported upon by the scheduled carriers to the Department.  However, the Department has required all claiming carriers whether scheduled, cargo or air taxi to also report ""common"" data detailing losses and projected losses for the same applicable periods.  From that data, the Department should already know the projected losses of all submitting carriers and can compute the expected average percentage compensation payout on projected losses.

Seems to me that the Department simply needs only to identify the air tour and air ambulance carriers, and then analyze the data already submitted in  order to determine the magnitude to which these carriers were more injured than the average.  The goal of this whole program should be to provide some equality, though certainly not perfect, in loss percentage coverage among all the submitting carriers.  A set-aside should be carved out of the 4.5 billion to satisfy that objective.  Its size should be determinable by the foregoing method of analysis of existing data after identifying the appropriate members of the group.

In September,2001 we did not fly any flights due to the ATC shut down. We only recieved $1,492 as compensation as part of the bail out. This is less than 10%. Shouldn't the distribution by a little more? I noted that at most carriers would recieve 85% of their losses. Something is not right.

If you take the top 25 carriers distributions, 93.8 percent of all the dollars distributed to date are covered.

It is reasonable to assume the resources of the carriers in the lower portion of the current AUP requirement, based on RTM and ASM, have nowhere near the resources of the carriers that have received tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.

In summary, the criteria for determining the requirement to perform full AUP versus simplified procedures should be modified.  The determination should be based on the materiality of the requested loss reimbursement and not the ASMs or RTM.  Additionally, the AUP requirement should take the relative size of the requested loss reimbursement into consideration.

Regarding:  Criteria and Materiality for Performing Agreed Upon Procedures and Simplified Procedures

The criteria for determining which carriers need apply full Agreed Upon Procedures, (AUPs) and those that apply simplified procedures should not be based on ASMs or RTMs but rather the materiality of the loss reimbursement requested.  The current methodology could require a carrier that has a certain level of ASMs or RTMs perform full AUPs when the carriers actual loss reimbursement is relatively small.

In the commentary with the rule, DOT estimates that it will take the air carriers and their accountants an average of 386 manhours to comply with the rule.  It is unreasonable to request this information 30 days from the final rule.  Additionally, there is no compelling reason for this timing as most of the funds have been paid out previously in rounds one and two.

RE: Procedures for Compensation of Air Carriers

Dear Secretary Mineta,

I am the Edward R. Eroe of the Duke Life Flight, a hospital-based helicopter service that serves Central North Carolina, Southern Virginia, and Northern South Carolina.  Duke operates two helicopters with over 1,200 transports for cardiac, trauma, neo-natal, and other critical patients. 

The federal closing of our nations airspace as a result of the attacks of September 11th, 2001, created financial hardship for my air ambulance operations. This was due to not being able to fly for nearly two days and then seeing a decrease in requests from referring hospitals thinking that we could not fly due to the terrorist attacks.  I am writing to request that the Department of Transportation provide reimbursement for our operation so it can continue serving the critically ill and injured individuals in our community.  

Unfortunately, the DOTs  Procedures for Compensation of Air Carriers notice published in the Federal Register on April 17, 2002, does not provide an effective mechanism for us to apply for this sorely needed relief.  In fact, we believe that this notice does not meet the intent of Congress amendment to the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (Public Law 107-71), which recognized that air ambulances are a unique and essential type of air carrier that cannot be treated in the same manner as other air carriers. This amendment clearly stated that some relief monies could be set-aside for air ambulances and other air carriers for whom application of a distribution formula containing available seat miles as a factor would inadequately reflect their share of direct and incremental costs.  Yet, the DOT notice again mistakenly ties air ambulance reimbursement to an Average Seat Mile (ASM) formula which Congress has acknowledged is inadequate for gauging air ambulance revenue losses. (ASMs are not, and never have been reported to the Department by air ambulance operations.)  In fact, your notice seems to condition air ambulance reimbursement on the reporting of ASMs, leading our organization to question whether air ambulances are even eligible to apply for relief under this notice.
 
Even if we were eligible to apply, application of ASMs to air ambulance operations as per the DOT notice will reimburse air ambulances at a rate of less than 1% of its average revenues per patient transport.  How can this be fair when the Part 121 carriers have been earmarked to receive 65% or more of their lost revenues?

We ask that the Department reconsider its procedures for compensation of air ambulances. We understand that the Association of Air Medical Services offered a reasonable mechanism for providing relief through the use of the average patient transport costs under the Medicare fee schedule. This Medicare per trip rate represents 63% of normal single-transport or per-trip revenues.

The civilian air medical industry provides over ninety percent of the medical airlift capacity in this country, and plays a critical role in responding to all kinds of emergencies. Appropriate compensation to help maintain our nations emergency response infrastructure is of paramount importance, now more than ever. 

Sincerely,



Edward R. Eroe, M.H.S.A., CHE, CAE, CMTE

This consistency benefits both the consumer and the businesses.  This consistency allows the consumer to confidently compare prices and make purchasing decisions.  Without consistency, consumer confidence drops and consumers get justifiably angry.  This consistency also provides a level playing field on which the businesses may compete.  The order, exempting Orbitz from disclosing their fees/pricing in the same manner the government requires other travel vendors to list their fees, is absolutely anti-consumer and anti-competitive.  Consumers cannot readily compare appples to apples.  Two classes of businesses are created by this ruling.

Primarily, if there is a drop in traffic and more so, if there is not, the government needs to assign a maximum number of planes that can take off from a given airport at a given time (This would also extend to a maximum number of planes in the air). As for proposals for paying more to take off at peak times, while this may be better than the current chaos, those who can pay more for such a privilege should be told to go elsewhere, as we cannot ""sell"" safety. That said, I think we should write in exemptions to antitrust laws to allow airlines to collude in order to coordinate schedules into major hubs and some trading off could occur. Also, given 9/11, we must retire older planes from the fleet, as that remains a major problem in TWA 800. Airlines should also be encouraged to stockplie fuel at times of high supply so that this is not an excuse for higher fares when shortages come. In short, the FAA badly needs to hear from the traveling public and a citizen board, not an industry or labor board, would be a good start toward a brighter future. Thanks.


Cut numbers of flights from airports, including at peak times, to enhance safety -amend antitrust laws to allow limited collusion of airlines to achieve coordinated schedules -cut numbers of flights in the air to achieve safe distances -cut older planes from the fleet to enhance safety and prevent TWA 800 -increase stockpiles of jet fuel to promote lower fares at time of shortage -establish traveler citizen advisory board to advise Secretary and airlines.",,,,,,,"postmarkDate, Answer Date, Date the document was postmarked"

If allowed to fairly compete, the fair market system will force the airlines to reach the objective of this potential regulation, which is to distribute traffic more evenly. Airline customers will pay more to go thier preffered airport or travel at thier preferred time - and the government needs to do nothing to make this happen.

In the Chicago area, and other parts of the Midwest (including St Louis), there are many smaller airports that are under-utilized while airports like Chicago O'Hare or St Louis Lambert just get more and more crowded and congested.  Chicago Midway Airport is already at capacity.  This leads to flight delays.  

Perhaps, concerning Chicago, it is time to look at other airports in the region.  This includes Rockford (Illinois), and Gary (Indiana).  Both of these airports are underutilized and have a lot of room to expand should it be necessary.

For St Louis, there is Mid-America Airport on the Illinois side, that is currently and expensive, under-utilized boondoggle right now.  St Louis Lambert Airport is already at capacity.  

How can the airlines and regulators encourage better utilization of existing airports?  Here are my suggestions:

1) At peak times raise the fees charged for flights into places like Chicago O'Hare or St Louis Lambert.

2)  Through a mandate of some sort, cap the number of flights that can land in a specified length of time at places like O'Hare or Lambert.

3) Encourage airlines to start offering comparable flights to other regional airports in the same vicinity in order to keep the same number of flights, if not increase, to a particular metropolitan area.  

4)  Figure out ways make flights originating or arriving at say Chicago-Gary Airport, instead of Chicago O'Hare competitive in regard to service and cost.  This can be done, as supposedly under-utilized airports like Chicago-Gary, Rockford (Illinois), and perhaps even St Louis Mid-America, have lower operation costs, landing fees, and security costs associated with their use.  

I am also sure that various types of tax holidays can be implemented for places like Chicago-Gary, or Rockford (Illinois), as many of these under-utilized airports are in economically depressed areas and would benefit from such an expansion when it comes to jobs and economy.  Hopefully, these types of tax holidays will reflect also in the prices for air-tickets from these airports, provided that it is properly structured.

5) And lastly, particularly for the Chicago metropolitan area, some of the under-utilized airports need to be better connected into the local travel network, so that people landing in say Chicago O'Hare can use bus or rail to get to either Rockford or Chicago-Gary to catch a connecting flight.  If we just leave the road system as is, then we have just replaced an air congestion problem with a road congestion problem...primarily in the vicinity of the airports.  There should be alternative forms of transport between airports in a given metropolitan area. 

Some other comments that I have concerning this include the following observations.  

Rockford (Illinois) and Gary (Indiana) have experienced high job losses as many of their traditional industries have closed.  Expanding their under-utilized airports would provide a real ""shot in the arm"" to the local economy when it comes to jobs and economic development.

Also, for the case of Rockford (Illinois), the immediate area around the airport is predominantly rural cornfields, which means that the increase in aircraft noise will not necessarily adversely affect the quality of life for the people living in that vicinity.

For Gary (Indiana), the airport is located in the middle of an industrial zone, which is already noisy, so that is not a problem.  Also, most of the land available for airport expansion is brown fields which is pretty much useless except for other industrial developments or something like and airport.  Any of the so called people that will be displaced are the ones who are are living on the abandoned properties illegally, and they should not be there in the first place.

This might produce air quality, land use and environmental justice benefits in many instances. There may arise specific situations or sites in which keeping track of the percentage occupancy of flights, particularly of large commercial carriers is a desirable means for managing congestion. This peak charge system would be best employed as a well-publicized responsive pricing, or variable pricing system, that reflects the marginal cost of usage at the most intense daily, weekly, monthly and seasonal/holiday peak periods.  This marginal cost is of course partly the delay to others who do or would have used the facility, passengers and carriers alike. I believe that DOT could balance the practical need for carriers to know price in advance, with the greater effectiveness of more variable, or congestion responsive charges.  I propose that prices be calculated or advertised as a schedule of ranges of possible prices depending on time of day or season. Another approach charges flight departures (and conceivably of arrivals) by mimicing an idealized form of automotive HOV/HOT lane: Very full planes could be charged less than very empty planes on a staggered or proportionately increasing fee structure. Or just require that fuller planes pay less, and let the airlines decide whether they are willing to implement things like William Vickrey's market-based ideas for marginal cost ticket pricing, i.e., a ""speculative 'futures market' for ticket sales,"" or some other method.

RE:	Comments on Market-Based Solutions to Relieve Airport Congestion and Delay 
The U.S. Department of Transportation is soliciting comments on possible market-based actions to relieve airport congestion and delay.  These actions, published in the August 21, 2001 Federal Register are designed to reduce delays, improve airport capacity management, enhance competition and promote the efficiency of the overall aviation system.  The proposed actions were prompted by the unprecedented flight delays that had plagued the national aviation system, prior to the recent economic downturn and the events of September 11.  They cover these four basic categories:  
&#61623; Auctions, which would allocate a fixed number of operations for some particular period of time.
&#61623; Congestion pricing, which would which would charge air carriers not only for the costs they impose on an airport, but also the delay costs they impose on other airport users.
&#61623; Peak-period pricing, which would impose fees based on the higher costs and airport incurs to accommodate demand during peak hours, or the cost an airport does not incur because flights are shifted from busy periods of the day to less busy periods.
&#61623; Flat fees, which would restructure exiting weigh-based landing fees so that total airfield costs are recovered through a higher average fee, thereby affecting the mix of aircraft that operate at an airport. 
All of these market-based approaches are aimed at achieving a better balance between supply and demand in the aviation industry, mainly by using airport facilities more than they otherwise would during off-peak periods, and reduce the bunching of flights during peak periods.  To the extent that options are available in a regional system, these actions could also provide inducements to airlines to shift service to less congested alternate airports with lower fee structures.  
There are a number of questions and issues on these proposed actions that the FAA notice poses and requests comments on.  They do not cover legal issues such as potential conflict with current federal aviation law; it is requested that responders set aside consideration of current statutory or regulatory issues in their comments.  The question and issues posed (22 total) cover these basic categories, which are relevant to regional aviation planning:
&#61623; Application of market-based actions: Which specific market-based mechanisms are most promising?  Why?  How should policymakers decide which airports might benefit from the imposition of market-based approaches, and which factors should they consider in making these decisions, such as available capacity, current flight volumes, capacity expansion initiatives, etc.?  
&#61623; Performance standards: What level of delay is acceptable at airports after the imposition of market-based approaches?  Should all delay be eliminated?  How much would user charges have to be increased to shift or reduce demand to meet delay targets?  How would you calculate fees that are based on expansive concept of delay-related costs, including the value of lost time to travelers? How would random factors be taken into account that impact delay, such as weather?  How would approaches be designed to accommodate unexpected demand shifts?  What data is needed to measure the effectiveness of market-based mechanisms?  
&#61623; Surplus revenues: Given that market-based fees could result in airports receiving revenues in excess of their operating and capital costs, should these surplus revenues be used to enhance capacity at the capacity constrained airport, at another airport that is part of the proprietors system, or elsewhere in the aviation system?  How do you determine where, how much and what type of new airport capacity is needed in terms of using surplus revenues?  How would you implement the use of surplus revenues on a systemwide basis?  
&#61623; Secondary airports: Will market-based approaches to airport access increase the use of less-congested secondary airports?  Should airports in the same region that are not under the same ownership have the ability to promote the use underused airports? 
&#61623; Aircraft size and fleet mix: Will market-based approaches encourage or discourage the operation of certain types of aircraft?  Should they be crafted to encourage airlines to operate large aircraft, maximizing the number of seats per operation?  
&#61623; Potential impacts: Would adoption of market-based approaches adversely impact airfares, new entrants, airline competition, hub-and-spoke networks, service to small communities, general aviation, and international air services?  How could such potential adverse impacts be mitigated, such as using differential pricing or exempting certain user categories?  What would be the potential economic benefits/cost savings to airlines, airports and surrounding communities? 
Comments
Following are some suggested comments developed by SCAG aviation staff that can be made that respond to the questions and issues posed above, which are relevant to current and pressing aviation-related issues in the SCAG Region.
1. The SCAG regional airport system is a potential candidate for the fruitful application of market-based approaches to relieve airport congestion and delay.  Our one international hub airport, Los Angeles International (LAX), was one of the most delay-plagued airports in the country before the events of September 11.  At just 3500 acres it is one of the smallest international hub airports in the country, and has little room to expand without causing excessive environmental impacts on surrounding communities.  Yet the region also has a number of underutilized secondary airport in outlying areas that can absorb increased demand.  The lack of airline investments in these airports has been the main stumbling block in decentralizing demand away from our congested urban airports.  
2. Market-based mechanisms, if effective, have the potential to make better use of limited capacity at LAX by spreading demand to off-peak periods, and by inducing airline interest in secondary airports that have substantially lower peak period fee structures than LAX.  It should be noted that a number of secondary airports in the region, including Burbank, Long Beach and John Wayne airports, are all very small and have little room to accommodate future passenger and cargo growth.  Long Beach Airport is subject to a legally enforceable capacity constraint of 41 air carrier flights per day.  Also, Burbank and John Wayne are currently limited by terminal gate capacity, which does not necessarily cause flight delays as does limited runway capacity.
3. The existing physical capacity of LAX is limited by its available runway capacity.  Since no major capacity expansions are currently being planned, when demand recovers in the near future, increasing flight delays at LAX will likely recur.  Market-based mechanisms therefore have potential for making better use of the available runway capacity at LAX in lieu of major runway capacity improvements. However, regional aviation demand modeling that SCAG has conducted over the last ten years indicates that there is a limit to which passengers will accept traveling during off-peak hours, particularly business travelers, even when substantially lower airfares are offered.  Without another large international hub airport in the region, there is also a limit to which international passengers can be diverted to smaller secondary airports in the region that lack the connecting traffic that it needed to support substantial international service to multiple global destinations.  Further, there is a limit to which market based strategies can induce the transition to fleets with larger aircraft at LAX.  This transition is ultimately governed by the ability of the aircraft manufacturing industry to produce new generation aircraft, and the ability of the airline industry to economically amortize their investments in existing aircraft.  It is expected that as LAX reached its capacity constraints, there will be a natural incentive for carriers to use the largest available aircraft in order to carry as many passengers as possible given limitations on flights in the face of growing demand.  
4. Airport-related costs are only about 3-4% of total airline costs.  Landing fees would have to be raised substantially at LAX in order to change airline behavior in terms of inducing them to move service to off-peak periods or alternate secondary airports with far less economies of scale than LAX (but also much less congestion).  The revenue generated would likely be far in excess of what is need to operate, maintain and improve LAX. The public agency that runs LAX, Los Angeles World Airports, also manages two alternate airports: Ontario and Palmdale, to which surplus revenue could be diverted for capacity and enhancements.  However, it has no jurisdiction over three secondary airports in the region with room to expand that could be the beneficiary of the surplus revenues generated: March Global Port, San Bernardino International, and Southern California Logistics airports.  A recently reactivated Southern California Regional Airport Authority (SCRAA) could be an institutional vehicle for deciding how surplus revenues generated by market-based approaches are equitably allocated among airports in the SCAG region.  The SCRAA would need to be substantially reorganized and redirected to accomplish this task however; it currently does not enjoy region-wide support of its current agenda, which is fairly ambiguous.  Efforts by the SCRAA to become a regional broker of airport-generated revenues would likely meet with stiff resistance from the local airport authorities that would generate surplus revenues.  
5. The use of surplus funds generated by market based approaches should not be restricted to just the funding of airport capacity expansion projects.  Consideration should be given to making off-airport ground access projects that primarily serve air travelers and air cargo, and off-airport environmental mitigation projects such as noise retrofit programs, eligible as well.  New standards and criteria would need to be developed for defining permissible uses of surplus funds. 
6. On-airport benefits of market-based strategies should not be limited to just congestion relief.   Consideration should be given to basing fees, at least in part, on air and noise emissions, with lower fees granted to aircraft with engines that emit lower air and noise emissions levels.  The importance of emission fees relative to congestion fees could vary depending on measured noise and air quality impacts on surrounding communities versus total traffic levels.  For example, an airport that handled relatively low levels of traffic but had disproportionately high environmental impacts on surrounding communities would place a much higher relative importance on air and noise emissions per aircraft in setting fees.  Small urban airports in the SCAG Region, such as Burbank, Long Beach and John Wayne, that experience relatively low levels of aircraft congestion but inflict relatively high amount of environmental impacts per aircraft operation on surrounding communities would be prime candidates for this type of market-based approach.  It should be noted that currently there is little or no incentive for airlines to install pollution control retrofit devices on their engines, even through those devices have proven to be very cost effective in reducing largely uncontrolled emissions such as nitrous oxides.  There is also little incentive for airlines to change their current practice of installing hush kit equipment on old aircraft engines that allow them to just barely meet federal noise standards, instead of re-engining their aircraft with the latest engine technology that reduces aircraft noise levels far below current standards.  Zurich Airport in Switzerland is an example of airport that has successfully implemented a market-based emission fee program, and has enjoyed cleaner and quieter aircraft operations as a result. 
7. There are many questions and issues posed by the Notice that simply cannot be answered in any definitive manner due to a lack of evidence and data.  These include which market based measures are most promising, which factors should decision makers consider in applying the measure, how much delay is acceptable, how high should fees be set to reach desired levels of delay, what criteria should fees be based on, and what data is needed to measure effectiveness of measures?  They also ask how do you make the measures flexible, what would be the impacts on small communities and international service, would they increase the use of less congested secondary airports, and what would be the potential cost savings and benefits to airlines, airports and local communities?  Case studies and pilot programs need to be conducted in order to establish an information base, derived from actual experience, which can be used to help answer these and other questions.   It is suggested that the SCAG regional airport system provides a wide variety of airport types and aviation issues, and would be a good testing ground for evaluating the effectiveness of market-based actions in reducing congestion and delay, and reducing environmental impacts of airports on local communities.  SCAG has developed and employed state-of-the-art modeling tools, such as the RADAM airport demand allocation model, that could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of market-based actions on a regional basis.

Simply charge one fixed landing fee for all users, reguardless of size or content of the aircraft! The amount should be based on the level of congestion and market driven. This is a very simple and equitable solution which rewards less congestion with the use of larger, more efficient service with less frequency, which is what the airports need. There may be very limited exceptions for air ambulance, or maybe essential air service, but that is about it. An aircraft, no matter what the size, uses the same amount of airspace and air traffic control resources. Let's make the most efficient use of the finite amount available by encouraging economy of landings.


An aircraft, no matter what the size, requires the same amount of airspace and air traffic control resources. The obvious remedy for airport congestion would be to charge accordingly. There should be one fixed price landing fee for all landings, reguardless of the aircraft size or type. The amount would be market driven and determined by the amount of congestion at each airport. This program would encourage the use of a small number of large aircraft over a large number of small aircraft thus maintaining the passenger count while reducing congestion in the air.",,,,,,,"postmarkDate, Answer Date, Date the document was postmarked"

You need to use comments by people who work in the airline industry, not just file them away...  Every idea I have sent the FAA has been filed away and I as an airline employee I continue to suffer.  I have been in the airline industry for over 20 years. I have been in airline management as a route and planning analyst, pricing analyst, operation center and many other hats.  I have worked in airport customer service (gates, baggage, ticket counter), and ramp and air freight operations.   Give me the authority and I will fix the system. I see the problems daily, and know why the airlines will not change and why the FAA was blinders on.  Airlines are taking delays because of restrictions like additional security of selectees and checking IDs at the gate...Example: An 757 aircraft arrives late, it takes about 10 to deboard 100 passengers, it takes 15 minutes to clean (if you have 5 cleaners), it takes 5 miutes to put on special assist passengers, now it takes 7 minutes (5 minutes prior to not checking IDs, which should be done at security because airline employees are trained or have the data base of the government for ID fraud) to board 50 passengers.  A 757 has 182 passengers and should take 25 minutes to board, but selectees can not be sent to be screened until they board.  After boarding all passengers not selectees, the flight has to wait additional 10 minutes until the selectees are screened.  Are we protecting the building or the aircraft...If we are protecting the aircraft why not have passengers go thru security at a secured enclosed gate area where passengers can go into 1 hour prior.  This would increase the number of selectee to go thru hand screenings and not delaying flights.  There are soo many problems the FAA is not addressing that should be fixed.  Give me the authority and I will fix the system.   K. Torres

The average frequent traveller is already subject to an exorbitant tax burden. For instance - look at the tax breakdown for a typical weekend excursion from the NYC metro area to Las Vegas:

public transportation to airport:  $48 including $14 to subsidize airport construction (58% tax rate)
airfare: $550 (for 2) including $70 in taxes (15% tax rate)
car rental: $250 including $55 in taxes (28% tax rate)
hotel: $673 including $56 in taxes (9% tax rate)

All this adds up to $209 in taxes on $1312 in travel costs - an average 16% tax rate. This is in excess of the nearly 40% income tax already paid to these same entities which are levying the additional tax. Therefore, in order for one to take a $1312 trip - the real cost in earned dollars is $2535! Nearly half the cost of the trip is sucked up by federal, state, and local governments. 

In return for one's $1223 tax bill, it does not seem unreasonable to expect these entities which are clearly getting a substantial amount of cash flow from travelers to actually expend that on making travel better for those same taxpayers. This can be accomplished by modernizing the nation's air traffic control system and expanding airports in spite of leftist environmental protests. Air travel is essential to America's economy and strangling it is just plain anticapitalist.

The U.S. Department of Transportation Comments on Market-based Solutions to Relieve Airport Congestion and Delay  


Docket #  OST-2001-9849,

July 22, 2002
 
The Sierra Club sees an environmental value in market-based policies that achieve more efficient use of existing infrastructure. Let government emulate sound business practice so as to alleviate airport congestion and reduce the perceived need for airport expansion. We are confident that differential peak/off peak charges, tailored to individual airports, would level out demand-related peaks of congestion. Study is required to examine consequences for service networks, to estimate savings to airport users, and to formulate procedures for handling real-world situations such as weather-induced delays. Such studies should be for the purpose of design and implementation, not for indefinite postponement.

These federal charges on aircraft takeoffs and landings would need to be of sufficient magnitude during daily and seasonal peaks to stimulate more efficient use of airport and airways infrastructure, and to encourage, in the minds of carriers and customers alike, more awareness of congestion costs when scheduling and selecting flights.  Congestion pricing would encourage airline management to get rid of low revenue flights and to maximize load factors. They would adapt to the existence of congestion pricing to maximize their revenues; the peak charge policy would fulfill its intended purpose.  Effective runway use and beneficial environmental outcomes would result.  Congestion pricing is a behavior modification device. As such, it has to be well defined and publicized so that people can plan, can indeed modify their behavior.  At most airports, pricing must encompass general aviation aircraft as well as airliners. Military aircraft may have to be accommodated in some cases.

We feel that it is of critical importance that the DOT insure that existing infrastructure is being used as efficiently as possible before the general taxpayer is given the bill for more airport expansions.  The space and resource intensive nature of such infrastructure expansions calls for such a policy.  Its benefits to the smooth and more efficient use of existing airports and the air navigation system further underscore the appropriateness of pursuing it at this time. 

We also believe that the direct users should incur the charges for air travel infrastructure, i.e., the air carriers or other aircraft operators themselves.  This involves issues of opportunity costs of public fiscal outlays and of land uses precluded by the presence of the airports, and of taxpayer-general fund equity.  The fact is that this type of market-based measure would help to create a more accurate sense of what changes in air travel infrastructure or other modes are truly needed.  

Subsidies to air travel should be reduced, particularly to the degree at which they might hinder demand for land modes that are less polluting, particularly rail service.  To that end, we suggest that DOT conduct studies to include consideration of federal support of rail service as an alternative for those tolled off by peak pricing. This might require collaboration with other agencies. Short hauls and service to small communities are some examples. 

USDOT might also promote public transportation linkages between airports, the regions they serve, and metropolitan areas and their airports within the 100 to 500 mile distance easily accessed by improved inter city rail. Such linkages could enhance market approaches by providing convenient, cost-effective and environmentally sound options to travelers.  They could also help mitigate costly airport expansions, and accompanying environmental justice, air quality, public health and habitat impacts.

Therefore, we urge you to:
* design and implement higher takeoff and landing fees at peak demand times, highest (when needed) for those craft with the fewest passengers;
* use the revenue to build and operate inter city rail service to relieve
airport congestion, including reservations and ticketing done jointly by transit and airlines; and
* use the revenue to also build and operate public transit to
airports from nearby cities

We commend the USDOT for this solicitation for comments and hope that demand side management and market-based measures will be researched and implemented expeditiously to address airport and airways congestion problems.  Top priority should go to differential peak/off peak charges.

Thank You,

The last time the CRS rules were revised were in 1992. This is now the fifth extension to a March 31, 1997 deadline. Technology is changing so fast that it is imperative that you make some rule changes immediately before your overall review is completed.

Consumers are frequently not getting the lowest airfares because of the wide pricing variations that the airlines are using to keep everyone confused. Airfare price differences provided by On line travel agencies, airline websites and in Brick & Mortar travel agents CRS;s are so common today that the consumer is lucky to be able to find the lowest fare even with hours and hours of research.

Many consumers have been excluded access to the lowest fares because they do not have internet access. Brick and Mortar travel agents have been excluded from selling these lower fares because they are not allowed to book these fares for their customers. Most all internet sites do not allow a third party to book these tickets.

In order for the consumer to find and have access to the lowest airfares, you need to make these fares available to all channels of the distribution system.

Without this change to the rules, most of the Brick and Mortar travel agencies will either quit selling airline tickets or will go out of business. One more year may not seem like a long time to you, but to the travel agency industry today who has patiently waited 5 years for some sort of ruling, it is an eternity.

Thank you for listening to my comments.

DOT seeks delay in setting CRS rule changes(2/14/2002)

By Andrew Compart 

WASHINGTON -- Will the Transportation Department ever change the CRS rules? The DOT insists it will, but is proposing the fifth extension of its original Dec. 31, 1997 deadline. 
This latest one-year extension, proposed Feb. 14 and almost certain to be adopted, would give the DOT until the end of March 2003 to complete a rulemaking that has continually grown in scope. 

The DOT, for example, is considering whether the rules should be extended to Internet booking sites, and agents have argued the rules should require giving them access to what have been Web-only fares. 

Regarding the latest proposed extension, the DOT said, ""The department recognizes that our re-examination of the rules should be as completed as soon as possible, and the staff is moving forward promptly to bring the rulemaking to completion."" The DOT, however, did not provide a timetable. 

The DOT last revised the CRS rules in 1992. 

The deadline extension actually is an extension of the current CRS rules, which otherwise would expire at the end of March of this year. Previous extensions of those rules have generated little or no opposition, although some people have asked the DOT to rule on individual CRS-related issues while the overall review continues. 

Anyone who wishes to comment on the proposed extension can send comments marked as DOT docket number OST-2002-11577 to Docket Management Facility, U.S. Department of Transportation, room PL-401, 400 7th St. SW, Washington, DC 20590-0001.

WASHINGTON -- The National Business Travel Association joined the fight against Web-only fares, telling the Transportation Department they are bad for corporations and corporate travel managers. 
The best solution, according to nearly every travel manager that responded to a February NBTA survey, is to give corporations equal access to the fares. The NBTA, which filed its comments Feb. 13, wants the DOT to consider the issue in its ongoing review of CRS rules. 

When corporate travelers locate and book cheaper fares online, the corporations cannot track the employee, help them if something happens on the trip or arrange last-minute changes, upgrades or refunds, the NBTA said. 

In addition, the surveyed travel managers said the use of Web-only fares makes it difficult for companies to influence traveler choices or reach volume thresholds in their contractual commitments with airlines. To reach those volume thresholds, many companies forbid their employees from booking travel on the Internet, the travel managers said. 

An NBTA spokeswoman said corporate travel managers ""are being bombarded now by employees who are coming up with Web fares."" One manager, for example, reported getting at least four such calls a day.

If you are going to change the rules regarding WEB fares, do it NOW.  Agencies and corporations are having to find alternate short term solutions which cost time and money to figure out.  DOT has the power to make a ruling that will point us all in the right direction.

The public is deprived of customer service in regard to airline travel without travel agents. With web bookings they get no help if something goes wrong!

a responsibility to stand up for ALL citizens, and create a new set

in technology since 1992, the last time the rules were amended.
These discriminatory ""web-only"" fares are allowing the airlines to
charge higher prices to elderly and lower-income travelers, and it is
only a matter of time before they realize this, and file action against the airlines in federal court.  Please act sooner rather than
later to address this inequity.

Every airline and web site is offering fares not available to major corporations through our normal purchasing procedures.  Also, airlines and web sites are marketing directly to our travelers encouraging them to book outside their companies policy.  It is not fair for airlines to allow distribution of these fares to a specific group of purchasers - these fares must be made available to ALL the traveling public regardless of the method of distribution.  To allow a special discount for purchasing through its own distribution center when contracts are in place with various companies that are based on the companies performance, seems to form collusion - the airlines are forcing us to either errode our negotiated contracts, allow travel outside of policy or eliminate as much travel from our company as possible.

Brown ",,,false,DOT-OST-2002-11741-0116,,,2002-04-30T04:00Z,2002-04-30T04:00Z,,,,,,,,"Comment(s)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alan","Brown","Brussels","Belgium","1000",,,,,,,,"IACA believes that this proposal from NACA would take US licensing matters back 20 years. There are differences between both EU and US markets. What has to be bourn in mind is that the reason EU carriers operate 7th freedom flights ex USA is because they are unable to 'wet lease' to US carriers, thus the US Tour Operators have to look to foreign carriers to provide the lift that in a European context carriers would justify for commercial necessity under EU 8.3 waiver procedures. EU operators therefore wish to operate 7th freedom flights as this equates to US carriers wet leasing into the EU market. IACA does not believe it is a straight matter of should the US allow 7th freedom flights or not, as the examples quoted below illustrate. In addition, IACA is advised that as an example, the UK Government has satisfied the US DoT that full reciprocity exists to permit US carriers to operate 7th freedom flights from the UK. IACA therefore registers its preliminary comments to Docket No. OST-2002-11741 and reserves the right to make follow-up comments at a later stage in proceedings.

Example.
To take an illustrative example from the UK experience:  A UK Tour operator A asks two UK carriers b & c in the UK to quote for a line of flying. Both carriers quote and b has an aircraft available yet c does not have sufficient capacity.  However Tour operator A decides that the service and quotation of carrier c is his preferred commercial option and contracts with carrier c. The only way carrier c can operate the flights is to wet lease a foreign registered aircraft. Under EU regulations this is permitted - the UK would not accept objection from carrier b on the grounds that they have availability and did not get the contract. In other words the tour operator is not constrained by who he is able to do business. Conversely within the US, say that a US Tour operator A approaches US carriers b & c for a line of flying. Carrier b has availability, carrier c does not have any availability thus his only option is to dry lease, but the cost of employing additional flight and cabin crews to cover 6 months flying for example makes the product too expensive for the tour operator, unlike the UK carrier b does not have the ability to wet lease to keep annual fleet costs at an acceptable level. Thus tour operator A looks at other options and that is to approach foreign carriers to operate that same line of flying under 5th freedom (known as 7th's). This enables the US tour operator to have the same flexibility of commercial decision making as the UK tour operator. Otherwise he would be forced to use a carrier that he was not commercially satisfied with.

ASA's members constantly find themselves in business relationships with air carriers.  Air carriers are customers who purchase parts.  They are also business partners who serve as the source of surplus inventory.  The economic health of domestic air carriers is important to the domestic distribution market.



We are concerned that the Department of Transportation's regulations pertaining to charter air transportation define U.S. originating charter traffic in a manner that is inconsistent with the definitions of similar traffic that are used by our foreign trading partners.  Furthermore, the definition is different in its application to similar U.S. originating scheduled air traffic.  



The events of September 11th have clearly demonstrated the close relationship between the aircraft parts distribution industry and the Part 121 air carrier industry in the United States.  Impacting these economic relationships can have an adverse effect on safety when companies with robust quality systems go out of business and are replaced by newwer companies without robust quality systems.



Providing definitions of air traffic privileges that are consistent with international norms does more than support a level playing field for all international commerce.  By permiting domestic air carriers to compete on a level playing field, the government permits the entire aviation infrastructure to thrive in an atmosphere of fair competition.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2002-11741-0061/attachment_1.rtf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/DOT-OST-2002-11741-0061/attachment_1.pdf","postmarkDate, Answer Date, Date the document was postmarked"

In my 12-year commercial aviation career, Ive been forced to change employers four times. In each of these highly stressful situations, the change has been due to the failure of the Airline, resulting in its bankruptcy and a period of unemployment for myself. While one of my past employers was a moderately sized scheduled air carrier, the others, including my current employer, are involved in the ""supplemental"" area of the part 121 industry.

The NACA-supported petition in Docket OST-2002-11741 is, in my view, fair and reasonable. More than that, it is necessary. With the entire airline industry in economic turmoil, it seems clear to me that additional steps must be taken to aid, as well as insure the stability of, as many ""supplemental"" U.S. airlines as possible. The right of first refusal for U.S. carriers is an excellent way to help firm up the supplemental passenger and cargo areas of the airline industry. An additional benefit of this amendment will be aiding those supplemental carriers that participate in the CRAF program. Not only will the carrier benefit,  so will the operational flexibility of the U.S. military.  Furthermore, the traveling U.S. public deserves the highest safety and security standards available from a U.S.-based carrier.

In a turbulent post-September 11 world, it is high time we exercise our right to prioritize ourselves and our interests.  Since the rest of the world looks to the U.S. for aide, should we not take the time to get our own economy and industrial base in order?

MEMORANDUM FOR PRESIDENT=S MANAGEMENT COUNCIL

FROM:		John D. Graham

SUBJECT:		Agency Draft Information Quality Guidelines

The quality of information disseminated to the public by the Federal Government needs to be improved.  

Reflecting this need, Congress recently directed OMB to issue government-wide guidelines that Aprovide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies.@  The Administration is committed to vigorous implementation of this information quality law.  

OMB issued government-wide information quality guidelines on September 28 last year.  Each Federal agency is now required to issue its own guidelines that will ensure the quality of information that it disseminates.  These guidelines must include mechanisms to allow the public to seek correction of disseminated information that does not comply with the information quality standards in the OMB or agency guidelines.  To permit public participation and comment, and to facilitate interagency coordination, agencies are expected to make their draft guidelines available for public comment.  

My staff and I have completed a preliminary review of the draft agency guidelines currently available for public comment.  We want to thank you for the substantial effort and careful deliberation reflected in the agency drafts.  Agencies, with highly diverse program responsibilities, disseminate a wide variety of kinds of information to serve many different purposes.  The agency drafts properly reflect this variety.  

Some agencies have developed particularly noteworthy provisions that I would suggest for consideration by other agencies in reviewing and revising their own draft guidance.  I would also like to point out some provisions in agency drafts that do not appear consistent with the text and intent of the OMB guidelines or are otherwise contrary to Administration policy.

Based on our review, I have attached a discussion of important issues, identified noteworthy approaches for consideration, and provided guidance on those provisions that need to be adopted uniformly in all agency guidance.  I request that you send this attachment to the appropriate officials who are responsible for developing your agency=s information quality guidelines. 

We have asked agencies to submit draft final guidelines to us for review by August 1 (which we have extended from an original July 1 deadline).  We encourage you to use this extra time to extend your public comment period.  In light of the recent decision to allow additional time for agencies to extend the period for public comment on agency guidelines (and thus compress the time available for final OMB review), it is my intention to have these OIRA comments considered in conjunction with public comments as agencies shape their final guidelines.

As a related matter, I should note that Mark Forman of OMB is leading work on a content model for presenting information on the web.  It will include guidelines on how to present web content, how agencies should identify web-based material, and general guidelines for what should go on the public internet.

OIRA REVIEW OF 
INFORMATION QUALITY GUIDELINES DRAFTED BY AGENCIES


By October 1, 2002, agencies must publish in the Federal Register a notice that the agency=s final guidelines are available on the Internet.  Agencies must also provide OMB an opportunity to review each agency=s draft final guidelines before they are issued.  Drafts must be submitted to OMB no later than August 1.

The underlying legislation is Section 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-554; H.R. 5658).   The OMB Information Quality Guidelines can be found in the Federal Register for September 28, 2001 (66 FR 49718), and, as amended, for February 22, 2002 (67 FR 8452).  

This attachment discusses important policy issues raised by the agency drafts, identifies noteworthy approaches for consideration, and provides guidance on those provisions that need to be uniformly adopted in all agency information quality guidelines.  We urge that draft guidelines submitted for OMB review reflect consideration of this guidance as well as the public comments.


I.  SCOPE OF AGENCY GUIDELINES.

In this topic, we discuss a number of constructive approaches agencies used to define the kinds of information that are covered by their guidelines.  In some cases, we refer to provisions from agency drafts.  These examples are quoted at the end of this attachment.

We cite these agency draft provisions as useful constructive approaches.  We caution, however, that these examples are only agency proposals.  Based on public comment and other review, the agencies may further refine these examples.

The OMB definitions of Ainformation@ and Adissemination@ establish the scope of these guidelines.  Both definitions contain exceptions.  Agencies have elaborated upon the definitions of information and dissemination, and the exceptions thereto, to both broaden and narrow their scope.  The specific examples discussed below include modifications that appear reasonable and consistent with the approach OMB takes in its guidelines, as well as suggestions for improvement and greater consistency with the OMB guidelines.  We suggest that agencies consider these approaches for their own use.

Use of Statements of AIntent@ to Define Scope.  Some agencies used statements of intent or purpose to limit the scope of these guidelines.  Such use of Aintent@ clarifies the nature of the inclusion or exclusion in a way to avoid having incidental or inadvertent public disclosure undermine the practical administration of the definition or exclusion.  For example, some agencies insert the concept of Aintent@ into the exemption for intra- or inter-agency use of sharing of information, e.g., exempted is Ainformation ... not disseminated to the public, including documents intended only for inter-agency and intra-agency communications@ (ED, 1 & 4).  On the other hand, some agencies quote this definition as stated in the OMB guidelines literally, and do not insert a concept of intent.  They may wish to include a concept of Aintent@ to avoid inadvertent public disclosure from undermining practical administration of the guidelines.

Exemption for Press Releases.  Some agencies narrowed the exemption in the OMB definition to provide that the agency should already have disseminated the information discussed in the press release in another way.  For example, EPA states AThese guidelines do not apply to press releases, fact sheets, press conferences or similar communications in any medium that announce, support the announcement or give public notice of information EPA has disseminated elsewhere@ (EPA, 15).  This limitation avoids creating an incentive to misuse press releases to circumvent information quality standards.

Exemption for Public Filings.  Some agencies refined the exemption for public filings to permit agencies to Apass through@ information not subject to the guidelines while properly applying the agency and OMB guidelines to third-party information that the agency disseminates.  Agencies need to qualify the public filing exemption to ensure that the agency guidelines continue to apply to third-party information that the agency disseminates, as we discuss below under II, ACoverage of >Third-Party= Information under the Guidelines.@

Exclusion For Agency Employed Scientist, Grantee, or Contractor.  The preamble to the OMB guidelines discusses situations in which the dissemination of information by an agency-employed scientist, grantee, or contractor is not subject to the guidelines, namely those situations in which they Apublish and communicate their research findings in the same manner as their academic colleagues@ and thus do not imply official agency endorsement of their views or findings (67 FR 8453-54, February 22, 2002).  On the other hand, an agency disseminates information Awhere an agency has directed a third-party to disseminate information, or where the agency has the authority to review and approve the information before release@ (67 FR 8454, February 22, 2002).  Agencies that did not explicitly include such an exemption may wish to consider doing so, but need to do so in the carefully balanced ways quoted at the end of this attachment.

Exclusion for Testimony and Other Submissions to Congress.  Some agencies exclude Ainformation presented to Congress (as part of the legislative or oversight processes, e.g., testimony of officials, information or drafting assistance provided to Congress in connection with pending or proposed legislation) that is not simultaneously disseminated to the public@ (Justice, 3; DOT, 9).  As with the exemption for press releases, we think it would be better for agencies to narrow this exemption to provide that the agency should already have disseminated the information discussed in the testimony in another way.  This limitation would avoid creating an incentive to misuse testimony and other submissions to Congress to circumvent information quality standards.

Exemption for Subpoenas or Adjudicative Processes.  The preamble to the OMB guidelines states that AThe exemption from the definition of >dissemination= for >adjudicative processes= is intended to exclude ... the findings and determinations that an agency makes in the course of adjudications involving specific parties.  There are well-established procedural safeguards and rights to address the quality of adjudicatory decisions and to provide persons with an opportunity to contest decisions.  These guidelines do not impose any additional requirements on agencies during adjudicative proceedings and do not provide parties to such adjudicative proceedings any additional rights of challenge or appeal@ (67 FR 8454, February 22, 2002).  Some agencies adapted the OMB exception very carefully.  Other agencies may have broadened this exemption beyond OMB=s intent; they need to limit this exemption carefully to be consistent with OMB=s intent both as to the adjudicative procedures that are included and the scope of the information covered.

Effective Date.  The OMB guidelines establish two somewhat different effective dates (III.4).  An agency=s obligation to conduct a pre-dissemination review of information quality starts only on October 1: AThe agency=s pre-dissemination review, under paragraph III.2, shall apply to information that the agency first disseminates on or after October 1, 2002.@  An agency=s obligation to allow the public to seek the  correction of information that does not comply with the information quality standards in OMB or agency guidelines starts on October 1, 2002, for information that the agency disseminates on or after October 1, 2002, even if the agency first disseminated that information before October 1: AThe agency=s administrative mechanisms, under paragraph III.3, shall apply to information that the agency disseminates on or after October 1, 2002, regardless of when the agency first disseminated the information.@  

Some agencies followed the OMB guidelines carefully in describing when the information quality guidelines will take effect:  AThe DOJ information quality guidelines will become effective on October 1, 2002.  These guidelines will cover information disseminated on or after October 1, 2002, regardless of when the information was first disseminated@ (Justice,  2).   Other agencies need to be careful to track accurately the OMB guidelines in this regard (III.4).

The effective date for the agency=s administrative mechanisms raises the issue of what constitutes agency dissemination of information after October 1, 2002, if the agency first disseminated this information earlier.

DOT defines dissemination after October 1 to exclude archived information that had been disseminated previously.  AAs provided in OMB=s guidelines, these guidelines apply only to information disseminated on or after October 1, 2002.  The fact that an information product that was disseminated by DOT before this date is still maintained by the Department (e.g., in DOT=s files, in publications that DOT continues to distribute on a website) does not make the information subject to these guidelines or to the request for correction process@ (DOT,  23).  This interpretation is consistent with OMB=s intent, and equivalent to the Aarchival records@ exemption.

Still to be considered is how a complainant demonstrates that an agency disseminates information after October 1, 2002, if the agency first disseminated that information before October 1, 2002.  For example, existing official agency data bases, publicly available through agency websites or other means, that serve agency program responsibilities and/or are relied upon by the public as official government data, need to be subject to the Section 515 administrative mechanisms to address public complaints because they are, in effect, constantly being redisseminated.  


II.  COVERAGE OF ATHIRD-PARTY@ INFORMATION UNDER THE GUIDELINES.

The preamble to the OMB guidelines states, AIf an agency, as an institution, disseminates information prepared by an outside party in a manner that reasonably suggests that the agency agrees with the information, this appearance of having the information represent agency views makes agency dissemination of the information subject to these guidelines@ (67 FR 8454, February 22, 2002).  Reinforcing this statement of policy, OMB also provided an example in its preamble concerning the applicability of the OMB and agency information quality standards to third-party studies relied upon by an agency as support for a proposed rulemaking, even if the third-party studies had been published before the agency=s use of them (67 FR 8457, February 22, 2002).

DOT incorporated these principles from the OMB guidelines by stating that an agency disseminates information if it relies on information in support of a rulemaking.   AIf the Department is to rely on technical, scientific, or economic information submitted by, for example, a commenter to a proposed rule, that information would need to meet appropriate standards of objectivity and utility@ (DOT, 3). AThe standards of these guidelines apply not only to information that DOT generates, but also to information that other parties provide to DOT, if the other parties seek to have the Department rely upon or disseminate this information or the Department decides to do so@  (DOT, 8).

EPA explicitly includes a provision embodying the OMB example: AIf a particular distribution of information is not covered by these guidelines, the guidelines may still apply to a subsequent distribution of the information in which EPA adopts, endorses or uses the information to formulate or support a regulation, guidance, or other Agency decision or position@ (EPA, 17).   
Other agencies B particularly those likely to be involved with using and/or disseminating Ainfluential@ information B must include similar provisions in their guidelines.


III.  AGENCY COMMITMENT TO INFORMATION QUALITY STANDARDS.

In this topic, we discuss (1) ways in which agencies need to commit to information quality standards, and (2) aspects of how those standards should be defined.

Performance Standards.  The OMB guidelines state that, AOverall, agencies shall adopt a basic standard of quality (including objectivity, utility, and integrity) as a performance goal and should take appropriate steps to incorporate information quality criteria into agency information dissemination practices@ (III.1).  The Ainformation quality criteria@ are set forth in the definitions of AQuality,@ AUtility,@ AObjectivity,@ and AIntegrity@ (V.1-4).  Closely related definitions are those for Ainfluential@ information, when used in the phrase Ainfluential scientific, financial, or statistical information,@ and for Areproducibility@ (V.9-10).

Each agency, in structuring its information quality guidelines, must state the agency=s information quality criteria (as defined in the OMB and agency guidelines) as performance goals that the agency seeks to attain.  Each agency needs to adopt explicitly each aspect of each definition of quality, utility, objectivity, and integrity as an agency information quality standard.  Each agency also must explicitly state that it intends to achieve each standard.  Otherwise, there will be no benchmark against which a public complainant will be able to suggest non-attainment. 

The OMB guidelines also state that, AAs a matter of good and effective agency information resources management, agencies shall develop a process for reviewing the quality (including the objectivity, utility, and integrity) of information before it is disseminated@ (III.2).  Given that guideline, many agencies describe in considerable detail the kinds of activities they now undertake to assure information quality.  Regardless, we stress that a mere description of current practices B however good B is not a substitute for explicit performance goals.  At a minimum, each agency must embrace the OMB quality definitions as information quality standards they are seeking to attain.  Examples of constructive agency statements are quoted at the end of this attachment.  

In addition, some agencies and agency components do not appear to have adopted any standards for information quality (utility, objectivity, integrity) and/or defined Ainfluential@ or Areproducibility@ in ways applicable to them.  Each agency must either define its standards in ways applicable to it and consistent with the standards in the OMB guidelines, or explicitly adopt the standards from the OMB guidelines as the agency or component standards.  For an agency that does not anticipate disseminating much information that is defined as Ainfluential@, we suggest that the agency simply adopt the standards from the OMB guidelines as its own.

Core Definition of AObjectivity@.   The OMB definition of  Aobjectivity@ is the most detailed and complex.  This definition has different aspects, some that apply to all information covered by the OMB guidelines, others that apply only to Ainfluential@ information.  

The first issue relates to all covered information.  According to the OMB guidelines, A >Objectivity= has two distinct elements, presentation and substance.  
a.  >Objectivity= includes whether disseminated information is being presented in an accurate, clear, complete and unbiased manner [ -- as well as Awithin a proper context@]. ...
b.   In addition, >objectivity= involves a focus on ensuring accurate, reliable, and unbiased information@ (V.3.). 

Some agencies have summarized this aspect of the definition of Aobjectivity@ accurately.  Other agencies, in summarizing the OMB standard, appear to have left out some of the important standards; those agencies need to summarize the OMB standard accurately.  

Peer Review.  The discussion of peer review in the definition of Aobjectivity@ relates to all covered information.  AIf data and analytic results have been subject to formal, independent, external peer review, the information may generally be presumed to be of acceptable objectivity [if the peer review satisfies >the general criteria for competent and credible peer review= cited in the definition].  However, this presumption is rebuttable based on a persuasive showing by the petitioner in a particular instance@ (V.3.b.i).  

If an agency or component engages in peer review, it needs to discuss the ways in which it will adhere to the OMB standard in its guidelines.  These peer review standards are not limited to information defined as Ainfluential@.  These OMB peer review standards apply to all information covered by these guidelines, and need to be integrated into existing agency peer review standards applicable to covered information.  In addition, agencies must point out B to be consistent with the OMB standard B that the presumption of objectivity afforded to formal, independent, external peer review is rebuttable, although the burden of proof, as explained more fully below, is on the complainant.

AInfluential@ and AReproducibility@.  The next issue relates to agency treatment of influential  information.  AIf an agency is responsible for disseminating influential scientific, financial, or statistical information, agency guidelines shall include a high degree of transparency about data and methods to facilitate the reproducibility of such information by qualified third parties@ (V.3.b.ii; see V.9 for definition of Ainfluential@).

Several agencies provided a carefully considered discussion of the meaning of Ainfluential@ in their drafts.  See provisions quoted at the end of this attachment.

AOriginal and supporting data@ and Aanalytic results@.  With regard to influential information, the OMB guidelines further distinguish between Aoriginal and supporting data@ and Aanalytic results@. 

With regard to original and supporting data related thereto, agency guidelines shall not require that all disseminated data be subjected to a reproducibility requirement.  Agencies may identify, in consultation with the relevant scientific and technical communities, those particular types of data that can practicably be subjected to a reproducibility requirement (V.3.b.ii.A).

With regard to analytic results related thereto, agency guidelines shall generally require sufficient transparency about data and methods that an independent reanalysis could be undertaken by a qualified member of the public. ...   
i. ... Making the data and methods publicly available will assist in determining whether analytic results are reproducible.  However, the objectivity standard does not override other compelling interests such as privacy, trade secrets, intellectual property, and other confidentiality protections.
ii.In situations where public access ... will not occur ..., agencies shall  apply especially rigorous robustness checks to analytic results and document what checks were undertaken.  Agency guidelines shall, in all cases, require a disclosure of the specific data sources ... used and the specific quantitative methods and assumptions ... employed (V.3.b.ii.B). 

In draft agency guidelines, it does not appear that any agency undertook to delineate when Aoriginal and supporting data@ would be subject to a reproducibility requirement.  Presumably, the public comment period is being used to seek views from the relevant scientific and technical communities.  If, at the end of the public comment period, an agency is not prepared to identify what kinds of original and supporting data will be subject to the reproducibility standard, then the agency must include in its guidelines a statement to the effect that the agency shall assure reproducibility for those kinds of original and supporting data according to Acommonly accepted scientific, financial, or statistical standards@ (suggested language).

As to Aanalytic results,@ it appears that a number of agencies anticipate that reproducibility will sometimes not be achievable through public access because of confidentiality protections or other compelling interests.  In such cases, some agencies do not mention the need to Aapply especially rigorous robustness checks.@  Instead, they describe their intent to disclose specific data sources and specific quantitative methods and assumptions. 
In such situations, agencies need to state explicitly their commitment to the standards stated in the OMB guidelines to applying Aespecially rigorous robustness checks@ to analytic results and document what checks were undertaken.  In addition, agency guidelines must, in all cases, explicitly require a disclosure of the specific data sources, quantitative methods, and assumptions used.  We also recommend that agencies, in generating (or contracting to generate) influential information for dissemination, encourage arrangements that will permit appropriate public access to the related original and supporting data and analytic results.

Analysis of Risks to Human Health, Safety and the Environment.  With regard to influential information, the OMB guidelines also state that, AWith regard to analysis of risks to human health, safety and the environment ..., agencies shall either adopt or adapt the quality principles applied by Congress to risk information used and disseminated pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 (42 U.S.C. 300g-1(b)(3)(A) & (B))@ (V.3.b.ii.C).
Some agencies discussed these Congressional risk information quality standards; some agencies discussed these in a limited context; and other agencies failed to mention these standards at all.  Those agencies that are likely to use and/or disseminate influential information in their analysis of Arisks to human health, safety, and the environment@ need to clearly state that they are adopting the SDWA standards, or justify in what ways and for what kinds of information the agency is adapting the SDWA standards.  FDA adapts the SDWA standards in a carefully considered, practical way (HHS/FDA, 18-20).  We note that FDA read the SDWA standards as applicable to a risk assessment document made available to the public and did not limit their applicability only to documents related to a rulemaking; that is the proper approach. 


IV.  QUALITY INTEGRAL TO CREATION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.

The OMB guidelines state that AAs a matter of good and effective agency information resources management, agencies shall treat information quality as integral to every step of an agency=s development of information, including creation, collection, maintenance, and dissemination.  This process shall enable the agency to substantiate the quality of the information it has disseminated through documentation or other means appropriate to the information@ (III.2).  Consistent with the OMB guidelines, the Small Business Administration explicitly included Ainformation development@, Ainformation acquisition@, and Ainformation maintenance@ within the scope of its information quality guidelines, as quoted at the end of this attachment.

In this light, we note that each agency is already required to demonstrate the Apractical utility@ of a proposed collection of information in its PRA submission, i.e., for draft information collections designed to gather information that the agency plans to disseminate.  Thus, we think it important that each agency should declare in its guidelines that it will demonstrate in its PRA clearance packages that each such draft information collection will result in information that will be collected, maintained, and used in a way consistent with the OMB and agency information quality standards.  It is important that we make use of the PRA clearance process to help improve the quality of information that agencies collect and disseminate.  Thus, OMB will approve only those information collections that are likely to obtain data that will comply with the OMB and agency information quality guidelines.


V.  ADMINISTRATIVE MECHANISM TO ADDRESS PUBLIC COMPLAINTS.

Applicable Standards.  The OMB guidelines state, ATo facilitate public review, agencies shall establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain, where appropriate, timely correction of information maintained and disseminated by the agency that does not comply with OMB or agency guidelines@ (III.3).

Some agencies discuss compliance with both the OMB and agency information quality standards in their discussion of the complaint mechanism.  Others discuss compliance only with the agency information quality standards.  To be consistent with the OMB guidelines, each agency should explicitly refer complainants to all of the applicable guidelines B the OMB, department, and departmental component=s guidelines B as the applicable information quality standards.

AAffected Person@.  Some agencies defined Aaffected person@ quite broadly.  For example, AThe term >affected person= means anyone who may benefit or be harmed by the disseminated information.  This includes persons who are seeking to address information about themselves as well as persons who use information@ (OFHEO, 5).  HHS took an even more open approach.  Rather than defining Aaffected person,@ HHS just asks the complainant to Adescribe how the person submitting the complaint is affected by the information error@ (HHS, 13). This invites the complainant to describe how he/she is affected, but specifically avoids any provision that would use this answer to limit or restrict who can point out an error in an agency=s dissemination of information.  

We prefer the HHS approach because it best ensures full public access to the complaint process, a goal of Section 515 and the OMB guidelines.  The focus of the complaint process should be on the merits of the complaint, not on the possible interests or qualifications of the complainant.   Other agencies need to adopt a similar approach.

Decision Criteria and Burden of Proof for Resolving Complaints.  Several agencies state that: ARequesters should be aware that they bear the >burden of proof= with respect to the necessity for correction as well as with respect to the type of correction they seek@ (Justice, 6).  Having the burden of proof on the complainant is consistent with the OMB guidelines and will be helpful in permitting agencies to dismiss frivolous or speculative complaints.  All agencies should make this clear in describing their complaint mechanism to the public.  We quote at the end of this attachment carefully presented statements of the decision criteria and approaches that several agencies plan to follow in resolving complaints. 

Time Periods for Resolving Complaints and Any Appeals.  The OMB guidelines state, AAgencies shall specify appropriate time periods for agency decisions on whether and how to correct the information, and agencies shall notify the affected persons of the corrections made ... The agency shall establish an administrative appeal process to review the agency=s initial decision, and specify appropriate time limits in which to resolve ... requests for reconsideration@ (III.3.i & ii).

Each agency must state in its guidelines the time periods for making decisions on both complaints and also on any appeals.  Exceptions for unusual cases are appropriate.

Some agencies set a time limit within which, after receiving notice of an initial decision, the complainant could file an appeal, generally 30 days.  Setting a time limit for filing appeals appears reasonable.

Some agencies also seek to set time limits for submission of original complaints (in effect, a form of a statute of limitations).  OMB has concerns about the potential unintended effects of such limits and will be reviewing them carefully.  Sometimes agencies continue, long after the agencies= initial dissemination, to adopt, endorse, or use information, and thus, in effect, continue to disseminate it.  Similarly, agencies may continue to maintain ongoing official agency data bases, publicly available through agency websites or other means, that serve agency program responsibilities and/or are relied upon by the public, that are, in effect, constantly being redisseminated.  The damaging effects of poor quality information may not occur or be perceived to have occurred until well after the information was originally disseminated.

An Objective Appeals Mechanism.  The preamble to the OMB guidelines discusses our intent that agencies establish an objective appeals mechanism.  ARecognizing that many agencies already have a process in place to respond to public concerns, it is not necessarily OMB=s intent to require these agencies to establish a new or different process.  Rather, our intent is to ensure that agency guidelines specify an objective administrative appeal process that, upon further complaint by the affected person, reviews an agency=s decision to disagree with the correction request.   An objective process will ensure that the office that originally disseminates the information does not have a responsibility for both the initial response and resolution of a disagreement@ (67 FR 8458, February 22, 2002).

Some agencies discuss how they plan institutionally to structure their complaint and appeal procedures.  Others do not.  We strongly suggest that agencies describe to the public how they plan to resolve any complaints and appeals in order to build public confidence in both the reality and appearance of a neutral, fair decision mechanism.

To enhance transparency, we also suggest that agencies provide the public with timely notice of what information the agency intends to correct after it makes a decision to correct it.  In the annual report to OMB, agencies should also this information as well as a status report on the numbers and kinds of petitions for corrections, appeals, and any denials or grants of petitions for reconsideration or appeals.  Agencies are encouraged, to the extent they practicably can, to give more timely disclosure of this information through, e.g.,  the use of electronic dockets or agency websites, they are encouraged to do so.

We note, in this regard, that a number of agencies emphasize that their guidelines are not intended to provide any right to judicial review.  A few agencies even stress that their guidelines may not be applicable based on unspecified circumstances and that the agency may be free to differ from the guidelines where the agency considers such action appropriate.   

Regardless of what kinds of litigation-oriented disclaimers the agencies may include, agency guidelines should not suggest that agencies are free to disregard their own guidelines.  Therefore, if you believe it is important to make statements that your agency=s guidelines are not intended to provide rights of judicial review, we ask that you not include extraneous assertions that appear to suggest that the OMB and agency information quality standards are not statements of government-wide policy, i.e., government-wide quality standards which an agency is free to ignore based on unspecified circumstances.  In addition, agencies should be aware that their statements regarding judicial enforceability might not be controlling in the event of litigation.


VI.  MELDING THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 515 INTO THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS OF OTHER STATUTES.
The agencies take a uniform approach to complaints filed concerning information disseminated in the course of conducting a rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act (providing public notice to obtain public comment, then issuing the regulation in final form).  The agencies meld the requirement to establish a Section 515 administrative mechanism to address public complaints into the procedures of the APA, NEPA, and other more specific public-comment statutes.  This melding of Section 515 complaint procedures into the structure of existing statutes seems reasonable, and is discussed extremely well by a number of agencies.  Of course, the substantive standards of quality, the information quality standards provided in the OMB and agency guidelines, remain applicable to any such dissemination of information.  Examples of well-reasoned agency statements are quoted at the end of this attachment.  

One of the agency discussions raises an interesting issue: 

Requests for Correction Concerning Information on Which DOJ Has Sought Public Comment. Information on which DOJ has sought public comment includes a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), studies cited in an NPRM, a regulatory evaluation or cost-benefit analysis pertaining to an NPRM, a preliminary environmental impact analysis, a notice of availability, and request for comment on a risk assessment.

DOJ's response to the request for correction will normally be incorporated in the next document it issues in the matter concerning which it had sought comment. The response will be provided in this document rather than in a separate communication.  DOJ may choose to provide an earlier response, if doing so is appropriate, and will not delay the issuance of the final action in the matter (Justice, 6).  

We suggest that Justice (and other agencies) explain in a little more detail the circumstances under which Aan earlier response@ might be Aappropriate@.  We are sensitive to the procedures and long history behind the Administrative Procedure Act.  However, we would suggest that agencies consider adding as criteria for making an early response a demonstration by a complainant of actual harm from the agency=s dissemination of a study relied upon in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or a demonstration by the complainant of substantial uncertainty as to whether the proposed rule will take an unusual length of time to go final.  

Another interesting issue arises when an agency disseminates a particular study in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), i.e., in the context of a particular agency policy decision, and a possible complainant has an interest in the study but not necessarily in the substantive policies embodied in the rulemaking.  The possible complainant may only learn that the agency has disseminated the study by reading the NPRM, possibly after the comment period has expired.  Agencies need to consider how those not directly interested in the rulemaking need to submit and receive consideration of a complaint about the study.  

As a general matter, we urge each agency to carefully articulate the ways in which the APA, NEPA, and other more specific public-comment statutes meld with and thus have the apparent effect of superseding the administrative mechanisms to address public complaints provided by Section 515.  For example, an agency may disseminate a risk assessment prior to publication of an NPRM.  While the agency may anticipate that this risk assessment may be used in support of the NPRM, the agency should still permit complainants to file complaints under Section 515 unless the publication of the NPRM is imminent.  Such a risk assessment may have impacts beyond the scope of the rulemaking.

OIRA REVIEW OF 
AGENCY DRAFT INFORMATION QUALITY GUIDELINES

Additional Quotations of 
Proposed Agency Provisions Organized by Topic 


I.  SCOPE OF AGENCY GUIDELINES.


Use of Statements of AIntent@ to Delimit Scope.  SSA and NSF use Aintent@ to indicate what is covered: e.g., Astatistical or actuarial information prepared for public dissemination; reports, studies and summaries prepared to inform the public@ (SSA, 2 of  2; NSF, 1).  

Justice uses intent to exempt Aprocedural, operational, policy and internal manuals prepared for the management and operations of DOJ that are not primarily intended for public dissemination@ (Justice, 3). 

Exemption for Press Releases.  FDA/HHS exempts press releases Aunless they contain new substantive information not covered by previous information dissemination@ (FDA/HHS, 3).  EPA adds a different qualifier: AThese guidelines do not apply to press releases, fact sheets, press conferences or similar communications in any medium that announce, support the announcement or give public notice of information EPA has disseminated elsewhere@ (EPA, 15). 

State also limits the scope of the press release exemption to apply to distributions of information or other materials that are Adistributed to the press as a summary of a recent event or Department action@ (State, 6).

Exemption for Public Filings.  

Distribution of information in public filings: Public filings include information submitted to EPA by any individual or person. ...  The guidelines do not apply where EPA distributes this information simply to provide the public with quicker and easier access to materials submitted to EPA that are publicly available. This will generally be the case if EPA has not authored the filings, and is not distributing the information in a manner that suggests that EPA endorses or adopts the information, and EPA does not indicate in its distribution that it is using or proposing to use the information to formulate or support a regulation, guidance, or other Agency decision or position (EPA, 16). 

Exclusion For Agency Employed Scientist, Grantee, or Contractor. 

A Component does not initiate the dissemination of information when a Component-employed scientist or Component grantee or contractor publishes and communicates his research findings in the same manner as his academic colleagues, even if the Component retains ownership or other intellectual property rights because the Component paid for the research.  To avoid confusion regarding whether the Component agrees with the information, the researcher should include an appropriate disclaimer ... that the views expressed are his own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Component.  In contrast ..., if the Component has directed a third party to disseminate information or retains the authority to review and approve the information upon release, then the Component has sponsored the dissemination of the information (DOD, 4).  

Distribution of information by federal employees and recipients of grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts: These guidelines do not apply to information distributed by recipients of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements, unless the information is disseminated on EPA=s behalf, as when EPA specifically directs or approves the dissemination. These guidelines do not apply to distribution of any type of research by federal employees and recipients of EPA grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts, where the researcher (not EPA) decides whether and how to communicate and publish the research, does so in the same manner as his or her academic colleagues, and distributes the research in a manner that indicates that the research does not represent EPA=s official position (for example, by including an appropriate disclaimer).  Distribution of research in this manner is not subject to these guidelines even if EPA retains ownership or other intellectual property rights because the Federal government paid for the research (EPA, 15-16).  

Exemption for Subpoenas or Adjudicative Processes. 

FMC explains this exemption succinctly: 
Excluded categories include: ...   Subpoenas or adjudicative processes, including Commission orders, opinions, amicus and other briefs.  Adjudicative processes also include factual allegations by the staff during the investigative and litigation phases of cases brought by the Commission's Bureau of Enforcement.  Because there are well-established procedural safeguards and rights to address the quality of factual allegations and adjudicatory decisions, and to provide persons with an opportunity to contest decisions, these guidelines do not impose any additional requirements on the Commission during adjudicative proceedings and do not provide parties to such adjudicative proceedings any additional rights of challenge or appeal (FMC, 7). 


II.  COVERAGE OF ATHIRD-PARTY@ INFORMATION UNDER THE GUIDELINES.

Agencies included Athird-party@ information under the guidelines in a variety of contexts:

Component dissemination of information prepared by an outside party in a matter that reasonably suggests the Component agrees with the information, renders Component dissemination of the information subject to these guidelines (DOD, 4).

Section III mentions an important concept that may not be immediately obvious to persons reading the OMB guidelines for the first time. As Dr. John Graham, Director [sic: Administrator] of the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and others have pointed out in meetings about the information quality guidelines, the standards for data quality that apply directly to Federal agencies also apply, at least indirectly, to outside parties who supply information to the Department. If the Department is to rely on technical, scientific, or economic information submitted by, for example, a commenter to a proposed rule, that information would need to meet appropriate standards of objectivity and utility. Numbers submitted by a commenter as the basis for a regulatory decision B which the Department would necessarily disseminate as part of a rulemaking issuance B should meet data quality standards no less than in the case of information the Department itself generates (DOT, 3). 

The standards of these guidelines apply not only to information that DOT generates, but also to information that other parties provide to DOT, if the other parties seek to have the Department rely upon or disseminate this information or the Department decides to do so (DOT, 8).

EPA disseminates information to the public for purposes of these guidelines when EPA initiates or sponsors the distribution of information to the public. EPA initiates a distribution of information if EPA prepares the information and distributes it to support or represent EPA=s viewpoint, to formulate or support a  regulation, guidance, or other Agency decision or position. EPA initiates a distribution of information if EPA distributes information prepared or submitted by an outside party in a manner that reasonably suggests that EPA endorses or agrees with it, if EPA indicates in its distribution that the information supports or represents EPA=s viewpoint, or if EPA in its distribution proposes to use or uses the information to formulate or support a regulation, guidance, policy, or other Agency decision or position (EPA, 14).

What happens if information is initially not covered by these guidelines, but EPA subsequently disseminates it to the public?  If a particular distribution of information is not covered by these guidelines, the guidelines may still apply to a subsequent distribution of the information in which EPA adopts, endorses or uses the information to formulate or support a regulation, guidance, or other Agency decision or position.   For example, if EPA simply makes a public filing (such as facility data required by regulation) available to the public, these guidelines would not apply to that distribution of information. However, if EPA later includes the data in a background document in support of a rulemaking, these guidelines would apply to that later dissemination of the information in that document (EPA, 17). 


III.  AGENCY COMMITMENT TO INFORMATION QUALITY STANDARDS.

Performance Standards.  Some agency guidelines adopted performance standards and a commitment to meeting them.  For example,  The Office of Special Counsel clearly states information quality standards as performance goals:

Information should adhere to a basic standard of quality ...  Information should be objective in substance and presentation ...  Information should be responsive to its intended users ...  The integrity of information should be protected (67 FR 21318, April 30, 2002).

Justice draft guidelines adopt the provision from the OMB guidelines relating to performance standards (III.1).

Overall, agencies shall adopt a basic standard of quality (including objectivity, utility, and integrity) and will take appropriate steps to incorporate information quality criteria into agency information dissemination practices ...  A basic standard of quality will be ensured and established for all information prior to its dissemination (Justice 1-2, 3).  

Then the Justice draft sets forth a standard and commits the DOJ components to reaching it:  

DOJ components will ensure disseminated information [meets the standard of objectivity] ... DOJ components will ensure information [meets the standard of integrity] (Justice, 4).

The Small Business Administration combines the approach taken by Justice:

It is SBA=s policy to ensure and maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of the information that it disseminates to the public. SBA will take appropriate steps to incorporate information quality criteria into SBA=s information dissemination practices, and will ensure the quality of information the agency disseminates in accordance with the standards set forth in these Guidelines. SBA is committed to integrating the principle of information quality into every step of SBA=s development of information, including creation, collection, maintenance, and dissemination. SBA will comply with all then-existing legal and policy rules, regulations, directives, and guidance at every step of the process (SBA, 4).

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission similarly sets standards and commits to reach them:  

The Commission strives to present information to the public in an accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased manner. ...  The Commission also aims to provide information that is accurate, reliable and unbiased (FERC 5, 6).

Core Definition of AObjectivity@.  The following are concise, accurate summaries of the heart of the OMB definition of Aobjectivity@:  

Objectivity involves two distinct elements; presentation and substance: 
(A) Presentation: 
Disseminate information in an accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased manner. This involves presenting information within a proper context. 
(B)  Substance: 
Focus on ensuring accurate, reliable, and unbiased information. 
In a scientific, financial, or statistical context, generate the original and supporting data, and develop the analytic results, using sound statistical and research methods (Treasury, 3).  

Objectivity means ensuring that information is accurate, reliable and unbiased and that information is presented in an accurate, clear, complete and unbiased manner (ERS/USDA, 7).   
AObjectivity@ focuses on whether the disseminated information is being presented in an accurate, clear, complete and unbiased manner and as a matter of substance, is accurate, reliable, and unbiased (DOD, 3). 

AInfluential@ and AReproducibility@.  DOT has a carefully considered discussion of influential.  Some highlights are: 

DOT emphasizes that to be influential, information must have a clear and substantial impact. A clear and substantial impact, first of all, is one that the agency is firmly convinced has a high probability of occurring ... In rulemaking, influential information is scientific, financial, or statistical information that can reasonably be regarded outcome determinative with respect to one or more key issues in a significant rulemaking, as that term is defined in Executive Order 12886 ...  In non-rulemaking contexts, DOT will consider two factors B breadth and intensity B in determining whether information is influential ...  DOT organizations should consider whether the information affects a broad range of parties ... DOT organizations will also consider whether the information has an intense impact.  Information that has a low cost or modest impact on affected parties is less likely to be influential than information that can have a very costly or crucial impact.  In considering whether information has a high-intensity impact, DOT organizations will establish and use as a benchmark the $100 million figure used to determine whether a rule is economically significant (DOT,  20-21).  

Justice also has a well-considered definition of influential:  
When information is defined as influential there is an added level of scrutiny afforded this information, to include the need to ensure it is reproducible.  At DOJ, influential information is that which is expected to have a genuinely clear and substantial impact at the national level, on major public and private policy decisions as they relate to federal justice issues.  The accuracy of this information is significant due to the critical nature of these decisions.  A clear and substantial impact, first of all, is one that the agency is firmly convinced has a high probability of occurring.  If it is merely arguable that an impact will occur, or if it is a close judgment call, then the impact is probably not clear and substantial.  To determine that there is a clear and substantial impact, the agency must have greater certainty than would be the case for many ordinary factual determinations.  The impact must be on ""important"" public policy or private sector decisions that are expected to occur. Even if information has a clear and substantial impact, it is not influential if the impact is not on a public or private decision that is important to policy, economic, or other decisions ... The ""influential"" designation is intended to be applied to information sparingly.  DOJ components should not designate information products or types of information as influential on a regular or routine basis.  Nor should DOJ components actually place an ""influential"" label in the title page or text of an information product (Justice,  4).

Both State and DOT, in describing Ainfluential@, emphasize the causal link between the information itself, and the effect it may have on the policy position involved: 

To be considered influential, information must be based on objective and quantifiable data that constitute a principal basis for substantive policy positions adopted by the Department (State, 6).

It should also be noted that the definition applies to Ainformation@ itself, not to decisions that the information may support. Even if a decision or action by DOT is itself very important, a particular piece of information supporting it may or may not be Ainfluential@ (DOT, 21).

Analysis of Risks to Human Health, Safety and the Environment.  FDA adapts the SDWA standards carefully and practically to the kinds of Risk Assessments that FDA conducts. 

Some of the influential information that we disseminate is based on an analysis of the risks to the public of certain actions or exposures to hazardous substances. For purposes of this guidance, we are defining risk as the likelihood that injury or damage is or can be caused by a substance, technology, or activity. We use risk analysis (the integration of risk assessment with risk management and risk communication) as a tool to enhance the scientific basis for all of our regulatory decisions. 

The OMB Guidelines provide special considerations that must be taken into account in certain risk assessments, those that provide the basis for the dissemination of influential information. The Guidelines state that ""With regard to analysis of risks to human health, safety, and the environment maintained or disseminated by the agencies, agencies shall either adopt or adapt the quality principles applied by Congress to risk information used and disseminated pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 (SDWA) (42 U.S.C. 300g-1(b)(3)(A) and (B)).@ 

The SDWA risk assessment principles are as follows: 

1. To the degree that the agency action is based on science, the agency shall use 

a.the best available, peer-reviewed science and supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound and objective scientific practices; 

b.data collected by accepted methods (if reliability of the method and the nature of the decision justify use of the data). 

2. In the dissemination of public information about risks, the agency shall ensure that the presentation of information about risk effects is comprehensive, informative, and understandable. 

3. In a document made available to the public in support of a regulation, the agency shall specify, to the extent practicable 

a.Each population addressed by any estimate of applicable risk effects; 
b.The expected risk or central estimate of risk for the specific populations affected 
c.Each appropriate upper-bound or lower-bound estimate of risk; 
d.Each significant uncertainty identified in the process of the assessment of risk effects and the studies that would assist in resolving the uncertainty; and
e.Peer-reviewed studies known to the agency that support, are directly relevant to, or fail to support any estimate of risk effects and the methodology used to reconcile the inconsistencies in the scientific data.

Many of our actions are based on scientific experts' judgments using available data, are essentially qualitative, and are generally carried out for non-cancer-causing hazards. Such assessments provide useful answers in most instances that are sufficient for regulatory purposes, and much more elaborate, quantitative estimates extrapolating beyond the data are unnecessary. For example, we may issue regulations on submission requirements for product approval applications, electronic submission of product labeling, or periodic reporting by manufacturers of adverse events from drugs; devices; and biologics, including blood, vaccines, and tissues. Although we analyze the economic costs of the regulations and consider alternatives, regulations like these do not lend themselves to the types of quantitative risk assessments contemplated by the Safe Drinking Water Act principles. 
Other actions are based on research and supporting data that are generated outside FDA. For example, most product approval actions are based on scientific studies conducted by sponsors seeking marketing approval in accordance with our regulations and guidance documents. Our regulations and guidance documents describe sound scientific practices for conducting human and animal studies of medical products and analyzing the resulting data. Most information in these studies is considered confidential commercial information and is closely held by the sponsors. As a result, formal peer-review of the data is rare. However, for certain drug approval applications, the safety and/or effectiveness information is presented to scientific advisory committees for recommendations. Evaluations of food safety and nutritional data are also presented to scientific advisory committees. 

As a result, we have adapted the general principles for risk assessments from the SDWA to fit these situations. The principles we intend to apply to risk assessments involving the dissemination of influential information affecting product approval actions or regulations that do not lend themselves to quantitative risk assessment are as follows: 

1. The Agency will use 

a.the best available science and supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound and objective scientific practices, including peer reviewed studies when available; and 
b.data collected by accepted methods (if reliability of the method and the nature of the decision justify use of the data). 

2. In the dissemination of public information about risks, the Agency will ensure that the presentation of information about risk effects is comprehensive, informative, and understandable. 

In situations requiring a quantitative risk assessment, we generally follow basic risk assessment principles in the NAS paradigm of 1983. Our needs for quantitative risk assessments range over a wide variety of hazards including physical hazards encountered during use of a medical device, food chemical residues, and antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria. Thus, we also ascribe to the statement from NAS when it revisited the risk assessment process in 1994 (Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment, NAS 1994): ""Risk assessment is not a single process, but a systematic approach to organizing and analyzing scientific knowledge and information.""  In each of the areas we regulate, we apply risk assessment practices to the specific task that are widely accepted among relevant domestic and international public health agencies. 

For quantitative risk assessments in support of the dissemination of influential information, FDA intends to apply the following principles: 

1. The agency will use- 

a.the best available science and supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound and objective scientific practices; 

b.data collected by accepted methods (if reliability of the method and the nature of the decision justifies use of the data). 

2. In the dissemination of public information about health risks, the agency shall ensure that the presentation of information is comprehensive, informative, and understandable, within the context of its intended purpose. 

3. In a risk assessment document made available to the public, the agency shall specify, to the extent practicable- 

a.Each population addressed by any estimate of applicable effects; 
b.The expected or central estimate of risk for the specific populations affected; 
c.Each appropriate upper-bound and/or lower-bound risk estimate; 
d.Data gaps and other significant uncertainties identified in the process of the risk assessment and the studies that would assist in reducing the data gaps; and 
e.Additional studies not used to produce the risk estimate that support or fail to support the findings of the assessment and the rationale of why they were not used (HHS/FDA, 18-20).


IV.  QUALITY INTEGRAL TO CREATION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.

Labor and USDA state the general principle extremely clearly: 

The quality assurance process should begin at the inception of the product development process (Labor, 5).

USDA agencies and offices will review the quality (including the objectivity, utility, and integrity) of information before it is disseminated and treat information quality as integral to every step of their development of information, including creation, collection, maintenance, and dissemination (USDA, 3). 

The Small Business Administration explicitly included Ainformation development@, Ainformation acquisition@, and Ainformation maintenance@ within the scope of its information quality guidelines:

When SBA develops information, it will use its enterprise architecture as a guide in building the groundwork for the information. This enterprise architecture will help define the goals for the information, information sharing requirements, original and supporting data needs, and all the applications for the information, among other things. SBA will determine and document all requirements for the information (SBA, 4).

At the information acquisition stage, SBA will remain cognizant of potential problems with information quality, including accuracy, currency, and completeness. Wherever possible during the information acquisition process, SBA will verify (assess completeness, accuracy, consistency, currency, timeliness) and validate (assess whether the data are appropriate for the measures it was collected to show) the data it collects, and scrub such data to correct problems.  SBA will use lessons learned from this process to improve its information acquisition procedures. SBA also will document limitations on data and other information as a result of problems discovered during the information acquisition stage that SBA could not correct before it disseminates the information (SBA, 4).

SBA will make every effort, within SBA=s available resources, to improve the information it maintains, including its data systems or processes. SBA will encourage feedback from both internal and external sources on the quality of SBA=s information, and will consider making changes to its information development and acquisition procedures to correct errors and other problems. SBA will conduct information quality assessments, including reviews and inspections of data, comparisons with other sources of similar data, and verification and validation of information and data. SBA also will take steps to ensure that the information SBA maintains remains secure from unauthorized access, revision, falsification, or corruption (SBA, 5).


V.  ADMINISTRATIVE MECHANISM TO ADDRESS PUBLIC COMPLAINTS.

Applicable Standards.  It is important that the administrative mechanism to address public complaints point out that agency failure to comply with either the OMB or the agency information quality standards can serve as a basis for complaint.  For example, AERS  has developed administrative mechanisms to allow affected persons to seek and obtain correction of information disseminated ... that does not comply with OMB, USDA, or ERS Information Quality Guidelines@ (ERS/USDA, 14).   By citing the OMB, department, and departmental component=s guidelines, ERS assures compliance with all of the applicable guidelines and this provision in its guidelines is consistent with the OMB guidelines. 

AAffected Persons@.  HHS and its components ask the complainant to Adescribe how the person submitting the complaint is affected by the information error@ (HHS, 13).  SEC invites the complainant to identify the perceived affect B Aan explanation of how the requestor is an affected person with regard to those facts or data@ (SEC, 7).  

SSA and FERC prevent the word Aaffected@ from having any limiting effect by not using it.  SSA and FERC make no mention of affected persons in their complaint procedures, and do not require the complainant to explain how he is affected (see, SSA, 1; FERC, 8).

Information Provided to the Agency.  HHS encourages complainants to provide needed detail. ARequests for correction that are specific and provide evidence to support the need for correction will enable the agency to provide a satisfactory response@ (HHS, 12). 

DOT takes the same approach: 

DOT may be unable to process, in a timely fashion or at all, requests that omit one or more of the requested elements. DOT will attempt to contact and work with requesters to obtain additional information when warranted (DOT, 15).

Decision Criteria and Burden of Proof for Resolving Complaints.   In the preamble to the OMB guidelines, OMB emphasized the discretion agencies had in deciding how to resolve complaints.

Overall, OMB does not envision administrative mechanisms that would burden agencies with frivolous claims.  Instead, the correction process should serve to address the genuine and valid needs of the agency and its constituents without disrupting agency processes.  Agencies, in making their determination of whether or not to correct information, may reject claims made in bad faith or without justification, and are required to undertake only the degree of correction that they conclude is appropriate for the nature and timeliness of the information involved, and explain such practices in their annual fiscal year reports to OMB (66 FR 49721, September 28, 2001).

Justice emphasizes the limits of its obligation:

After it has completed its review, DOJ will determine whether a correction is warranted, and, if so, what corrective action it will take.  Any corrective action will be determined by the nature and timeliness of the information involved and such factors as the significance of the error on the use of the information, the magnitude of the error, and the cost of undertaking a correction. DOJ is not required to change, or in any way alter, the content or status of information simply based on the receipt of a request for correction.  The Department need not respond substantively to frivolous or repetitive requests for correction.  Nor does the Department have to respond substantively to requests that concern information not covered by the guidelines or from a person whom the information does not affect (Justice, 6). 

State articulates the many different ways in which it may respond: 

Subject to applicable law, rules and regulations, corrective measures may include, without limitation, personal contacts via letter or telephone, form letters, press releases or postings on the Department website to correct a widely disseminated error or address a frequently raised request. Corrective measures, where appropriate, should be designed to provide reasonable notice to affected persons of any corrections made (State, 5).

Labor stresses practical constraints in correcting errors:

Any structured process would not apply to an agency=s archival information or to public filings. Agencies may choose not to respond to complaints about claimed defects that are frivolous or unlikely to have substantial future impact. It may not be in the public interest for agencies to devote significant resources to correcting information where the expenditure of such resources is not, in the agency=s view, cost effective in light of the significance of the asserted error, the benefits that are likely to be derived from such a correction, the costs of the correction, and the agency=s more pressing priorities and obligations (Labor, 7).

DOT includes economic concerns in its criteria for deciding what and how much to correct: 

The costs and benefits of using a higher quality standard or a more extensive review process will be considered in deciding the appropriate level of review and documentation (DOT,13).  When the DOT organization determines that a correction of the information is warranted, revisions/corrections to the information in question will begin as quickly as practicable. However, the Department=s budget, resources, and priorities, as well as the complexity of the correction task itself, may result in DOT actually taking this corrective action within a reasonable time after the Department has made the determination that a correction is appropriate (DOT, 18).

DOT plans to make both the complaint and subsequent DOT responses available on the web: 

In the administrative correction process, DOT will make extensive use of the internet accessible DMS. All requests for correction would come, in the first instance, to the DMS, whether electronically or in hard copy. By docketing requests for correction and subsequent DOT responses in the DMS, the Department will ensure the transparency of the request and response process. The DMS will also electronically notify DOT organizations of pending requests. In addition, filing requests with DMS will allow other interested parties to comment about or make requests with respect to an information issue. For example, suppose DOT publishes a study indicating that 75 percent of a certain kind of accident is caused by a component of a motor vehicle. Manufacturers of that component request correction of the study. Alerted to the request by the DMS posting, vehicle manufacturers could respond within 30 days. The Department seeks comment on this process (DOT, 3).

Time Periods for Resolving Complaints and Any Appeals and Notice to the Public.  

EPA takes an indirect approach to setting time limits on the filing of any complaints.  EPA exempts what it calls outdated or superseded information from being covered by the EPA guidelines: 

The guidelines do not apply to outdated or superseded EPA information that is provided as background information but no longer reflects EPA policy or influences EPA decisions, where EPA indicates (in a disclaimer or otherwise) that the materials are provided as background materials and do not represent EPA=s current view (EPA, 15).

An Objective Appeals Mechanism.  HHS requires that Athe agency official who handles the original complaint will not have responsibility for resolving the appeal@ (HHS, 13).  

Labor requires that: 
The agency should generally provide that the official conducting the second level review is not the same official that responded to the initial request or from the same office that prepared the information in question. Designated agency officials may consult with other agency or Departmental offices, as the agency may deem appropriate to the resolution of the complaint (Labor, 6).

When Interior agrees with an appeal, it also takes steps to notify the public of its decision by withdrawing the information from the public domain.

If at the end of the 45-day period, the bureau or office determines that the complaint is without merit, the complainant will be so notified.  If at the end of the 45-day period, the bureau or office determines that the complaint has merit, it shall so notify the complainant, the appropriate program or office, and it shall take reasonable steps to withdraw the information from the public domain and from any decision making process in which it is being used.  If the bureau or office determines that it will correct challenged information, it will notify the complainant of its intent and the corrective steps it proposes.  The bureau or office may determine the schedule and procedure for correcting the challenged information, but may not disseminate the challenged information in any form until it has been corrected.  Upon redisseminating corrected information, the bureau or office will provide the complainant with a copy of the corrected information (Interior, 2-3).


VI.  MELDING THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 515 INTO THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS OF OTHER STATUTES.

Treasury stated its position succinctly: 

Certain disseminations of information include a comprehensive public comment process (e.g., notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), regulatory analyses, and requests for comment on an information collection subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act). The administrative complaint mechanism described in these guidelines does not apply to such documents. Persons questioning information disseminated in such a document must submit comments as directed in that document. An additional complaint and appeal process for information that is already subject to a public comment process is inappropriate and unfair to other public commenters who submitted timely comments (Treasury, 6-7; Commerce took a similar approach, Commerce, 11).

DOT discusses this issue thoroughly:  

[T]here are some circumstances in which there is an existing process to respond to concerns expressed about the DOT=s information. The OMB guidelines encourage agencies to make use of existing processes in a flexible way, tailored to their programs. When there is a sound existing process, (such as a process that provides opportunities for public participation in making an agency decision), DOT organizations are asked not to duplicate that process with a separate request response mechanism.  For example, when an agency issues a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), it typically describes in the preamble the basis for its proposed regulatory provisions, which may include technical or scientific studies and a regulatory evaluation. In so doing, it disseminates these studies or evaluations, within the meaning of these guidelines. The public comment process can, and often does, generate views from interested persons about the soundness of the underlying information. If someone submits a request for correction pertaining to a document cited in an NPRM, DOT would treat it procedurally like a comment to the rulemaking, responding to it in the preamble of the final rule or a subsequent document such as a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPRM), rather than through the separate request response mechanism of these guidelines. The content of the response would address the issues of the document=s compliance with the information quality principles of the OMB and DOT guidelines. (DOT could choose to make an earlier correction, if warranted, assuming so doing would not delay the issuance of the final rule.) This approach would also apply to other processes involving a structured opportunity for public participation on a proposed document before a final document is issued, such as a draft environmental impact statement (EIS), an air quality conformity determination, or a Section 4(f) determination under the Department of Transportation Act ...

On the other hand, with respect to new information appearing for the first time in a final rule or EIS, DOT would consider a request for correction. The Department would not stay the final action involved. However, if it appeared that the information that was the subject of the request did not comply with the guidelines, and that, as a result, the final document was materially flawed, DOT would treat the matter as a request for reconsideration. In such cases, the Department would use any already existing mechanisms and procedures to reconsider corrections, such as the process to petition for a new rule or to request a Supplemental EIS. The submission of a request for correction by itself does not in any way affect the finality of a decision of the Department. 

We believe that this approach serves the purposes of the guidelines, affords an opportunity for correction of any material that does not comply with the guidelines, yet does not duplicate effort or interfere with the orderly progress of DOT=s work. We seek comment on this approach (DOT, 4-5).

This section concerns requests for correction concerning information on which a DOT organization has sought public comment (e.g., a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), studies cited in an NPRM, a regulatory evaluation or cost-benefit analysis pertaining to the NPRM; a draft environmental impact statement; a proposed policy notice or aviation order on which comment has been sought; a request for comments on an information collection subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act).

The DOT organization=s response to the request for correction will normally be incorporated in the next document it issues in the matter concerning which it had sought comment (e.g., in the case of an NPRM, the preamble to the final rule), DOT may choose to provide an earlier response, if doing so is appropriate and will not delay the issuance of the final action in the matter. Once again, the DOT organization will place their response in the DMS. As stated above ... , a DOT organization may reject a request for correction with respect to information in a final document if there was an opportunity for public comment or participation and interested persons could have requested the correction of the information at the proposed stage (DOT, 18).

If there is an existing process for reconsidering a particular sort of information disseminated by DOT, the DOT organization will make use of that process. For example, if the information relates to a final rule a DOT organization has issued, and the DOT organization has an existing process for handling requests for the reconsideration of a final rule, the DOT organization would use that process. If the information relates to a final EIS, the DOT organization may handle the request as though it were a request for a Supplemental EIS (DOT, 19).
 
Labor included this discussion with its public notice of the complaint mechanism: 

This process is not intended to substitute for other legally authorized processes, such as the Privacy Act or the rulemaking processes.  Concerns regarding information in a rulemaking must be presented in the rulemaking in accordance with the rulemaking=s procedures. ...  In deciding how to handle complaints, agencies should be especially mindful of their legal obligations, program priorities, resource constraints, and their duty to use resources efficiently. For example, agencies have important responsibilities to issue rules and provide compliance guidance to the public. Agencies must administer the complaint and appeal process consistent with these obligations and their responsibilities to carry them out in an expeditious manner (Labor,  6-7). 

DOT will reject a request for correction of information that could have been raised at the proposed rule stage:

With respect to information in a final rule, final environmental impact statement, or other final document on which there was an opportunity for public comment or participation, could interested persons have requested the correction of the information at the proposed stage?  If the DOT organization determines that the answer to [this] Question ... is Ayes,@ DOT will reject your request (DOT, 17).

I urge you to support passenger rail systems for our country.  Our aviation and highway systems receive billions of dollars of Federal support every year.  Yet Amtrak receives only a fraction of that kind of support.  I do not understand why.

The fact is our aviation and highway systems are reaching the saturation point.  Passenger rail can help.  You have only to look to Europe as an example of what rail is capable of achieving.  Now, more than ever, Americans would ride the rails if offered good dependable service.  Unfortunately, Amtrak suffers from lack of support.  Bless their hearts, they (Amtrak) do the best with what little they have.

By building our rail infrastructure, both passenger travel and commerce would benefit.  Freight railroads would be better able to move their customer's goods more efficiently.  This is good for American business.  It is a win-win situation.

On a political note, Amtrak seems to be a partisan subject in Washington.  Republicans tend to hate Amtrak.  Democrats tend to support Amtrak.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why passenger rail would be a partisan issue.  Transportation is an issue which I would think would be supported by all Americans. 

Sincerely,

Guy J. Meyer

When TEA-21 is finally reauthorized, I would like to see it unambiguously require minimum funding for forms of transportation that are an alternative to the automobile; transit, rail, bicycling, and pedestrians.  If possible, I would like these forms to get the same level of funding that are now offered for construction and improvements of roads and highways.

I know from bitter experience that continuing an almost-exclusive investment in roads and highways will not only fail to solve America's current transportation problems, but will in fact make them worse.

Until I moved to Colorado five years ago, I had spent virtually my entire life in the San Francisco Bay Area.  In the 60s, when I was a child, the Bay Area was a place of great physical beauty, with its towns and cities separated by large expanses of open space, and everyone enjoying a high quality of life.  

The residents of other states wanted to share that quality of life, however, and the state's population began to grow rapidly.

I watched as the Bay Area's farms, ranches, forests, and orchards were paved over as its cities attempted to cope with the growth by building more and larger systems of highways.  I watched the beauty, and the quality of life, slowly disappear.

Although initially a source of pride, the final result of the Bay Area's half-century investment in the automobile has been a complete disaster.  The automobile, once a symbol of freedom for Americans, for many has become a prison.  All of the Bay Area's state-of-the-art freeways are virtual parking lots all day long.  Commuting is a grinding nightmare for almost everyone, and people are forced to organize their lives around the rhythms of traffic.  Commute times of an hour each way are not uncommon.

The congestion is destroying the region's social infrastructure, as well.  Desperate to avoid spending hours in their cars, people are willing to pay anything to live close to where they work, and have driven the cost of housing so high that a middle-class lifestyle is almost unachievable even to those with good, high-paying jobs.

Attempts to increase road capacity have only made the situation worse.  Theextra capacity only induces more people to use the roads, so there's no improvement in the level of congestion.  Also, the cost of increasing highway capacity increases at a faster rate than the capacity does, so funding it becomes a larger and larger slice of the region's budget, robbing more and more money from other programs like education and health care.

The Bay Area is not alone in its experience.  Everywhere that it's been tried, an auto-centric transportation policy has been an abject failure.  It's failed in Los Angeles, Seattle, Washington D.C., Atlanta, Boston...basically any region that has seen an increase in population and tried to accommodate it with more roads.  They're trying it here in the Denver metro region, believing that it can work here; they're wrong.

The single-occupant vehicle is the least efficient, most subsidized, and most destructive form of transportation ever invented.  Our national investment in the automobile, almost to the complete exclusion of all other forms of transportation, has been a disaster for this nation.  The costs are unbelieveable; the destruction of the nation's open space, severe environmental pollution, reduction in our quality of life, not to mention the costs of the Gulf War, the War against Terrorism, or finally the cost of the attack on the World Trade Center.  

This nation desperately needs to make a strategic shift away from an exclusive dependence on the automobile to a transportation system that is balanced.

Thanks,
        Michael Evans

Key points which I hope will be included in your final proposal to Congress include:

1) Consideration of bicyclists and pedestrians in EVERY transportation project.  This should include making sure that cyclists and pedestrians can EASILY and SAFELY move through all bridges, intersections, and roads.  For example, pedestrians should not have to walk unreasonable distances to find places to cross roads, and cyclists should not be forced to dismount or move into gutters of onto the sidewalk in order to safely proceed.

- Strengthen Enhancements, CMAQ and other TEA-21 Programs
The majority of bicycle projects are currently funded through the popular and oversubscribed Transportation Enhancements programs. No additional categories should be added to the TE program. Explicit language on the eligibility of bicycle projects should be added to other categories, such as CMAQ, so that state DOT administer support for bicycling through these other programs as well.
I am writing to request you include more support for bicycling in our
transportation system.

- Improved motorist education.  Driver education and tests in all states should cover basic facts regarding sharing the road with bicycles.  For example, in order to pass licensing tests, motorists should know that bicycles have the right to ride in the road, and must be passed just as any other slow-moving vehicle would be passed.

Thank you for your consideration of these points.

	I am writing in regards to the reauthorization of the Surface Transportation Act that is planned for 2003.  While the current transportation act and its predecessor have done a lot to improve our nation's surface transportation infrastructure, much more can be done to insurer that additional resources are used to build an even more efficient transportation system.  In that regard, I urge that the renewal includes a provision that federal matching funds are made at the same level regardless of the mode of transportation of the project.

	As you are well aware at this point the federal government to provide to 80 percent match to the states for highway spending but only 50 percent for transit and the.  There is no match for intercity passenger rail.  This current system encourages states to choose to build highways as opposed to transit and spend very little money on intercity passenger rail. Yet highways cost much more to build and have less capacity to carry passengers and freight than do rail or transit. Thus the current system of federal funding encourages the use of less efficient modes of transportation in regards to fuel economy and cost.  I therefore request that the Administration urge Congress to pass a Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act that includes equitable funding for all ground transportation projects, including intercity passenger rail. 

	This would of course mean changing the current act to allow intercity passenger rail to be eligible for surface transportation act funds.  This, itself, would encourage more efficient transportation choices.  If we had a well-developed high-speed passenger rail system in this country people could choose to use this instead of our overcrowded highways and airports.  This would teach decrease the pressure to build new airports and runways in many areas and would help decrease the pressure (and costs of) on the new Transportation Security Agency.  This all of us would help save the federal government money.  In addition it would encourage the use of passenger rail which is much more fuel-efficient than private automobiles or airplanes.  Thus decreasing our need for importing oil. Unfortunately we do not have a well-developed high-speed passenger rail system, because we as a nation have not invested in them as we have our highways and airways.  By including intercity passenger rail in the Surface Transportation Act we would begin investing in such a system.

Thank you for considering my comments on funding equity regardless of surface transportation mode and the inclusion of intercity passenger rail rail in the new reauthorization act.

Sincerely,

M. Jacob Adams, M.D.

We have reviewed the proposed changes for the Management Information Systems reporting form and have made the following determinations:

Data Elimination:  The elimination of Data on the proposed (MIS) form will greatly enhance the efficiency and we believe, the accuracy of reported statistical data as it pertains to Part 40.  When discussed by our officers, one objection was made to the total elimination of supervisory data.  All operating agencies require that some supervisory personnel be trained in recognizing the signs/symptoms of drug and alcohol misuse.  We believe that to totally eliminate the supervisory requirements might serve to de-emphasize the importance of such individuals.  We suggest changing the portions that required supervisor initial training data to a more informative/pertinent category titled number of employed supervisors who have received training.

The idea of bringing uniformity to the way each agency totals the number of employees for the applicable periods was well received.  The proposed method for handling cancelled tests/refusals will bring a needed delineation to reporting requirements.  It was also agreed that the refusal subcategories add a certain clarity to the report.  

Our greatest concern, with reporting usually lies in contractor monitoring.  Many large companies often contract with outside sources to verify/assure compliance of subcontractors.  This results in a huge workload as each private monitoring company requests different information.  It is not unusual that these private monitors request too much or too little information.  We maintain that information not contained on the MIS form
should not be required by third party auditors and that companies who refuse to provide excess private information not be assigned out of compliance, unacceptable, or unsatisfactory designations with these companies.  For DOT regulated companies, this amounts to an extra, unnecessary regulatory burden.

I recommend that tests that are cancelled due to a legitimate shy bladder condition for a random test be counted toward the total number of tests required to meet the random testing rate requirement.  I agree that all other tests that are cancelled should not be counted.  However, failure to provide a urine specimen for which no shy bladder condition is found is counted as a refusal to test.  In like manner legitimate shy bladder conditions in random testing should be counted toward meeting the random testing rate even though they are cancelled tests.

It is a cumbersome and burdensome requirement to not count the first test of a situation in which the first test is a Negative-Dilute and the employer sends the employee in for a second test.  The regulations are quite clear that the second test result is the result of record.  Current DOT regulations do not specify that the first test result is to be cancelled and both tests are retained in MROs and TPAs database systems as a Negative test.  If these two tests are one testing event then the DOT regulations should specify that the first test be cancelled.  Without this change the first test remains Negative-Dilute and the various database systems from which the information is drawn to complete the MIS reports will be unable to exclude this first test result from the total count.

The proposed procedure by which the total number of employees is determined will present a cumbersome burden for those large companies that perform a random selection on a weekly or daily basis.  In a daily random selection process the proposed rule would require the addition of 365 entries for the number of employees.  Perhaps there could be a maximum requirement of monthly (12) periods over which the number of employees is calculated for those companies who perform their random selection on a more frequent basis than once each month.  Such companies could select the employee count on the date of the first ransom selection within the more frequent schedule (first selection in a month) as the count for that time period and divide by twelve.  In addition, the Part 40 rules should make it clear that, whatever method of counting employees is finally selected, it is carried forward into the individual OAs rules.  Currently OAs and individual auditors have different methods of calculating the total number of employees to which the random testing rate is to be applied.  Clarification is required across all OA rules to remove these discrepancies.

I support the concept of an electronic Internet-based MIS submission form.  There are many advantages to this type of system as are pointed out in the NPRM.  However, the proposed form does require the signature of the Certifying Official.  A mechanism that is used by other organizations who use Internet-based data submission but still require a Certifying Official signature is to require that the completed form be printed, signed, and mailed upon completion of the online submission process.  This step should be added to the proposed rules.

I support having a one-page report for each companys submission.  Even though some OAs require data for multiple occupation types (such as FAA and FTA) and companies in these transportation modes would have to file a separate report for each occupation type, the net is still fewer pages of reports and a consolidated reporting format..

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this NPRM.

Sincerely,

James M. Vanderploeg, MD
